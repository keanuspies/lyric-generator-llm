"Die Young"

Run with the devil, go ahead run free
Run with the devil and dream
Smoke that cigarette, puff those rings
Blow it in my face as I breathe
It's alright now, you're just high now
You'll be fine now, you're just high now

Look at your mama, now she's crying
'Cause she thinks her baby's dying
Don't put up a fight, she just wants to hold you tight
And look at your daddy, he hates lying
Tried to help you, but he's sick of trying
Look at your life, he just wants to make it right
And you got everything and more than enough
If you could have anything, what would you want

You say, "I wanna die young"
Wanna die young
You say, "I wanna die young"
Wanna die young

Sleep with the devil, go dance with him
It's your life, do what you want to
Baby, why you so locked up in lies
Don't you know you could have the truth
You say I'm boring, so you ignore me
You hear the phone ring, so you ignore me

Look at your mama, now she's crying
'Cause she thinks her baby's dying
Don't put up a fight, she just wants to hold you tight
And look at your daddy, he hates lying
Tried to help you, but he's sick of trying
Look at your life, he just wants to make it right
And you got everything and more than enough
If you could have anything, what would you want

You say, "I wanna die young"
Wanna die young
You say, "I wanna die young"
Wanna die young

You say "I don't know how I lost myself"
With a bottle at the bottom of an ashtray
Smoking my regrets and realizing what I need to do is pray

And I know I've got more than enough
And I think I know now what I really want

And I think I want love, wanna find love
And I wanna be loved, wanna find love
And I sure as hell don't wanna die young
Don't wanna die young, wanna die young

"Good Hurt"

I know I'm impatient
Bite your tongue or I'll do it for you
You can taste hesitation
Mouth to mouth conversation
And I've even tried medication
Cold hearted frustration
You can call it foundation
I'll call you when I'm wasted

Oh, I should know better
Oh, I should know better

All I really want is that good hurt
I know in my head I could do better
No one else compares to who I had first
All I really want is that good hurt
That good hurt
That good hurt

Lied when I said I love you
Didn't mean to say it but I
Know you're not delusional
Guess that I was manipulative
You can call me Medusa
Bite you good but I'll leave you colder
Use me just like I used you
Till it's over

Oh, I should know better
Oh, I should know better

All I really want is that good hurt
I know in my head I could do better
No one else compares to who I had first
All I really want is that good hurt
That good hurt
That good hurt

I guess I will lay here while you move
And think it through but I can't help but wish that it was you
On my body, make good hurt stay
I just wanna feel that pain

All I really want is that good hurt
I know in my head I could do better
No one else compares to who I had first
All I really want is that good hurt
That good hurt
That good hurt

"Meantime"

I first left to a summer camp
Feel my skeleton, can you make my brittle bones strong
Remember when we talked so long
Quiet behind bedroom walls
The light made your eyes so big

And I keep my doubts in the back of my mind
And I still love you in the meantime
Cut me slack while I figure it out
And I still love you in the meantime

In the meantime
Can I love you in the meantime

And I keep my doubts in the back of my mind
And I still love you in the meantime
Cut me slack while I figure it out
And I still love you in the meantime

In the meantime
Can I love you in the meantime
In the meantime
Can I love you in the meantime

Twist me, licorice
Speak with your fingertips
Tell me what you want me to do
Can you meet me by the swimming pool
After hours, when the air is cool
I've got things I don't know how to say

Can I love you in the meantime
Can I love you in the meantime

"Sugar High"

Chocolate covered lover, you've never been so sweet before
Open our bodies, I quietly knock on your door
I-I-I just wanna sweet talk for awhile
Whisper all the things I absolutely adore
About your smile, it's like I'm in a candy store
Oh-h-h, I love your sugar coating words

Maybe it's the way the honey drips off of your lips
Maybe it's the taste of your caramel apple kiss

And your heart is so sweet, all that sugar loving, it belongs to me
Candy man, you are mine
You know how you get me, get me sugar high
High, oh, high
High, oh, high

Your cotton candy voice melts in my mouth as you speak
Beautiful boy, your words are made of poetry
I-I-I could listen to you all day

Maybe it's the way you laffy taffy love
Maybe it's the way you run your hands up my back

And your heart is so sweet, all that sugar loving, it belongs to me
Candy man, you are mine
You know how you get me, get me sugar high
High, oh, high
High, oh, high

Maybe it's the way you lay me down at night
Or how you turn November into hot summer July

And your heart is so sweet, all that sugar loving, it belongs to me
Candy man, you are mine
You know how you get me, get me sugar high

"Bad For You"

You know that I won't hold you back
When you think of things you shouldn't
Things you want to do to me
Bare skin to sink my teeth in
Wrap my tongue around you as I hold you with my lungs

I bet you wonder what I'm doing when I'm alone in my room
When I'm alone in my room
And darling, I'm telling you it comes easy when I'm thinking about you
When I'm thinking about you

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you

Goddess, I'll be your goddess
Lace your fingers round my neck, it's pleasure I can't take

Bet I know exactly what you're doing when you're alone in your room
When you're alone in your room
Darling, tell me if you're having trouble and I'm sure I could help you
I'm sure I could help you

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you

Blood on your back
I give you your pride
I am all yours and you are all mine

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you

"Femininomenon"

Same old story, time again
Got so close but then you lost it
Should've listened to your friends
About his girlfriend back in Boston
You sent him pictures and playlists and phone sex
He disappeared from the second that you said
"Let's get coffee, let's meet up"
I'm so sick of online love
And I don't understand
Why can't any man

Hit it like...
Get it hot...
Make a bitch...
It's a fem...
Hit it like...
Get it hot...

Hit it like rom-pom-pom-pom (Hit it like)
Get it hot like Papa John (Get it hot)

It's a femininomenon (It's a fem)

So let's say it's working out
You pretend to love his mother
Lying to your friends about
How he's such a goddamn good lover
Stuck in the suburbs, you're folding his laundry
Got what you wanted so stop feeling sorry
Crying at the nail salon
I'm so sick of online love
And I don't understand
Why can't any man

Hit it like...
Get it hot...
Make a bitch...
It's a fem...
Hit it like...
Get it hot...
Make a bitch...
It's a-

And you know what you need

But does it happen (No)

Well, what we really need is a femininomenon

"Red Wine Supernova"

She was a playboy
Brigitte Bardot
She showed me things
I didn't know
She did it right there
Out on the deck
Put her canine teeth
In the side of my neck

I'm in the hallway waitin' for ya
Mini skirt and my go-go boots

So slow down, sit down, it's new

Let's make this bed get squeaky

Baby, why don't you come over
Red Wine Supernova
Falling into me
I don't care that you're a stoner
Red Wine Supernova
Fall right into me

"After Midnight"

My mama said nothing good happens
When it's late and you're dancing alone
She's in my head saying it's not attractive
Wearing that dress and red lipstick

This is what I wanted, this is what I like
I've been a good, good girl for a long time
But baby, I like flirting, a lover by my side
Can't be a good, good girl even if I tried

'Cause after midnight
I'm feeling kinda freaky, maybe it's the club lights
I kinda wanna kiss your girlfriend if you don't mind
I love a little drama, let's start a bar fight

'Cause everything good happens after midnight
I'm feeling kinda freaky, maybe it's the moonlight
I kinda wanna kiss your boyfriend if you don't mind
I love a little uh-huh, let's watch the sunrise
'Cause everything good happens after

I really want your hands on my body
A slow dance, baby, let's get it on
That's my type of fun, that's my kind of party
Your hands on my body, your hot hands

This is what I wanted, this is what I like
I've been a good, good girl for a long time
But baby, I like flirting, a lover by my side
Can't be a good, good girl even if I tried

'Cause after midnight
I'm feeling kinda freaky, maybe it's the club lights
I kinda wanna kiss your girlfriend if you don't mind
I love a little drama, let's start a bar fight

'Cause everything good happens after midnight
I'm feeling kinda freaky, maybe it's the moonlight
I kinda wanna kiss your boyfriend if you don't mind
I love a little uh-huh, let's watch the sunrise
'Cause everything good happens after midnight

Baby, put your hands up
Be a freak in the club
Yeah, we'll make a move then we're making out
Yeah, we'll make, a-make love

Yeah, we'll make, a-make love
Be a freak in the club
Be a freak in club

After midnight
I'm feeling kinda freaky, maybe it's the club lights (Club lights)
I kinda wanna kiss your girlfriend if you don't mind (If you don't, if you don't mind)
I love a little drama, let's start a bar fight (Everybody wants make a little love, get drunk)

'Cause everything good happens after midnight
I'm feeling kinda freaky, maybe it's the moonlight (Moonlight)
I kinda wanna kiss your boyfriend if you don't mind (If you don't, if you don't mind)
I love a little uh-huh, let's watch the sunrise
'Cause everything good happens after

"Coffee"

Can't meet you for dinner at the Italian place
It's where I met your family, some words were exchanged
I'd suggest the jazz bar on MaryAnn Street, but
You'd buy me a drink, and we know where that leads, so

I'll meet you for coffee 'cause if we have wine
You'll say that you want me, I know that's a lie
If I didn't love you, it would be fine
I'll meet you for coffee, only for coffee
Nowhere else is safe, every place leads back to your place

You said let's do the park, 'cause I love the park
That may be true, but God forbid it gets dark
Here come the excuses that fuel the illusions
But I'd rather feel something than nothing at all, so

I'll meet you for coffee 'cause if we have wine
You'll say that you're sorry, I know that's a lie
If I didn't trust you, it would be fine
I'll meet you for coffee, only for coffee
Nowhere else is safe, every place leads back to your-

We've done this before
And I don't need it anymore

So let's not do coffee, let's not even try
It's better we leave it and give it some time
If I didn't love you, it would be fine
'Cause If we do coffee, it's never just coffee
It's never just coffee

"Casual"

My friends call me a loser
'Cause I'm still hanging around
I've heard so many rumors
That I'm just a girl that you bang on your couch
I thought you thought of me better
Someone you couldn't lose
You said, "We're not together"
So now when we kiss, I have anger issues

You said, "Baby, no attachment"
But we're...

Knee deep in the passenger seat and you're eating me out
Is it casual now
Two weeks and your mom invites me to her house on Long Beach
Is it casual now
I know what you tell your friends
It's casual, if it's casual now
But baby, get me off again
If it's casual, it's casual now

Dumb love, I love being stupid
Dream of us in a year
Maybe we'd have an apartment
And you'd show me off to your friends at the pier

I know, "Baby, no attachment"
But we're...

Knee deep in the passenger seat and you're eating me out
Is it casual now
Two weeks and your mom invites me to her house on Long Beach
Is it casual now
I know what you tell your friends
It's casual, if it's casual now
But baby, get me off again
If it's casual, oh, oh, oh

It's hard being casual
When my favorite bra lives in your dresser
It's hard being casual
When I'm on the phone talking down your sister
And I try to be the chill girl that
Holds her tongue and gives you space
I try to be the chill girl but
Honestly, I'm not

Knee deep in the passenger seat and you're eating me out
Two weeks and your mom invites me to her Long Beach house
I know what you tell your friends
Baby, get me off again
I fucked you in the bathroom when we went to dinner
Your parents at the table, you wonder why I'm bitter
Bragging to your friends I get off when you hit it
I hate to tell the truth but I'm sorry dude you didn't
I hate that I let this drag on so long, now I hate myself
I hate that I let this drag on so long, you can go to hell

"Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl"

You know what they say, "Never waste a Friday night on a first date"
But there I was, in my heels with my hair straight
And so I take him to this bar, this man wouldn't dance
He didn't ask a single question
And he was wearing these fugly jeans
It doesn't matter though, he doesn't have what it takes to be
With a girl like me

Not overdramatic, I know what I want
We're leaving the planet and you can't come

Uh-huh, I'm through with all these hyper mega bummer boys like you
Oh yeah, I need a super graphic ultra modern girl like me
We're hot, we're drunk, wow, look at her moving, baby, she's the one
Oh yeah, I need a super graphic ultra modern girl like me

Telling secrets there on the mattress
Wearing nothing but glitter and lashes
At every party we're the party, shaking our asses
Making out while the world collapses

Not overdramatic, I know what I want
We're leaving the planet and you can't come

Uh-huh, I'm through with all these hyper mega bummer boys like you
Oh yeah, I need a super graphic ultra modern girl like me
We're hot, we're drunk, wow, look at her moving, baby, she's the one
Oh yeah, I need a super graphic ultra modern girl like me
(Shake it for me)

Get up off your feet, get up on that bar
Walk that walk from Tokyo to New York
With everything you feel and everything you are
Walk that walk, flash the camera, flash the camera, flash the camera, you're a star

Uh-huh, I'm through with all these hyper mega bummer boys like you
Oh yeah, I need a super graphic ultra modern girl like me
We're hot, we're drunk, wow, look at her moving, baby, she's the one
Oh yeah, I need a super graphic ultra modern
Ooh, you got me la-la-la-ing
Hyper-sexy top to bottom
Girl like me

"HOT TO GO"

Five, six
Five, six, seven, eight

I could be the one or your new addiction
It's all in my head, but I want non-fiction
I don't want the world, but I'll take this city
Who can blame a girl Call me hot, not pretty

Baby, do you like this beat
I made it so you'd dance with me
It's like a hundred ninety-nine degrees
When you're doing it with me, doing it with me

No one's touched me there in a damn hot minute

And baby, don't you like this beat
I made it so you'd sleep with me
It's like a hundred ninety-nine degrees

"My Kink Is Karma"

We broke up on a Tuesday
Kicked me out with the rent paid
Ruined my credit, stole my cute aesthetic
Who knew that we'd let it
Get this bad when it ended

It's comical, bridges you burn
Karma's real, hope it's your turn
I heard from Katie
You're losing it lately
Moved back with your parents
And date girls who're eighteen

It's hot when you have a meltdown
In the front of your house and you're getting kicked out
It's hot when you're drinking downtown
And you're getting called out 'cause you're running your mouth
Oh, God
And it's coming around, yeah, it's coming around, yeah, it's coming around
Oh, God, oh, God
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching

You ruining your life
You losing your mind
You dyeing your hair
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching
You crashing your car
You breaking your heart
You thinking I care
People say I'm jealous but my kink is karma

Wishing you the best, in the worst way
Using your distress as foreplay
Six months since April and I'm doing better
No need to be hateful in your fake Gucci sweater

But it's hot when you have a meltdown
In the front of your house and you're getting kicked out
It's hot when you're drinking downtown
And you're getting called out 'cause you're running your mouth
Oh, God
And it's coming around, yeah, it's coming around, yeah, it's coming around
Oh, God, oh, God
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching

You ruining your life
You losing your mind
You dyeing your hair
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching
You crashing your car
You breaking your heart
You thinking I care
People say I'm jealous but my kink is karma

It's hot when you're going through hell
And you're hating yourself, I'm feeling myself
It's hot when you know that you're caught
And you're getting pissed off, it's getting me off
It's hot, it's hot
Oh, God, oh, God
Oh, God
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching

You ruining your life
You losing your mind
You dyeing your hair
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching
You crashing your car
You breaking your heart
You thinking I care
People say I'm jealous but my kink is karma

"Picture You"

Draw the blinds, light every candle
Slip off my pretty dress, down my chest when I think of you
Every night, both lips on the mirror
It's ritualistic, counting lipstick stains where you should be

Oh, I need you around
I'm getting close now

Do you picture me like I picture you
Am I in the frame from your point of view
Do you feel the same I'm too scared to say
Half of the things I do when I picture you

So tell me now, all your perversions
Tell me now
Am I doing research in a mini skirt
Am I
At the library in your hometown

Oh, I need you around
I'm getting close now

Do you picture me like I picture you
Am I in the frame from your point of view
Do you feel the same I'm too scared to say
Half of the things I do when I picture you
When I picture you

Do you picture me like I picture you
Am I in the frame from your point of view
Do you feel the same I'm too scared to say
Half of the things I do when I picture you

"Kaleidoscope"

Here we go again
Everything is fine
I guess we could pretend
We didn't cross a line
But ever since that day
Everything has changed
The way I write your name
The cursive letter A
Whenever it may be
That you go on your way
If you really wanna leave
I'll never make you stay
Whatever you decide
I will understand
And it will all be fine
Just go back to being friends

And love is a kaleidoscope
How it works we'll never know
And even all the change
Is somehow all the same
Turnin' to the left and right
Colors shining in your eye
And even upside down
It's beautiful somehow
It's never just a shape alone
Love is a kaleidoscope

And if you ever find
Someone who could write
A better song for you
Well I'd love to see them try
Put it all in words
And sing it all in tune
There's no one else who could
The only one is you
And if you change your mind
I will understand
And it'll just take time
To go back to being friends

And love is a kaleidoscope
How it works we'll never know
And even all the change
Is somehow all the same
Turning to the left and right
Colors shining in your eye
And even upside down
It's beautiful somehow

Every color of the rainbow
Don't be afraid to hold it close
It's never just a shape alone
Love is a kaleidoscope

"Pink Pony Club"

I know you wanted me to stay
But I can't ignore the crazy visions of me in LA
And I heard that there's a special place
Where boys and girls can all be queens every single day

I'm having wicked dreams
Of leaving Tennessee
Oh, Santa Monica
I swear it's calling me
Won't make my mama proud
It's gonna cause a scene
She sees her baby girl
I know she's gonna scream

God, what have you done
You're a pink pony girl
And you dance at the club
Oh mama, I'm just having fun
On the stage in my heels
It's where I belong down at the
Pink Pony Club
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony Club
I'm gonna keep on dancing down in
West Hollywood
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony Club, Pink Pony Club

I'm up and jaws are on the floor
Lovers in the bathroom and a line outside the door
Blacklights and a mirrored disco ball
Every night's another reason why I left it all

I thank my wicked dreams
A year from Tennessee
Oh, Santa Monica
You've been too good to me
Won't make my mama proud
It's gonna cause a scene
She sees her baby girl
I know she's gonna scream

God, what have you done
You're a pink pony girl
And you dance at the club
Oh mama, I'm just having fun
On the stage in my heels
It's where I belong down at the
Pink Pony club
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony club
I'm gonna keep on dancing down in
West Hollywood
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony club, Pink Pony club

Don't think I've left you all behind
Still love you and Tennessee
You're always on my mind
And mama, every Saturday
I can hear your southern drawl a thousand miles away, saying

God, what have you done
You're a pink pony girl
And you dance at the club
Oh mama, I'm just having fun
On the stage in my heels
It's where I belong down at the
Pink Pony Club
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony Club
I'm gonna keep on dancing down in
West Hollywood
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony Club, Pink Pony Club

I'm gonna keep on dancing
I'm gonna keep on dancing

"Naked In Manhattan"

Hi, it's Chappell, I know you just landed
And I know you're probably busy but
I would love to see you so
Call me when you can

New crush, high school love again
The rush of slumber party kissing
Don't touch, I'll never cross the line
So I pushed you down a million times
I'd love if you knew you were on my mind
Constant like cicadas in the summertime
Boys suck and girls I've never tried
And we both know we're getting drunk tonight

Touch me, baby, put your lips on mine
Could go to hell but we'll probably be fine
I know you want it, baby, you can have it
Oh, I've never done it, let's make it cinematic
Like that one sex scene that's in Mulholland Drive
I wanna know, baby, what is it like
I know you want it, baby, you can have it
Oh, I've never done it, naked in Manhattan

Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)
Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)

A pisces who knew that we were so aligned
When I sing that Lana song, it makes you cry
Mean Girls, we watch it every night
And we both have a crush on Regina George
You love peach and ice cream
Bedazzled, Chanel rings
In New York, you can try things
An inch away from more than just friends

Touch me, baby, put your lips on mine
Could go to hell but we'll probably be fine
I know you want it, baby, you can have it
Oh, I've never done it, naked in Manhattan

Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)
Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)

Red lips and lip gloss
French kissing and crystals
But don't try and it's my loss
An inch away from more than just friends

Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)
Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)

Won't you fucking touch me
I just want to touch you (Naked in Manhattan)
I want more than you know (Naked in Manhattan)
Oh, oh, oh (Naked in Manhattan)
Naked in Manhattan

"California"

I stretched myself across four states
New lands, west coast, where my dreams lay
I trade amber clay roads for the
Sea foam and the endless sun rays

'Cause I was never told that I wasn't gonna get
The things I want the most
But people always say, "If it hasn't happened yet
Then maybe you should go"

Come get me out of California
No leaves are brown
I miss the seasons in Missouri
My dying town
Thought I'd be cool in California
I'd make you proud
To think I almost had it going
But I let you down

Too hard, to find reasons to stay
Even true love could not persuade

'Cause I was never told that I wasn't gonna get
The things I want the most
But people always say, "If it hasn't happened yet
Then maybe you should go"

Come get me out of California
No leaves are brown
I miss the seasons in Missouri
My dying town
Thought I'd be cool in California
I'd make you proud
To think I almost had it going
But I let you down

Come get me out
Come get me out
Come get me out
Come get me out

Come get me out of California
No leaves are brown
I miss the seasons in Missouri
My dying town
Thought I'd be cool in California
I'd make you proud
To think I almost had it going
But I let you down

"Guilty Pleasure"

Learned it on the internet
Wheels turning in my head
Think back to what you said
And I turn red, I'm turning red

Wild thoughts that make me melt
A good hit below the belt
Sometimes I scare myself
But I can't help what I can't help

So shame on me and shame on you
I fantasize what we would do
And how would he taste and the way you move
Oh, some good girls do bad things too

I want this like a cigarette
Can we drag it out and never quit And
Oh my God, you are heaven-sent
With your dirty mind, yeah, you're perverted
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure

Feels like pornography watching you try on jeans
You're a pothead, you're a cinephile
It's been awhile since you turned up the dial

So shame on me, shame on you
I fantasize what we would do
And how would it taste, the way you move
Oh, some good girls do bad things too

I want this like a cigarette
Can we drag it out and never quit And
Oh my God, you are heaven-sent
With your dirty mind, yeah, you're perverted
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure

You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure, pleasure, pleasure, pleasure...

"Bitter"

Oh God, tell me that I'm not insane
With a toy gun hanging in my mouth
I'm made of jade and I'm feeling pretty jaded
It's a problem that I'll never ever figure out

Take pills for your double black eyes
Said I pack a punch and give it to ya
Don't promise you'll do better next time
I know never to believe ya

I love being bitter
It makes me feel better
Bitter feels better than tryna get better and I
Yes, I love being bitter
But it makes me feel weathered
Now I'm sick in the head and it's not even my fault
Now I'm sick in the head and it's not even my fault

I used to laugh like the cartoon children
I wasn't always this way
Once sweet like an orange creamsicle
Or lemon icing on the cake

Bite hard when I try to be nice
I know exactly what you want
Cut clean when I twist that knife
No one falls for the villain

But I love being bitter
Yeah, it makes me feel better
Bitter feels better than tryna get better and I
Yes, I love being bitter
But it makes me feel weathered
Now I'm sick in the head and it's not even my fault
Now I'm sick in the head and it's not even my fault

I'm unaware just give me some time, I'm
Having trouble fighting wars in my mind
Take it easy, take it easy

I don't care that I'm on your shelf 'cause
I'm pretty good at talking to myself
Take it easy, take it easy

Take it easy
Take it easy
Take it easy

Yes, I love being bitter
'Cause it makes me feel better
Now I'm sick in the head and I think it's my fault
Now I'm sick in the head and I think it's my fault

"Love Me Anyway"

I love you because you have those Polaroids of me inside your nightstand
And I love you because you're understanding when I'm too shy to show my skin

Sometimes I forget, wasn't always this way
It's hard to admit, I was the one to blame

When I met you at summer camp
I would never give you the chance
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
Autumn came and December went
Turned you down at your high school dance
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway

I love you because when I say "I don't wanna talk" you always call me
And I love you because you lead me back to bed when I wander in my sleep

Sometimes I forget, wasn't always this way
It's hard to admit, I was the one to blame

When I met you at summer camp
I would never give you the chance
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
Autumn came and December went
Turned you down at your high school dance
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway

And after all this time, you were right
Can we take more Polaroids for you to hide

When I met you at summer camp
I would never give you the chance
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
Autumn came and December went
Turned you down at your high school dance
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
Anyway

"School Nights"

I'm feeling childish
When you draw tattoos on my forearm
Pop bubblegum too loud
We got them preachin' that we're hell-bound

But I don't think we are unless you do

I wanna be a kid with you
Talk slow on a school night
And you can disregard my virgin ears and say what you like
You wanna win me over now
Impress me like a school fight
And I triple-dog dare ya
To pinky-promise that you'll never lie
Ooh ooh oh

We light firecrackers in the middle of the street
You hear them yellin' at us
But you, listen to me
As I pour my voice in your soul
You say "goddamn let's never get old," and
I agree

I wanna be a kid with you
Talk slow on a school night
And you can disregard my virgin ears and say what you like
You wanna win me over now
Impress me like a school fight
And I triple-dog dare ya
To pinky-promise that you'll never lie
Ooh ooh oh

Make me a ring out of clover flowers
Sit in a teacup, spin for hours
I'm official, I know I'm official
Got a badge to your club and
One has initials
You become King Kong
You're King Kong
You grow up so strong
You're so strong
But I wannna stay young
Yeah, I wanna stay young with you
Yeah, I wanna stay young
Yeah, I wanna stay young with you
Wanna stay young
I wanna stay young with you
Wanna stay young
I wanna stay young

I wanna be a kid with you
Talk slow on a school night
And you can disregard my virgin ears and say what you like
You want to win me over now
Impress me like a school fight
And I triple-dog dare ya
To pinky-promise that you'll never lie
Ooh ooh oh

"Smoke Signals"

I went with you up to
The place you grew up in
We spent a week in the cold
Just long enough to
"Walden" it with you
Any longer, it would have got old
Singing "Ace of Spades" when Lemmy died
But nothing's changed, L.A.'s all right
Sleeping in my bed again, and getting in my head
And then walk around the reservoir

You, you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach

One of your eyes is
Always half-shut
Something happened when you were a kid
I didn't know you then
And I'll never understand
Why it feels like I did
"How Soon Is Now" in an '80s sedan
You slept inside of it because your dad
Lived in a campground in the back of a van
You said that song will creep you out until you're dead

And you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach

I want to live at
The Holiday Inn
Where somebody else makes the bed
We'll watch TV while
The lights on the street
Put all the stars to death
It's been on my mind since Bowie died
Just checking out to hide from life
And all of our problems, I'm gonna solve 'em
With you riding shot-gun, speeding, 'cause fuck the cops

And you, you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach

I buried a hatchet
It's coming up lavender
The future's unwritten
The past is a corridor
I'm at the exit looking back through the hall
You are anonymous
I am a concrete wall

"Motion Sickness"

I hate you for what you did
And I miss you like a little kid
I faked it every time but that's alright
I can hardly feel anything
I hardly feel anything at all

You gave me fifteen hundred
To see your hypnotherapist
I only went one time, you let it slide
Fell on hard times a year ago
Was hoping you would let it go and you did

I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out

I'm on the outside looking through
You're throwing rocks around your room
And while you're bleeding on your back in the glass
I'll be glad that I made it out
And sorry that it all went down like it did

I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out

And why do you sing with an English accent
I guess it's too late to change it now
You know I'm never gonna let you have it
But I will try to drown you out

You said when you met me you were bored
You said when you met me you were bored
And you you were in a band when I was born

I have emotional motion sickness
I try to stay clean and live without
And I want to know what would happen
If I surrender to the sound
Surrender to the sound

"Funeral"

I'm singing at a funeral tomorrow
For a kid a year older than me
And I've been talking to his dad, it makes me so sad
When I think too much about it I can't breathe

And I have this dream where I'm screaming underwater
While my friends are all waving from the shore
And I don't need you to tell me what that means
I don't believe in that stuff anymore

Jesus Christ, I'm so blue all the time
And that's just how I feel
Always have and I always will
I always have and always will

I have a friend I call
When I've bored myself to tears
And we talk until we think we might just kill ourselves
But then we laugh until it disappears

And last night I blacked out in my car
And I woke up in my childhood bed
Wishing I was someone else, feeling sorry for myself
When I remembered someone's kid is dead

Jesus Christ, I'm so blue all the time
And that's just how I feel
Always have and I always will
I always have and always will

And it's 4 AM, again
And I'm doing nothing
Again

"Demi Moore"

Take a dirty picture, babe
I can't sleep and I miss your face
In my hands and in my knees
Tell me what you wanna do to me
Tell me what you'll do, please

I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone anymore

You got quiet on the other line
Said the sun was coming up
And I laughed until I couldn't breathe
Now I'm too tired to go to sleep
Now I can't breathe, and I can't sleep

I don't wanna be stoned
I don't wanna be stoned anymore

Don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna be alone anymore

I could feel alone
I could, I got a good feeling
It doesn't happen very often

"Scott Street"

Walking Scott Street, feeling like a stranger
With an open heart, open container
I've got a stack of mail and a tall can
It's a shower beer it's a payment plan

There's helicopters over my head
Every night when I go to bed
Spending money and I earned it
When I'm lonely, that's when I'll burn it

Do you feel ashamed
When you hear my name

I asked you "How is your sister
I heard she got her degree"
And I said, "That makes me feel old"
He said, "What does that make me"

I asked you "How is playing drums"
You said it's too much shit to carry
"And what about the band"
You said they're all getting married

Do you feel ashamed
When you hear my name

Anyway, don't be a stranger
Anyway, don't be a stranger
Don't be a stranger

"Killer"

Sometimes I think I'm a killer
Scared you in your house
Even scared myself by talking
About Dahmer on your couch

But I can't sleep next to a body
Even harmless in death
Plus I'm pretty sure I'd miss you
And faking sleep to count your breath

Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you
Is there nothing left to do for us
I am sick of the chase
But I'm hungry for blood
And there's nothing I can do

But when I'm sick and tired
When my mind is barely there
When a machine keeps me alive
And I'm losing all my hair

I hope you kiss my rotten head
And pull the plug
Know that I've burned every playlist
And given all my love

Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you
I know there's something waiting for us
I am sick of the chase
But I'm stupid in love
And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can do

"Georgia"

Georgia, Georgia I love your son
When he gets older, he might be the one
He might be the one
Georgia, Georgia he has beautiful bones
And he never lies or picks up his phone

Sometimes in the pouring rain
He'll fall in the mud and get back up again
And if you find me
Will you know me
Will you take me
Or will you fall

Here is my day plan, my new machine
He is a fine new addition, so young and so clean
So young and so clean
He came up through the water without a sound
With my back to the shoreline, I dreamt that he drowned
I dreamt that he drowned

Sometimes when he looks at me
I know that he needs you, you're all that he sees
And if I had breathed you
Will it kill me
Will you have me
Or watch me fall
If I had fixed you
Will you hate me
Would you fuck this
And let us fall

"Chelsea"

For a chemical imbalance, you sure know how to ride a train
Your revolution is a deathbed, and the music is your maid
When someone comes a knocking with a needle on a tray
Only your lonesome lies beside you
For you told me not to stay
You are somebody's baby, some mother held you near
No it's not important, they're just pretty words, my dear
There is no distraction that can make me disappear
No there's nothing that won't remind you
I will always be right here

And you spit the blood back, spit the blood back
Baby, I'm amazed that you're alright
Oh, so long prison boy, I won't be home with you tonight

We're both very sick, our muscles all worn down
It's as if we are one-hundredno, I won't still be around
Because I've fallen, yes I've fallen right into the love I found
Long before I reach one-hundred
I'll have fallen to the ground
And for generations
Their romances make us more
It's much less than than ever was before, the Chelsea and the floor
Make us stand before the masses like two speakers for the poor
When there was no revolution
Nothing we were fighting for

And you spit the blood back, spit the blood back
Baby, I'm amazed that you're alright
Oh, so long prison boy, I won't be home
I won't be home
I won't be home with you tonight

And you can call the service bell
When we stay at the Chelsea hotel
And I'll stay out of my own head

Oh, so long prison boy, I won't be home
I won't be home
I won't be home with you tonight

"Would You Rather"

Playing would you rather
When it comes to fire
You always say that you'd prefer to drown
You were still in the ambulance
When the cop suggested
You're the one who tried to burn it down

Come to find out
I'm a can on a string, you're on the end
We find our way out
Of a suicide pact of our family and friends
In the background I'll be waiting

We have the same face
I laid awake
As someone shoved you up against a wall
Quarantined in a bad dream
He's half the man
And you're twice as tall

Come to find out
I'm a can on a string, you're on the end
We find our way out
Of a suicide pact of our family and friends
In the background I'll be waiting

Next time I see you you'll show me
A hundred different ways to say the same things

Come to find out
I'm a can on a string, you're on the end
We find our way out
Of a suicide pact of our family and friends
And when you touch down I'll be waving

"You Missed My Heart"

Broke into her house, saw her sitting there
Drinking coke and whiskey in her bra and underwear
Saw him in the kitchen, hanging up the phone
I asked him nicely once to pack his things and go

He gave her a reassuring look, said he wouldn't leave
But I asked him one more time, this time pulled out my shiv
Struck him in the back and I pulled it out slow
And I watched him fall down, and as the morning sun rose
He looked at me and said

"You missed my heart, you missed my heart
You got me good, I knew you would
But you missed my heart, you missed my heart"
Were his last words before he died

Looking out the window, up at the blue sky
Listening to her scream, listening to her cry
A feeling of relief came over my soul
I couldn't take it any longer and I lost control

I chased her up the stairs and I pinned her to the ground
And underneath her whimpering I could hear the sirens sound
I rattled off a list of all the things I missed
Like going to the movies with her and the way she kissed me

Driving into downtown Wheeling, showing her off
Backyard barbecues and reunions in the park
I said I missed her skin and when started laughing
And while I clenched down on her wrist, she said "that's quite a list
But there's one thing you missed

"You missed my heart, you missed my heart
That's quite a list, but what you really missed
You missed my heart, you missed my heart
That's quite a list, but what you really missed"

Running through the parking lot, running through the fields
Policemen on my back, something hit my skull and cracked
They dragged me off to jail, set a million dollar bail
Where I tried to tie a noose, but I failed and I broke loose

I went racing through the prison yard, shot down by a tower guard
He got me in the shins, and he got me in the arms
They strapped me in the gurney, took me off to the infirmary
Where the priest read my last rites
And just before, everything went dark

I said "He missed my heart, he missed my heart
He got me good, I knew he would
But he missed my heart, he missed my heart"
And just before, everything went dark

The most poetic dream came flowing like the sea
Laying there my lifeblood draining out of me
A childhood scene then, sky moon beams
Fishing with my friends sitting in the wild reeds

Watching the Ohio river flow at night
Waiting for the bullhead catfishes to bite
Downriver from the Moundsville prison graveyard...

"It'll All Work Out"

She wore faded jeans and soft black leather
She had eyes so blue they looked like weather
When she needed me I wasn't around
That's the way it goes, it'll all work out

There were times apart and times together
I was pledged to her for worse or better
When it mattered most I let her down
That's the way it goes, it'll all work out

It'll all work out eventually
Better off with him than here with me

Now the wind is high and the rain is heavy
The water's rising in the levee
Still I think of her when the sun goes down
Never goes away, but it all works out
Never goes away, but it all works out

"Garden Song"

Someday I'm gonna live
In your house up on the hill
And when your skinhead neighbor goes missing
I'll plant a garden in the yard then
They're gluing roses on a flatbed
You should see it, I mean thousands
I grew up here till it all went up in flames
Except the notches in the doorframe

I don't know when you got taller
See our reflection in the water
Off a bridge at the Huntington
I hopped the fence when I was seventeen
Then I knew what I wanted

And when I grow up, I'm gonna look up
From my phone and see my life
And it's gonna be just like my recurring dream
I'm at the movies
I don't remember what I'm seeing
The screen turns into a tidal wave
Then it's a dorm room, like a hedge maze
And when I find you
You touch my leg and I insist
But I wake up before we do it

I don't know how, but I'm taller
It must be something in the water
Everything's growing in our garden
You don't have to know that it's haunted
The doctor put her hands over my liver
She told me my resentment's getting smaller
No, I'm not afraid of hard work
I get everything I want
I have everything I wanted

"Kyoto"

Day off in Kyoto, got bored at the temple
Looked around at the 7-11
The band took the speed train, went to the arcade
I wanted to go but I didn't
You called me from a payphone, they still got pay phones
It costs a dollar a minute
To tell me you're getting sober and you wrote me a letter
But I don't have to read it

I'm gonna kill you
If you don't beat me to it
Dreaming through Tokyo skies
I wanted to see the world
Then I flew over the ocean
And I changed my mind

Sunset's been a freak show
On the weekend so I've been driving out to the suburbs
To park at the Goodwill and stare at the chem trails
With my little brother
He said you called on his birthday
You were off by like ten days
But you get a few points for trying
Remember getting the truck fixed when you let us drive it
25 felt like flying

I don't forgive you
But please don't hold me to it
Born under Scorpio skies
I wanted to see the world
Through your eyes until it happened
Then I changed my mind

Guess I lied
I'm a liar
Who lies
'Cause I'm a liar

"Punisher"

When the speed kicks in
I go to the store for nothing
And walk right by
The house where you lived with Snow White
I wonder if she ever thought
The storybook tiles on the roof were too much
But from the window, it's not a bad show
If your favorite thing's Dianetics or stucco

The drugstores are open all night
The only real reason I moved to the east side
I love a good place to hide in plain sight

What if I told you
I feel like I know you
But we never met

And here, everyone knows you're the way to my heart
Hear so many stories of you at the bar
Most times, alone, and some, looking your worst
But never not sweet to the trust funds and punishers

Man, I wish that I could say the same
I swear I'm not angry, that's just my face
A copycat killer with a chemical cut
Either I'm careless or I wanna get caught
Who I'm not

What if I told you
I feel like I know you
But we never met
It's for the best

I can't open my mouth and forget how to talk
'Cause even if I could
Wouldn't know where to start
Wouldn't know when to stop

"Halloween"

I hate living by the hospital
The sirens go all night
I used to joke that if they woke you up
Somebody better be dying
Sick of the questions I keep asking you
They make you live in the past
But I can count on you to tell me the truth
When you've been drinking and you're wearing a mask

Baby, it's Halloween
We can be anything
Come on, man
We can be anything

Always surprised what I'd do for love
Some things I'd never expect
They killed a fan down by the stadium
Was only visiting, they beat him to death

Baby, it's Halloween
We can be anything
Come on, man
We can be anything

Baby, it's Halloween
There's a last time for everything
Come on, man
We can be anything

Whatever you want
I'll be whatever you want
Whatever you want
Be whatever you want
I'll be whatever you want
(Whatever you want)
I'll be whatever you want
(Whatever you want)
(Whatever you want)

"Chinese Satellite"

I've been running around in circles
Pretending to be myself
Why would somebody do this on purpose
When they could do something else
Drowning out the morning birds
With the same three songs over and over
I wish I wrote it, but I didn't so I learn the words
Hum along 'til the feeling's gone forever

Took a tour to see the stars
But they weren't out tonight
So I wished hard on a Chinese satellite
I want to believe
Instead I look at the sky and I feel nothing
You know I hate to be alone
I want to be wrong

You were screamin' at the Evangelicals
They were screamin' right back from what I remember
When you said I will never be your vegetable
Because I think when you're gone it's forever
But you know I'd stand on the corner
Embarrassed with a picket sign
If it meant I would see you
When I die

Sometimes when I can't sleep
It's just a matter of time before I'm hearing things
Swore I could feel you through the walls
But that's impossible
I want to believe
That if I go outside I'll see a tractor beam
Coming to take me to where I'm from
I want to go home

"Moon Song"

You asked to walk me home
But I had to carry you
And you pushed me in
Now my feet can't touch the bottom of you

You couldn't have, you couldn't have
Stuck your tongue down the throat of somebody
Who loves you more
I will wait for the next time you want me
Like a dog with a bird at your door

We hate Tears in Heaven
But it's sad his baby died
We fought about John Lennon
Until I cried
Then I went to bed upset

Now I'm dreaming
And you're singing at my birthday
I've never seen you smiling so big
It's nautical themed
And there's something I'm supposed to say
Can't for the life of me remember what it is

And if I could give you the moon
I would give you the moon

You are sick, and you're married
And you might be dying
But you're holding me like water in your hands
When you saw the dead little bird, you started crying
But you know the killer doesn't understand

"Savior Complex"

Emotional affair
Overly sincere
Smoking in the car, windows up
Crocodile tears, run the tap 'til it's clear
Drift off on the floor
I drag you to the shore
Sweating through the sheets
You're gonna drown in your sleep for sure

Wake up and start a big fire
In our one room apartment
But I'm too tired
To have a pissing contest
All the bad dreams that you hide
Show me yours, I'll show you mine

Call me when you land
I'll drive around again
One hand on the wheel, one in your mouth
Turn me on and turn me down

Baby, you're a vampire
You want blood and I promised
I'm a bad liar
With a savior complex
All the skeletons you hide
Show me yours and I'll show you mine

All the bad dreams that you hide
Show me yours

"I See You"
(ICU)

Laying down on the lawn
I'm tired of trying to get in the house
I'm thinking out loud
I've been playing dead
My whole life
And I get this feeling whenever I feel good
It'll be the last time

But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you

If you're a work of art
I'm standing too close
I can see the brush strokes
I hate your mom
I hate it when she opens her mouth
It's amazing to me how much you can say
When you don't know what you're talking about

But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you

I used to light you up
Now I can't even get you to play the drums
'Cause I don't know what I want
Until I fuck it up

But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something

I'll climb through the window again
But right now it feels good not to stand
Then I'll leave it wide open
Let the dystopian morning light pour in

"Graceland Too"

No longer a danger to herself or others
She made up her mind and laced up her shoes
Yelled down the hall but nobody answered
So she walked outside without an excuse

She could do anything she wants to
She could do whatever she wants to do
She could go home, but she's not going to

So she picks a direction, it's ninety in Memphis
Turns up the music so thoughts don't intrude
Predictably winds up thinking of Elvis
And wonders if he believed songs could come true

I'm asking for it if they do
Doesn't know what she wants
Or what she's gonna do
A rebel without a clue

So we spent what was left of our serotonin
To chew on our cheeks and stare at the moon
Said she knows she'll live through it to get to this moment
Ate a sleeve of saltines on my floor and I knew that

I would do anything you want me to
I would do anything for you
I would do anything
I would do anything
Whatever you want me to do, I will do

Whatever she wants
Whatever she wants
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
I would do anything (Whatever you want)
I would do anything (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)

"I Know The End"

Somewhere in Germany, but I can't place it
Man, I hate this part of Texas
Close my eyes, fantasize
Three clicks and I'm home
When I get back, I'll lay around
Then I'll get up and lay back down
Romanticize a quiet life
There's no place like my room

But you had to go, I know, I know, I know
Like a wave that crashed and melted on the shore
Not even the burnouts are out here anymore
And you had to go, I know, I know, I know

Out in the park, we watch the sunset
Talkin' on a rusty swing set
After a while, you went quiet
And I got mean
I'm always pushin' you away from me
But you come back with gravity
And when I call, you come home
A bird in your teeth

So, I gotta go, I know, I know, I know
When the sirens sound, you'll hide under the floor
But I'm not gonna go down with my hometown in a tornado
I'm gonna chase it, I know, I know, I know
I gotta go now, I know, I know, I know

Drivin' out into the sun
Let the ultraviolet cover me up
Went looking for a creation myth
Ended up with a pair of cracked lips
Windows down, scream along
To some America First rap-country song
A slaughterhouse, an outlet mall
Slot machines, fear of God
Windows down, heater on
Big bolt of lightning hanging low
Over the coast, everyone's convinced
It's a government drone or an alien spaceship
Either way, we're not alone
I'll find a new place to be from
A haunted house with a picket fence
To float around and ghost my friends
No, I'm not afraid to disappear
The billboard said "The End Is Near"
I turned around, there was nothing there
Yeah, I guess the end is here

The end is here
The end is here
The end is here
The end is

"If We Make It Through December"

If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be all right, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine

Got laid off at the factory
And their timing is not the greatest in the world
Heaven knows I've been working hard
Wanted Christmas to be right for my girl
I don't mean to hate December
It's meant to be the happy time of year
And my little girl don't understand
Why we can't afford no Christmas gear

If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be all right, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine

"7 O'Clock News  Silent Night"

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

"Christmas Song"

Comin' back from the country
For the good food and lousy beer
This winter's so dry and the dirt road so dusty
At the lightest fall of rain, the bacteria bloom

You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it

Tethered to a table with that happy holiday crowd
And it's anchors aweigh
Looks like smooth sailin'
But the merest hint of waves could capsize you

You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it

The desire for annihilation
Is as common as it is unkind
And it's hard to recognize the situation
When you're desperately tryin' to have a good time

You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it

Yeah, it's Christmas
So no one can fix it

"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Next year all our troubles will be miles away

Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us, once more

Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now

"Coming Down"

I miss the drip in the back of my throat
Sometimes I miss my bloody nose
Two heads underwater, together we drowned
But nothing feels better when you're coming down
Nothing feels better when you're coming down

There's nothing that I won't believe
Waves are crashing over me
When a beautiful voice makes an awful sound
Well, nothing feels worse when you're coming down
Nothing feels worse when you're coming down

He said, "I need air, I need space"
One of us will die in this place
I see the fire through these clouds
I'll never have to feel it if I never come down
Never have to feel it if I never come down
Never have to feel it if I never come down

No mirrors on the table
No cab to the Chelsea Hotel
When it's freezing cold and I'm not able to tell

I see the rooftops disappear
How did I end up down here
Am I falling asleep or blacking out
Need you here if I ever come down
Need you here if I ever come down

It's the first time in months I've slept a whole night
You never once left my bedside
But don't you worry about me now
Just hold my hand and lay me down
Hold my hand and lay me down
Hold my hand and lay me down
Nothing feels better when you're coming down

"Sidelines"

I'm not afraid of anything at all
Not dying in a fire, not being broke again
I'm not afraid of living on a fault line
'Cause nothing ever shakes me, nothing makes me cry

Not a plane going down
In the ocean and drowning

Watched the world from the sidelines
Had nothing to prove
Till you came into my life
Gave me something to lose
Now I know what it feels like
To want to go outside
Like the shape of my outline

I'm not afraid of going back to school
I gave it up the first time, but I'll try again
I'm not afraid of getting older
Used to fetishize myself
Now I'm talking to my house plants

Not of being alone
In a room full of people

Watching the world from the sidelines
Had nothing to prove
Till you came into my life
Gave me something to lose
Now I know what it feels like
To want to go outside
Like the shape of my outline

And I used to think
You could hear the ocean in a seashell
What a childish thing

"Waiting Room"

If you were a teacher, I would fail your class
Take it over and over til you noticed me
If you were a waiting room, I would never see a doctor
I would sit there with my first aid kit and bleed

I want to be the power ballad that lifts you up and hold you down
I wanna be the broken love song that feeds your misery
And I can wish all I want, but it won't bring us together
Plus I know whatever happens to me
I know it's for the better

When broken bodies are washed ashore
Who am I to ask for more, more, more
But you're breathing in my open mouth
You're the gun in my lips that will blow my brains out

I want to make you drive all night just because I said maybe you should come over
I want to make you fall in love as hard as my poor parents teenage daughter
She'll be the best you ever had if you let her

I know it's for the better...

"Whatever"

It's that teenage feeling, got me staying in bed
There is nothing on my mind but water in my head
It's got me falling for just anyone, at least thinking I did
And it leaves me hanging on like some idiot kid

But I knew I had it coming
Well I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming

Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da dum

It's that teenage sickness keeping me up all night
It's got me climbing up the walls just to pick a good fight
I don't want to be so desperate, oh what have I done
Oh but I can't be alone, I'll take anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone

This was a test, this was a test
This was a test, this was a test
This was a test, this was a test yeah baby
This, this was a test yeah baby
This, this was a test yeah baby

Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da dum

I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming

Whoa this was a test, this was a test
This was a test, this was a test
This was a test

"Wilt"

I've got a surgeon's precision and a drunk man's hand
They say I've stopped growin', so I do what I can
Nothin' ever changes but the cigarette brand
But don't panic, it's just routine
Don't panic, this is just routine

You've got roses on the brain, and I'm all wilt
You've got snowflakes in your veins, and I'm all melt
You don't got blame on your breath
God bless, but all I taste is guilt
Ooh

Misery will bury you
I'm so sorry if I'm scarin' you
What was I supposed to do
As opposed to lovin' you

I've got a surgeon's hand and a drunk man's passion
Totally limbless and I'm ready for action
Nothin' ever changes but the taste of tobacco
But don't panic, it's just routine
Don't panic, this is just routine

You've got roses on the brain, and I'm all wilt
You've got snowflakes in your veins, and I'm all melt
You don't got blame on your breath
God bless, but all I taste is guilt
Ooh

Misery will bury you
I'm so sorry if I'm scarin' you
What was I supposed to do
As opposed to lovin' you

You've got roses the brain, and I'm all wilt

But misery will bury you
I'm so sorry if I'm scarin' you
What was I supposed to do
As opposed to lovin' you

"Turned Around"

I'm not crazy
I'm just nervous
I'm on my toes
At the edge of the world
And my mind feels like an empty room
The inside black as coal
And it hurts to want something so bad
That you lose all self control

And I know
How you are sometimes
And I know
You're just a little turned around

Yeah, I can feel it getting late
And my body is getting tired
But there's no point leaving before they game
When my mind feels so wired
Yeah, you took me to this station and you showed me every sign
No one else could understand
You know I'm lost but I'll be fine

And you know
How I am sometimes
And you know
I'm just a little turned around

We had it all planned out
It's so hard to watch it burn
Burn...
Watch it burn

Watch it burn

"Steamroller"

I am tired of being sad
I feel it when I wake up
And it just stays bad
It hits me like a sickness
Or a steamroller
Makes me wanna lay down
And get run over

But then I see you
Always smiling
Makes me wanna touch you
Keep from dying

You're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
You're the feeling I get
When I'm feeling fine

Part of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won't fall unless you ask me to

We talk for hours
Until finally
Sleep takes over
The amphetamines

In the darkness
I feel your fingers
They don't touch me
But there's a danger

You're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
Your the feeling I get
When I'm feeling fine

Part of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won't fall unless you ask me

You're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
You're the feeling I get
When I'm feeling fine

Part of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won't fall unless you ask me"Bravado"

All my life
I've been fighting a war
I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you
My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to
This will not do

'Cause I was raised up
To be admired to be noticed
But when you're withdrawn it's the closest thing
To assault when all eyes are on you
This will not do

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm faking glory
Lick my lips toss my hair
And turn the smile on
And the story's brand-new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado

It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipsed, whoa
And I can tell you that when the lights come on I'll be ready for this

It's in your bloodstream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scale without thinking of size

I was frightened of every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me

But I learnt not to want
The quiet of the room with no one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval, the things that make me go

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipsed, whoa
And I can tell you that when the lights come on I'll be ready for this

It's in your blood stream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scale without thinking of size

I was frightened of every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me

But I learnt not to want
The quiet of the room with no one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval, the things that make me go

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

"Royals"

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
We didn't come from money

But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

Ooh ooh oh
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen
Ooh ooh oh
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

"Million Dollar Bills"

There's nothing I want
But money and time
Million dollar bills
And the tick-tick-tick-tick
There's nothing more cruel
Than only nine lives
Unlimited spines
Would do the trick-trick-trick-trick

We could leave the house, leave the party, let the people know
Go drown the colours of our minds and watch the cars go

There's nothing as fun
As coming untied
And running with the kids
In the park-park-park-park
There's nothing that's hurt
Like letting you go
It's like a bird
Eyes
In the dark-dark-dark-dark

We could leave the house, lead the party, let the people know
Go drown the colours of our minds and watch the cars go
It's not about just bein' out with the right people
'Cause we can get in trouble just by going free-flow

And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know

"The Love Club"

I'm in a clique but I want out
It's not the same as when I was punched
In the old days, there was enough
The card games and knees with the bitter salt of blood
I was in, but I want out
My mother's love is choking me
I'm sick of words that hang above my head
"What about the kid" It's time the kid got free

Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

I joined the club and it's all on
There are fights for being my best friend
And the girls get their claws out
There's something about hanging out with the wicked kids
Take the pill, make it too real
The other day I forgot my old address
I'm sitting pretty on the throne
There's nothing more I want
Except to be alone

Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

(For the love club)
(For the love club)
(For the love club)

Your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go
So drop your chin and take yourself back home
And roll out your maps and papers
Find out your hiding places again
The only problem that I got with the club
Is how you're severed from the people
Who watched you grow up
When you're a member
Go on your great adventure again
And we'll be waiting at the end

Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

(For the love club)
(For the love club)
(For the love club)
(For the love club)

"Biting Down"

It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down

Skip a hit, don't make a sound
(It feels better biting down)
Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown
(It feels better biting down)
Listen to the beats resound
(It feels better biting down)
It feels better biting down
(It feels better biting down)

It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down

Skip a hit, don't make a sound
(It feels better biting down)
Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown
(It feels better biting down)
Listen to the beats resound
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down

The electronics of your heart
See how fast they fall apart
(It feels better biting down)
The electronics of your heart
See how fast they fall apart
(It feels better biting down)
It feels better biting down

Skip a hit, don't make a sound
(It feels better biting down)

"Tennis Court"

Don't you think that it's boring how people talk
Making smart with their words again, well I'm bored
Because I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
Never not chasing a million things I want
And I am only as young as the minute is full of it
Getting pumped up on the little bright things I bought
But I know they'll never own me
(Yeah)

Baby be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah)

Pretty soon I'll be getting on my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
But my head's filling up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again, when I'm known
And my boys trip me up with their heads again, loving them
Everything's cool when we're all in line for the throne
But I know it's not forever
(Yeah)

Baby be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah)

It looked alright in the pictures (yeah)

Getting caught's half of the trip though, isn't it
I fall apart with all my heart (yeah)
And you could watch from your window (yeah)
[Laughs]
And you can watch from your window

Baby be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah)

"400 Lux"

We're never done with killing time
Can I kill it with you
'Til the veins run red and blue
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do
Let me kill it with you

You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow, but we're brave

And I like you
I love these roads where the houses don't change (and I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say (and I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway (and I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed

Now we're wearing long sleeves and the heating comes on
(You buy me orange juice)
We're getting good at this
Dreams of clean teeth
I can tell that you're tired
But you keep the car on
While you're waiting out front

You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow, but we're brave

And I like you
I love these roads where the houses don't change (and I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say (and I like you)

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh

And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
We didn't come from money

But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

Ooh ooh oh
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen
Ooh ooh oh
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

"Ribs"

The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy getting old

We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good, how you wish it would be all the time

The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy getting old

The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy getting old

This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary getting old

We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good, how you wish it would be all the time

This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
Feels so scary getting old

This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
Feels so scary getting old

I want them back (I want them back)
The minds we had (the minds we had)
How all the thoughts (how all the thoughts)
Moved 'round our heads (moved 'round our heads)

I want them back (I want them back)
The minds we had (the minds we had)
It's not enough to feel the lack (I want them back, I want them back)
I want 'em

You're the only friend I need (you're the only friend I need)
Sharing beds like little kids (sharing beds like little kids)
And laughing 'til our ribs get tough (and laughing 'til our ribs get tough)
But that will never be enough (but that will never be enough)

You're the only friend I need (you're the only friend I need)

"Buzzcut Season"

I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
(I remember when your head caught flame)
Well, you laughed, baby, it's OK
It's buzzcut season, anyway
(Well, you laughed, baby, it's OK)

Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good

We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
People should see how we're living
(We ride the bus with the knees pulled in)
Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays)

The men up on the news
They try to tell us all that we will lose
But it's so easy in this blue
Where everything is good

And I'll never go home again
(Place the call, feel it start)
Favorite friend
(And nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
We're all the things that we do for fun
(And I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along
(Make-believe, it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you

Cola with the burnt-out taste
I'm the one you tell your fears to
There'll never be enough of us

Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good

And I'll never go home again
(Place the call, feel it start)
Favorite friend
(And nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
We're all the things that we do for fun
(And I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along
(Make-believe, it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you

"Team"

Wait till you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon Your Greatness and she'll
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out

Call all the ladies out
They're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother
While he glows through the room

Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes, as well
Even the comatose
They don't dance and tell

We live in cities you'll never see on-screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there

So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet
But it wasn't my fault
And everyone's competing
For a love they won't receive
'Cause what this palace wants is release

We live in cities you'll never see on-screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
I'm kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care
So there

We live in cities you'll never see on-screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

We're on each other's team
And you know, we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know, and you know, and you know

"Glory And Gore"

There's a humming in the restless summer air
And we're slipping off the course that we prepared
But in all chaos, there is calculation
Dropping glasses just to hear them break
You've been drinking like the world was gonna end (it didn't)
Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (go figure)
It's clear that someone's gotta go
We mean it but I promise we're not mean

And the cry goes out
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out 
Now we're in the ring
And we're coming for blood

(Oh Oh)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But we're the gladiators (Oh Oh)
Everyone a rager (oh-oh)
But secretly they're saviors
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines (Oh Oh)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But victory's contagious

Delicate in every way but one (the swordplay)
God knows we like archaic kinds of fun (the old way)
Chance is the only game I play with, baby
We let our battles choose us

And the cry goes out
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out 
Now we're in the ring
And we're coming for blood

(Oh Oh)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But we're the gladiators (Oh Oh)
Everyone a rager (oh-oh)
But secretly they're saviors
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines (Oh Oh)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But victory's contagious

No-one round here's good at keeping their eyes closed
The sun's starting to light up when we're walking home
Tired little laughs, gold-lie promises we'll always win at this
I don't ever think about death
It's alright if you do, it's fine
We gladiate but I guess we're really fighting ourselves
Roughing up our minds so we're ready when the kill time comes
Wide awake in bed, words in my brain, 
"Secretly you love this do you even wanna go free"
Let me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means

(Oh Oh)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But we're the gladiators (Oh Oh)
Everyone a rager (oh-oh)
But secretly they're saviors
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines (Oh Oh)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But victory's contagious

"Still Sane"

Today is my birthday, and I'm riding high
Hair is dripping, hiding that I'm terrified
But this is summer, playing dumber than in fall

Everything I say falls right back
Into everything I'm not
In the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet

Riding around on the bikes, we're still sane
I won't be her, tripping over on-stage
Hey, it's all cool, I still like hotels, but I think that'll change
Still like hotels, and my newfound fame
Hey, promise I can stay good

(Everything feels right)
I'm little, but I'm coming for the crown
I'm little, but I'm coming for you
(Chase paper, get by)
I'm little but I'm coming for the title
Held by everyone who's up

All work and no play
Never made me lose it
All business all day
Keeps me up a level
All work and no play
Keeps me on the new shit, yeah

All work and no play
Let me count the bruises
All business all day
Keeps me up a level
All work and no play
Lonely on that new shit, yeah, yeah

Only bad people live to see their likeness set in stone
Only bad people live to see their likeness set in stone
What does that make me

I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet

I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet

All work and no play
Never made me lose it
All business all day
Keeps me up a level

All work and no play
Keeps me on the new shit, yeah

"White Teeth Teens"

We wouldn't be seen dead here in the day
I guess you're lucky that it's dark now
And if I like it then we'll stay
Impress the empress, take a shot now

We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are up for it

I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this

If you want we'll help tonight to split its seams
Give the bruises out like gifts
You'll get the picture of your dreams
I won't be smiling
But the notes from my admirers
Fill the dashboard just the same

We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are up for it

I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop us when we're up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this

[Repeat in background]
And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could

I'll let you in on something big
I am not a white teeth teen
I tried to join but never did
The way they are, the way they seem is something else, it's in the blood
Their molars blinking like the lights, in the underpass where we all sit
And do nothing
And love it

[Repeat in background]
And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could

We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are out

"A World Alone"

That slow burn wait while it gets dark, bruising the sun
I feel grown up with you in your car, I know it's dumb

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

We've both got a million bad habits to kick, not sleeping is one
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip, I'm biting my tongue

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
People are talking, people are talking (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
People are talking, people are talking

Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone, world alone, we're alone

All my fake friends and all of their noise, complain about work
They're studying business, I study the floor, and you haven't stopped smoking all night
Maybe the Internet raised us, or maybe people are jerks
(People are talking, people are talking)
But not you
(People are talking, people are talking)

Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone, world alone, we're alone

All the double-edged people and schemes
They make a mess then go home and get clean
You're my best friend, and we're dancing in a world alone, a world alone, we're alone

I know we're not everlasting
We're a train wreck waiting to happen
One day the blood won't flow so gladly
One day we'll all get still
(People are talking, people are talking)
(People are talking, people are talking)
Get still
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
People are talking, people are talking (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
People are talking, people are talking
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
People are talking, people are talking (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
People are talking, people are talking

Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone, world alone, we're alone

All the double-edged people and schemes
They make a mess then go home and get clean
You're my best friend and we're dancing in a world alone, a world alone, we're alone

People are talking, people are talking
People are talking, people are talking
People are talking, people are talking
People are talking, people are talking

Let 'em talk

"Green Light"

I do my make-up in somebody else's car
We order different drinks at the same bars
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar
(Liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar)

Well, those great whites, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love, no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light-up floor
On the light-up floor

But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But, honey, I'll be seein' you 'ever I go
But, honey, I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

'Cause, honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

Sometimes I wake up in a different bedroom
I whisper things, the city sings them back to you

Well, those rumours, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love, no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light-up floor
On the light-up floor

But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But, honey, I'll be seein' you 'ever I go
But, honey, I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

'Cause, honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

Yeah, honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

"Sober"

Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
(When you get to my high, when you get to my)
Night, midnight

Oh, God, I'm clean out of air in my lungs
It's all gone
Played it so nonchalant
It's time we danced with the truth
Move alone with the truth
Ooh (hey)
We're sleeping through all the days
I'm acting like I don't see
Every ribbon you used to tie yourself to me

But my hips have missed your hips
So, let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me
Go astray with me
(Ah ha)

We're King and Queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober)
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care
But we care
(But what will we do when we're sober)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober)

Oh, God, I'm closing my teeth
Around this liquor-wet lime
Midnight, lose my mind
I know you're feeling it too
Can we keep up with the ruse
Ah ah (hey)
B-bodies all through my house
I know this story by heart
Jack and Jill get fucked up and possessive
When it get dark

But my hips have missed your hips
So, let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me
Go astray with me
(Ah ha)

We're King and Queen of the Weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober)
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care
But we care
(But what will we do when we're sober)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober)

Midnight, we're fading
'Til daylight, we're jaded
We know that it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with all the heartache
And the treason, the fantasies of leaving
But we know that, when it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with us
(Midnight, lose my mind, midnight, lose my mind)
Oh, dancing with us
(But what will we do when we're sober)
Oh, you'll be dancing with us
(Can you feel it Can you feel it)
Dancing with us, us
(But what will we do when we're sober)
Us

When you get to my high (midnight, lose my mind)
When you get to my (midnight, lose my mind)

"Homemade Dynamite"

A couple rebel Top Gun pilots
Flying with nowhere to be
Don't know you super well
But I think that you might be the same as me
Behave abnormally

Let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side
Tell you all my best lies
Yeah, awesome right
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side
Tell you all my best lies
Seeing me rolling, showing someone else love
Dancing with our shoes off
Know I think you're awesome, right

Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

Might get your friend to drive
But he can hardly see
We'll end up painted on the road
Red and chrome, all the broken glass sparkling
I guess we're partying

So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side
Tell you all my best lies
See me rolling, showing someone else love
Hands under your T-shirt
Know I think you're awesome, right

Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

Now you know it's really gonna blow (boo)

Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

"The Louvre"

Well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
Our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
Half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard
I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough
I overthink your p-punctuation use
Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do

A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame
All that you're doing
Can you hear the violence
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

Our thing progresses, I call and you come through
Blow all my friendships to sit in hell with you
But we're the greatest, they'll hang us in the Louvre
Down the back, but who cares Still the Louvre
Okay, I know that you are not my type (Still I fall)
I'm just the sucker who let you fill her mind (But what about love)
Nothing wrong with it, supernatural
Just move in close to me, closer, you'll feel it coasting

A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame
All that you're doing
Can you hear the violence
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

"Liability"

Go for it
One, two

Baby really hurt me
Crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please
But she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands
Play at romance, we slow dance
In the living room, but all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone
Stroking her cheek

They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for
E-a-na-na-na, everyone

The truth is I am a toy
That people enjoy
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting
Running through the night, but
Every perfect summer's
Eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own

They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for
E-a-na-na-na, everyone

They're gonna watch me
Disappear into the sun
You're all gonna watch me
Disappear into the sun

"Hard Feelings  Loveless"

[Hard Feelings]

Go back and tell it

Please, could you be tender
And I will sit close to you
Let's give it a minute before we admit that we're through
Guess this is the winter
Our bodies are young and blue
I'm at Jungle City, it's late and this song is for you

'Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us
Before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
Now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
Well, I guess I should go, yeah, I guess I should go

Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When sweet words and fevers
All leave us right here in the cold, oh, oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God, I wish I believed ya
When you told me this was my home, oh, oh

I light all the candles
Cut flowers for all my rooms
I care for myself the way I used to care about you
These days, we kiss and we keep busy
The waves come after midnight
I call from underwater
Why even try to get right
When you've outgrown a lover (Oh)
The whole world knows but you (Oh)
It's time to let go of this endless summer afternoon

Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When sweet words and fevers
All leave us right here in the cold, oh, oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God, I wish I believed ya
When you told me this was my home, oh, oh

Three years, loved you every single day
Made me weak, it was real for me, yeah, real for me
Now I'll fake it every single day
'Til I don't need fantasy, 'til I feel you leave
But I still remember everything
How we'd drift buying groceries, how you'd dance for me
I'll start letting go of little things
'Til I'm so far away from you, far away from you, yeah

"Sober II (Melodrama)"

You asked if I was feeling it, I'm psycho high
Know you won't remember in the morning when I speak my mind
Lights are on and they've gone home, but who am I
Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses
We told you this was melodrama
(Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)
Our only wish is melodrama
(Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)

And the terror and the horror
When we wonder why we bother, whoa, whoa
And the terror and the horror
God, I wonder why we bother, whoa, whoa
All the glamour and the trauma
And the fuckin' melodrama, whoa, whoa
All the gun fights and the lime lights
And the holy sick divine nights, whoa
(Holy sick divine nights, whoa)
They'll talk about us, all the lovers
How we kiss and kill each other, whoa
They'll talk about us, and discover
How we kissed and killed each other, whoa
(And we'll tell them)

We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offer
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offer
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offer
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offer

We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama

"Writer In The Dark"

Break the newsyou're walking out
To be a good man for someone else
Sorry I was never good like you
Stood on my chest and kept me down
Hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
Did my best to exist just for you

Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe

I still feel you, now and then
Slow like pseudo-ephedrine
When you see me, will you say I've changed
I ride the subway, read the signs
I let the seasons change my mind
I love it here since I've stopped needing you

Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe

I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe

"Supercut"

In my head
I play a supercut of us
All the magic we gave off
All the love we had and lost
And in my head
The visions never stop
These ribbons wrap me up
But when I reach for you
There's just a supercut

In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
We keep trying to talk about us
I'm someone you maybe might love
I'll be your quiet afternoon crush
Be your violent overnight rush
Make you crazy over my touch

But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh, it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us

So I fall
Into continents and cars
All the stages and the stars
I turn all of it
To just a supercut

'Cause in my head (In my head, I do everything right)
When you call (When you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours are the moments I play in the dark
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh

In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
We keep trying to talk about us
Slow motion, I'm watching our love
I'll be your quiet afternoon crush
Be your violent overnight rush
Make you crazy over my touch

But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh, it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh, it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us

'Cause in my head, in my head, I do everything right
When you call, I'll forgive and not fight
All the moments I play in the dark
Wild, fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh
'Cause in my head (In my head, I do everything right)
When you call (When you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours are the moments I play in the dark
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh
'Cause in my head (In my head, I do everything right)
When you call (When you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours are the moments I play in the dark
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh

In my head, I do everything right
In my head, I do everything right

"Liability (Reprise)"

I'm a liability, I'm a liability
Much for me
You're a little much for me, no, no, no, no
And what ya gonna do Whoa

All of the dreams that get harder
All of the things that I offer you, ay
And all of the shit that we harbour
Make all of the kids in the choirs sing, "Woo-hoo"
And maybe all this is the party
Maybe the tears and the highs we breathe, oh no
And maybe all this is the party
Maybe we just do it violently

But you're not what you thought you were
But you're not what you thought you were
(Liability) But you're not what you thought you were
(Much for me) But you're not what you thought you were
Leave

"Perfect Places"

Every night, I live and die
Feel the party to my bones
Watch the wasters blow the speakers
Spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
It's just another graceless night
I hate the headlines and the weather
I'm 19 and I'm on fire
But when we're dancing, I'm alright
It's just another graceless night

Are you lost enough
Have another drink, get lost in us
This is how we get notorious, oh
'Cause I don't know
If they keep tellin' me where to go
I'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh-oh-oh

Ch, ch

All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places

Every night, I live and die
Meet somebody, take 'em home
Let's kiss and then take off our clothes
It's just another graceless night

'Cause all of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places

All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places, anyway
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places, anyway
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places, anyway

"The Path"

Born in the year of OxyContin
Raised in the tall grass
Teen millionaire having nightmares from the camera flash
Now I'm alone on a windswept island
Caught in the complex divorce of the seasons
Won't take the call if it's the label or the radio
Ahh
Ahh

Arm in a cast at the museum gala
Fork in my purse to take home to my mother
Supermodels all dancing 'round a pharaoh's tomb

Now if you're looking for a savior, well that's not me
You need someone to take your pain for you
Well, that's not me
'Cause we're all broken and sad
Where are the dreams that we had
Can't find the dreams that we had
Ah, ah, ah
Let's hope the sun will show us the path
Let's hope the sun will show us the path
Ah, ah, ah
I just hope the sun will show us the path
Savior is not me
I just hope the sun will show us the path
Savior is not me
I just hope the sun will show us the path
Path, path

"Solar Power"

I hate the winter
Can't stand the cold
I tend to cancel all the plans
(So sorry, I can't make it)
But when the heat comes
Something takes a hold
Can I kick it
Yeah, I can

My cheeks in high color, overripe peaches
No shirt, no shoes, only my features
My boy behind me, he's taking pictures
Lead the boys and girls onto the beaches
Come one, come all, I'll tell you my secrets
I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus

Forget all of the tears
That you've cried
It's over (Over)
(Over, over, over)
It's a new state of mind
Are you coming, my baby

Acid green
Aquamarine
The girls are dancing
In the sand
And I throw my cellular device
In the water
Can you reach me
No, you can't (Aha)

My cheeks in high color, overripe peaches
No shirt, no shoes, only my features
My boy behind me, he's taking pictures
(He's taking pictures)
Lead the boys and girls onto the beaches
Come one, come all, I'll tell you my secrets
I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus

Turn it on
In a new kind of bright
It's solar (Solar)
(Solar, solar, solar)
Come on and let the bliss begin
Blink three times when you feel it kickin' in

That solar-olar
Olar power
Solar-olar
Olar power
Solar-olar
Olar power
Solar-olar
Olar power
Solar-olar
Olar power
Solar-olar
Olar power

"California"

Once upon a time in Hollywood when Carole called my name
I stood up, the room exploded and I knew that's it, I'll never be the same
That's when the doors swung open and a voice said, "We're glad you came"
Now I've spent thousands on you darling, all the hotels and the jets
And I'd pay it all again to have your golden body back in my bed
But I don't miss the poison arrows aimed directly at my head

Goodbye to all the bottles
All the models
Bye to the clouds in the skies that all hold no rain-
(Don't want that California love)
(Don't want that California love)
(Don't want that California love)

Once upon a time the Canyon Store was where my world began
All that mystery and beauty gleaned from desert flowers and gifted children
But it got hard to grow up with your cool hand around my neck
Now in my hometown, sunbathing
My girlfriends, and my baby
But every time I smell tequila, the garden grows up in my mind again

Goodbye to all the bottles
All the models
Bye to the kids in the lines for the new Supreme-
(Don't want that California love)
(Don't want that California love)
(Don't want that California love)
(Don't want that California love)
(Don't want that California love)
(Don't want that California love)

It's just a dream
It's just a dream
It's all just a dream
I wanna wake up, I wanna wake up

"Stoned At The Nail Salon"

Got a wishbone drying on the windowsill in my kitchen
Just in case I wake up and realise I've chosen wrong
I love this life that I have
The vine hanging over the door
And the dog who comes when I call
But I wonder sometimes what I'm missing

Well, my hot blood's been burning for so many summers now
It's time to cool it down
Wherever that leads

'Cause all the beautiful girls, they will fade like the roses
And all the times, they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again

Got a memory of waiting in your bed wearing only my earrings
We'd go dancing all over the landmines under our town
But the sun has to rise
When it does, we'll divide up the papers
Two former hell-raisers
I'm still crazy for you, babe

Well, my hot blood's been burning for so many summers now
It's time to cool it down
Wherever that leads

'Cause all the music you loved at sixteen, you'll grow out of
And all the times, they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybe I'm just
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again

Oh, make it good
Oh, make it good
I'd ride and I'd ride on the carousel
'Round and 'round forever if I could
But it's time to cool it down
Whatever that means

Spend all the evenings you can with the people who raised you
'Cause all the times they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again

"Fallen Fruit"

To the ones who came before us
All the golden ones who were lifted on a wing
We had no idea the dreams we had were far too big
Far too big

And we will walk together (We will walk)
Psychedelic garlands in our hair
Through the halls of splendour where the apple trees all grew
You'll leave us dancing on the fallen fruit
(The fallen fruit)
The fallen fruit (Ooh)
(The fallen fruit)

From the Nissan to the Phantom to the plane
We'll disappear in the cover of the rain
Took the great minds and the vapers
And a pocketful of seed
It's time for us to leave

And we will walk together (We will walk)
Psychedelic garlands in our hair
But how can I love what I know I am gonna lose
Don't make me choose

(The fallen fruit)
(The fallen fruit)
(The fallen fruit)

"Secrets From A Girl (Who's Seen It All)"

Dancing with my girls, only having two drinks then leaving
It's a funny thing, thought you'd never gain self-control
Guess it's been a while since you last said sorry
Crying in the dark at your best friends' parties
You've had enough, gotta turn the lights up, go home

Couldn't wait to turn fifteen
Then you blink and it's been ten years
Growing up a little at a time then all at once
Everybody wants the best for you
But you gotta want it for yourself
My love

You can take 'em if you want 'em, these are just
Secrets from a girl, who's seen it all
Secrets from a girl, who's seen it
Secrets from a girl
Secrets from a girl, who's seen it
Secrets from a girl (Secrets from a girl)
Secrets from a girl, who's seen it all

'Member all the hurt you would feel when you weren't desired
(Doing anything for more touch)
'Member what you thought was grief before you got the call
Baby girl, no one's gonna feel the pain for you
You're gonna love again, so just try staying open
And when the time comes, you'll fall
Yeah, when the time comes, you'll fall

Your dreams and inner visions, all your mystical ambitions
They won't let you down
Do your best to trust all the rays of light
Everybody wants the best for you
But you gotta want it for yourself
My love

Couldn't wait to turn fifteen, then you just go
(Whoosh)
Secrets from a girl, who's seen it all
Secrets from a girl, who's seen it
Secrets from a girl
Secrets from a girl, who's seen it
Secrets from a girl (Secrets from a girl)
Secrets from a girl, who's seen it all

Welcome to Sadness
The temperature is unbearable until you face it
Thank you for flying with Strange Airlines
I will be your tour guide today
Your emotional baggage can be picked up at Carousel Number 2
Please be careful so that it doesn't fall onto someone you love
When we've reached your final destination, I will leave you to it
You'll be fine
I'm just gonna show you in, and um you can stay as long as you need to get familiar with the feeling
And then when you're ready, I'll be outside, and we can go look at the sunrise by euphoria mixed with existential vertigo
Cool

"The Man With The Axe"

If I had to break it down, I'd say it's the way you love to dance
Moving the furniture when my back is turned
The flick of the lights and the world falls away
And your office job, and your silver hair
But our shapes in the dark are the reason I've stayed for all these years

I thought I was a genius
But now I'm twenty-two
And it's starting to feel like all I know how to do is
Put on a suit and take it away
With my fistful of tunes that it's painful to play
Fingernail worlds, like favourite seashells
They fill up my nights and then they float away

I've got hundreds of gowns, I've got paintings in frames
And a throat that fills with panic every festival day
Dutifully falling apart for the Princess of Norway

But you with your doll's lashes, your infinite T-shirts
I should've known when your favourite record was the same as my father's you'd take me down

I guess I'll always be this way
Swallowed up by the words and halfway to space
But there by the fire, you offered your hand
And as I took it, I loved you, the boy with the plan

You felled me clean as a pine
The man with the axe
And the look in his eyes

We've been through so many hard times, I'm writing a love song
For you, baby

"Dominoes"

I heard that you were doing yoga
With Uma Thurman's mother
Just outside of Woodstock
Now you're watering all the flowers
You planted with your new girlfriend
Outside on the rooftop

Just another phase you're rushing on through
Go all New Age, outrunning your blues

Fifty gleaming chances in a row
Then I watch you flick them down like dominoes
Must feel good being Mr. Start-Again

I know
Know a girl who knows a
Another girl who knows the woman that you hurt
It's strange to see you smoking marijuana
You used to do the most cocaine
Of anyone I'd ever met

Just another phase you're shooting on through
The whole world changes right around you
You get fifty gleaming chances in a row
And I watch you flick them down like dominoes
Must feel good being Mr. Start-Again
Yeah, it must feel good being Mr. Start-Again
Don't get up
Yeah, it must feel good being Mr. Start-Again

"Big Star"

Everyone knows that you're too good for me, don't they
I'm a cheater, I lie, and I'm shy
But you like to say hello to total strangers
Shivering pines and walls of colour
I can't believe I used to stay inside

But every perfect summer's gotta say goodnight
Now I watch you run through the amber light
I used to love the party, now I'm not alright
Drinking in the dark, take me home tonight

Baby, you're a big star
You're a big star
Wanna take your picture

I toss up if it's worth it now every time I get on a plane
I've got so much to tell you and not enough time to do it in

But every perfect summer's gotta take its flight
I'll still watch you run through the winter light
I used to love the party, now I'm not alright
Hope the honeybees make it home tonight

Baby, you're a big star
You're a big star
Wanna take your picture

'Til I die
'Til I die
'Til I die

"Leader Of A New Regime"

Wearing SPF 3000 for the ultraviolet rays
Made it to the island on the last of the outbound planes (Ah-ah)
Got a trunk full of Simone and Cline, and of course, my magazines
I'm gonna live out my days

Won't somebody, anybody, be the leader of a new regime
Free the keepers of the burnt-out scene another day
Lust and paranoia reign supreme
We need the leader of a new regime

"Mood Ring"

I'm tryna blow bubbles, but inside
Can't seem to fix my mood
Today it's as dark as my roots
If I, if I ever let them grow out (Ah-ah)
Now all of my oceans have riptides
Can't seem to find what's wrong
The whole world is letting me down
Don't you think the early 2000s seem so far away (Ay-ay-ay-ay)

Ladies, begin your sun salutations
Transcendental in your meditations (Love and light)
You can burn sage, and I'll cleanse the crystals
We can get high, but only if the wind blows (Blows just right)

I can't feel a thing
I keep looking at my mood ring
Tell me how I'm feeling
Floating away, floating away

I'm tryna get well from the inside
Plants and celebrity news, all the vitamins I consume
Let's fly somewhere eastern, they'll have what I need (They'll have what I need)
Let's go

Ladies, begin your sun salutations
Pluto in Scorpio generation (Love and light)
You can burn sage, and I'll cleanse the crystals
We can get high, but only if the wind blows (Blows just right, ri-ri-ri-right)

I can't feel a thing
I keep looking at my mood ring
Tell me how I'm feeling
Floating away, floating away
All the sad girls sing
We'll keep dancing 'til the mood rings
Tell us how we're feeling
Floating away, floating away

Take me to some kinda
Take me to some kinda
Take me to some kinda place (Anywhere)
Watch the sun set, look back on my life (Take me to some kinda)
I just wanna know, will it be alright (Take me to some kinda)
Take me to some kinda place (Anywhere)

"Oceanic Feeling"

It's a blue day
We could jump Bulli
When I hit that water
When it holds me
I think about my father
Doin' the same thing
When he was a boy
When he was a boy
It's a blue day
We could go fishing
You'll catch the big one
Ah

Slidin' the knife under the skin
Grateful for this offering
And all the livin' things under the sun
Under the sun

Little brother, I think you're an angel
I see your silver chain levitate
When you're kick-flipping
Baby boy, you're super cool
I know you're scared, so was I
But all will be revealed in time (Time, time)

Oh, look, the rays are in the bay now
Can you hear the waves and the cicadas all around
I can make anything real
Brain so hot, it's a summer body
Every day is blue and never cloudy
Don't look down
I can make anything real

In the future
If I have a daughter
Will she have my waist
Or my widow's peak
My dreamer's disposition or my wicked streak

Will she split a tab with her lover
And laugh at the stars like her mother
When she was a girl
When she was a girl

Now the cherry-black lipstick's gathering dust in a drawer
I don't need her anymore
'Cause I got this power
I just had to breathe (Breathe out, breathe out, breathe out, breathe out)
And tune in (Tune in, tune in, tune in, tune in)
I just had to breathe (Breathe out, breathe out, breathe out, breathe out)
And tune in (Tune in, tune in, tune in, tune in)
I just had to breathe
And tune in
I just had to breathe
And tune in
I just had to breathe

Oh, was enlightenment found
No, but I'm tryin', takin' it one year at a time
Oh, oh, can you hear the sound
It's shimmerin' higher
On the beach, I'm buildin' a pyre
(Use the wood brought in by the tide)
I know you'll show me how, I'll know when it's time
To take off my robes and step into the choir

"Helen Of Troy"

Hey, hey

You've heard it all before
One minute, I was killing 'em all
And the next, a brown suit wouldn't let me perform, ah
Typical
So I took a happy face
And it's coming on like a charm
I don't wanna get lost, I wanna worship the sun
If you want, you can come

I'm in my own little golden age
But it's such a pill when they don't appreciate

So when you smoke that cigarette
Or when you talk shit 'bout an old friend
I know it's hard, but do your best
Give yourself a break, have a little faith, ah
Let's hear it for the girls
Living in the modern world

They're banging on the door
"Everyone please make way
For the girl who looks like she flew in from outer space
Yesterday, eh"
I think I'll wait it out
My little thing is keeping 'em keen
They could be drinking with you, but they'll be looking at me
This whole time, I've been playing it coy
The city's falling for me just like I'm Helen of Troy, ah

So when you're broke, can't get ahead
Or when you take it out on your boyfriend
I know it's hard, but do your best
Give yourself a break, have a little faith
Let's hear it for the girls
Living in the modern world

Give yourself a break, have a little faith
Let's hear it for the girls
Living in the modern world
Let's hear it for the girls (Let's hear it for the girls)
Living in the modern world (Living in the modern world)

"Hold No Grudge"

Remember when we used to sing, baby, up in your room
Before your mother got home
There was a sound to our innocence
Our voices were lovers in the same bed
Now I'm not sure how they would sound, isn't that sad
Now that the ocean's all waves and the diamonds are blood
There's a new girl on your song
I didn't know that I could be replaced
Years ago, I tried to get a message to you
But I never heard back, I never heard back

Where did we go wrong
Our haven was always in the song
But just when I go to close the gates permanently
I realise that it isn't me

No, I don't keep a list, can't hold a grudge
Don't you think that we both might've done some growing up
Well, I know that some shit was said and done
But it's such a different world now, I can't hate anyone

Remember when we woke at dawn
Saw the silver sun in your old Citron
And remember when we took them on
Stoners on the run, How the West Was Won

Remember when we used to swim, baby, no one around
Take off all our clothes
And in the clear cold, we were born again
I used to count down to your birthday
Now I'm not sure if it's June or July, isn't that sad

Where did we go wrong
Our haven was always in the song
But just when I go to close the gates permanently
I realise that it isn't me

No, I don't keep a list, can't hold a grudge (Hold no grudge)
Don't you think that we both might've done some growing up
Yeah, I know that some shit was said and done (Said and done)
But it's such a different world now, I can't hate anyone

Remember when we woke at dawn
Saw the silver sun in your old Citron
And remember when we took them on
Stoners on the run, How the West Was Won

Acting my age, not my horoscope
Guess that's growing up
Now I'm sending you love and wishing you well
Wherever you are

"Easy"
(with Son Lux)

Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy, easy

Easy, easy
You switch the screens over the
Rest of your flows
Easy, easy
They poke around until they
Get what they want
Easy, easy

Oh, easy, easy
Throw out the lunch you paid for
Thought it would suck, but now it's
Easy, oh, easy
Throw out the lunch you paid for
Oh, easy, easy

Easy, easy
Pull out the heart that keeps you
Feeling alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone
Easy

"Everybody Wants To Rule The World"
(from "The Hunger Games Catching Fire" soundtrack)

Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you

Acting on your best behavior
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own desire
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most of freedom
And of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do, I'll be right behind you
So glad we've almost made it
So sad we had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world

"Flicker (Kanye West Rework)"
(from "The Hunger Games Mockingjay, Part 1" soundtrack)

I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
It keeps my veins hot, the fires find a home in me
I move through town, I'm quiet like a fight
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it

And now people talk to me, but nothing ever hits home
People talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
I'm done with it (ooh)

This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We're at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

I dream all year, but they're not the sweet kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time

And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison
And I'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me
I'm done with it (ooh)

This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We're at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat
Sparking up my heart
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat

"Good Fights"

Face the world, tell your friends
You don't really love them
But you really love when
Braid your hair and give in
We could try to get in to the place where it ends
Where everything ends, it spins again

Oh, I didn't come all this way just to blow the night
Oh, you can feel sorry for people that are in your mind
Oh, and if it feels close, even when you don't feel alright
(It's alright, it's alright)
Everyone stay up like a good fight

There's a place in your head for what doesn't make sense
For the things you don't get
Look them up when you get in
We could try to get in, get rejected again
Laugh it off again, I guess oh well

Oh, I didn't come all this way just to blow the night
Oh, you can feel sorry for people are in your mind
Oh, and if it feels close, even when you don't feel alright
(It's alright, it's alright)
Everyone stay up like a good fight

Incurred on to bright green eyes
You used to love to spend up time
Driving like a coil in the little lights out
Money, we solve our safe
She'll toss her head and play again
Examine every face and realize
Oh, it's good to feel again

Oh, I didn't come all this way just to blow the night
Oh, you can feel sorry for people are in your mind
Oh, and if it feels close, even when you don't feel alright
(It's alright, it's alright)
Everyone stay up like a good fight

"Homemade Dynamite (Remix)"
(feat. SA, Post Malone & Khalid)

[Lorde]
A couple rebel Top Gun pilots
Flyin' with nowhere to be, ooh-ooh
Don't know you super well
But I think that you might be the same as me
Behave abnormally

Let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Yeah, awesome, right
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
See me rollin', showin' someone else love
Dancin' with our shoes off
Know I think you're awesome, right

[Lorde (SA)]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
(Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite)

[Khalid]
I wanna feel the light
Pushing our limits, unbuckled for the ride, mm
We're way too far from home
Let's be honest with ourselves
We're way too high to drive
So let's take on the night (Mmm)
If the light is in the air, open, finally
We're going and we're free

[Khalid & Lorde]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

[SA]
I checked your girl at the door
I sent your friend to the store
It's only me and you, finally us two
And I don't regret drinkin' this liquor
Makin' you listen
Yeah, I know you don't know me well
My girl's at the door and I left my pretense at home
And it ain't no goin' back (Goin' back)

Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

[Post Malone]
Walk, never fall, but we still run
So pour up, pour up another one
I know, I know we on to somethin'
We got, we got a loaded gun, yeah
Go and shoot me that look in your eyes
And you're here, I'm yours, you're mine
Find each other when we're losin' our minds
Then we take it all off
You're a runaway train, yeah
And you got me so faded
And I don't wanna chase it, no
You know I think you're awesome, right

Our rules, our dreams, we're blind

Now you know it's really gonna blow

"Ladder Song"
(from "The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 1" soundtrack)

No one knows where the ladder goes
You're gonna lose what you love the most
You're not alone in anything
You're not unique in dying

I feel estranged every now and then
Fall asleep reading science fiction
I wanna fly in your silver ship
Let my mama hang and my sister sit

It's on now
The days are long now
The ups and the sundowns
And a twisting mind

If I gotta go first
I'll do it on my terms
I'm tired of traitors
Always changing sides
They were friends of mine

Don't hang around once the promise breaks
Or you'll be there when the next one's made
Kiss the feet of a charlatan
Some imagine freedom

All the rest is predictable
Trying your hardest to melt the snow
Tie the knots to concentrate
Keep on pulling, that rope will break

We'll welcome the new age
Covered in warrior paint
Lights from the jungle to the sky

See now, a star bursts
Looks just like a blood orange
Don't it just make you wanna cry
Precious friend of mine

Will I know when it's finally done
This whole life's a hallucination
You're not alone in anything
You're not alone in trying to be

"No Better"

We roll in heavy summer when there's strength in our numbers
And your breath's hot and gross but I kiss you like a lover
Legs stick to the seats of the car someone grew into
I forget the knowledge from the lessons that I went to

And Jamie picks fights but they're weak and short-lived
Because no one can be bothered when it's humid like this
And we roll in heavy summer like it's shameful to be underneath a ceiling or a roof try come out and steal our thunder

Now the days are getting cooler
And the burning of our limbs doesn't happen quite as bad and the burn is just
Skin-deep in the fantasies and dreams of the winter like the movies
That we watched to pretend it wasn't winter
And everywhere we go I can feel a subtle taste of the deeds outgrown and the welcome overstayed
And you're no better at swimming than you were in the beginning but you come over at night and we practice all the breathing

Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down

I'll pull the trick if I want to
I'll pull the trick and it comes true
I'm chewing gum and it's killing you
We're getting dead and it's the right way to do it
I see you happy in the front seat
I see you with all of your front teeth
You're allergic but you never said
We're getting dead and it's the right way

Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down

"Precious Metals"
(live version)

The Chanel, the Dior and the Prada
Take it home, make a fire in the garden
Sundance kids, so godless
One day it's gonna be not like this
Black sand on all our beaches
Witchcraft, split lip and a bee sting
But what I really wanna know is

Do I look like a fool
'Cause I must be a fool
To hold on to precious metals like I do, I do, I do
To hold on to precious metals like I do, I do, I do

The Chanel, the Dior, and the Prada
Give my best to the ones that are bothered
Take a flight trip to Jakarta
All the kids at the shows make it louder
All of the feelings and all of the tears are going
All of the secrets and all of the schemes that don't go my way
I wish you would come back, didn't want to run back
Come back, bet you want to come back
And I'll find you

Do I look like a fool
'Cause I must be a fool
To hold on to precious metals like I do (ah), do (ah), do (ah)
To hold on to precious metals like I do (ah), do (ah), do (ah)

Ah, ah, ah...

"Supercut (El-P Remix)"
(feat. Run The Jewels)

[Lorde]
In my
Supercut of us
Supercut
Supercut of, supercut of, supercut of us

In my head
I play a supercut of us
All the magic we gave off
All the love we had and lost
And in my head
The visions never stop
These ribbons wrap me up
But when I reach for you
There's just a supercut

Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us

In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
In your car, the supercut of us
We keep tryna talk about us
Slow motion, I'm watchin' our love
In your car, the supercut of, supercut of

[Killer Mike]
We is the villains, and there ain't no chillin'
Get body bags and the toe tags, yeah
Scoundrels in housin', we tore through your town
And we reload it and now we back, man
Forgiato rollin' on a '96 Impala
With a pretty thing, show me where I'm slayin'
I ain't playin' with you lames, 700 horse in the Hellcat
Take ya bitch, where ya at

[El-P]
Dirty, all-black Jeep, 2018
With the clean rhyme rappers on deck, check
Came with the bad bars, bully with the big box
Shush when the runners on set
G-G-Give it up, you don't got a bit of luck left
Nah, not even a itty bit of fresh (Good lord)
Fall on your sword for the crime abhorrent
That's your reward for the mindless whorin'

[Killer Mike]
This for everybody that hated
Michael and Jamie, we made it
Every debt due, we paid it
My cadence is heinous
You keep tryna play us, and you gon' be famous
And just like the top on my 7-5 drop
I'm just hittin' a button and you gon' be brainless
And that's from the back of a 'lac where I'm smokin' the sack
With my girl, watchin' seasons of Shameless

[El-P]
There's no manual, Run The Jewels publish shit annual
Every minute I'm in it, I'm runnin' a clinic
Wild animal, livin' like a Fine Young Cannibal
Citizen of cynics, admit it, the kid get it
Earth's a hot block, the pot get chop-chopped
You walk and watch blocks my heart should pop off
The hot rocks shooters will knock your whole op off
That's why I don't got tocks on the clock to rock soft

[Lorde]
So I fall
Into continents and cars
All the stages and the stars
I turn all of it
To just a su

Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of, supercut of, super, super

"Swingin' Party"

Bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending, can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail

If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line

Pound the prairie pavement, losing proposition
Quitting school and going to work and never going fishing
Water all around, I never learned how to swim now

If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line

Bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending, can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail

If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong is what you want, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line

"Yellow Flicker Beat"
(from "The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 1" soundtrack)

I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold

"I Had A King"

I had a king in a tenement castle
Lately he's taken to painting the pastel walls brown
He's taken the curtains down
He's swept with the broom of contempt
And the rooms have an empty ring 
He's cleaned with the tears 
Of an actor who fears for the laughter's sting 

I can't go back there anymore 
You know my keys won't fit the door 
You know my thoughts don't fit the man 
They never can they never can

I had a king dressed in drip-dry and paisley 
Lately he's taken to saying I'm crazy and blind 
He lives in another time 
Ladies in gingham still blush 
While he sings them of wars and wine 
But I in my leather and lace 
I can never become that kind 

I can't go back there anymore 
You know my keys won't fit the door 
You know my thoughts don't fit the man 
They never can they never can

I had a king in a salt-rusted carriage 
Who carried me off to his country for marriage too soon
Beware of the power of moons
There's no one to blame
No there's no one to name as a traitor here 
The king's on the road
And the queen's in the grove till the end of the year

I can't go back there anymore 
You know my keys won't fit the door 
You know my thoughts don't fit the man 
They never can they never can
They never can they never can

"Michael From Mountains"

Michael wakes you up with sweets
He takes you up streets and the rain comes down
Sidewalk markets locked up tight
And umbrellas bright on a grey background
There's oil on the puddles in taffeta patterns
That run down the drain
In colored arrangements
That Michael will change with a stick that he found

Michael from mountains
Go where you will go to
Know that I will know you
Someday I may know you very well

Michael brings you to a park
He sings and it's dark when the clouds come by
Yellow slickers up on swings
Like puppets on strings hanging in the sky
They'll splash home to suppers in wallpapered kitchens
Their mothers will scold
But Michael will hold you
To keep away cold till the sidewalks are dry-

Michael from mountains
Go where you will go to
Know that I will know you
Someday I may know you very well

Michael leads you up the stairs
He needs you to care and you know you do
Cats come crying to the key
And dry you will be in a towel or two
There's rain in the window
There's sun in the painting that smiles on the wall
You want to know all
But his mountains have called so you never do-

Michael from mountains
Go where you will go to
Know that I will know you
Someday I may know you very well

"Night In The City"

Light up light up
Light up your lazy blue eyes
Moon's up nights up
Taking the town by surprise
Night time night time
Day left an hour ago
City light time
Must you get ready so slow
There are places to come from and places to go

Night in the city looks pretty to me
Night in the city looks fine
Music comes spilling out into the street
Colors go flashing in time

Take off take off
Take off your stay-at-home shoes
Break off shake off
Chase off those stay-at-home blues
Stairway stairway
Down to the crowds in the street
They go their way
Looking for faces to greet
But we run on laughing with no one to meet

Night in the city looks pretty to me
Night in the city looks fine
Music comes spilling out into the street
Colors go waltzing in time

"Marcie"

Marcie in a coat of flowers
Stops inside a candy store
Reds are sweet and greens are sour
Still no letter at her door
So she'll wash her flower curtains
Hang them in the wind to dry
Dust her tables with his shirt and
Wave another day goodbye

Marcie's faucet needs a plumber
Marcie's sorrow needs a man
Red is autumn green is summer
Greens are turning and the sand
All along the ocean beaches
Stares up empty at the sky
Marcie buys a bag of peaches
Stops a postman passing by
And summer goes
Falls to the sidewalk like string and brown paper
Winter blows
Up from the river there's no one to take her
To the sea

Marcie dresses warm it's snowing
Takes a yellow cab uptown
Red is stop and green's for going
Sees a show and rides back down
Down along the Hudson River
Past the shipyards in the cold
Still no letter's been delivered
Still the winter days unfold
Like magazines
Fading in dusty grey attics and cellars
Make a dream
Dream back to summer and hear how he tells her
Wait for me

Marcie leaves and doesn't tell us
Where or why she moved away
Red is angry green is jealous
That was all she had to say
Someone thought they saw her Sunday
Window shopping in the rain
Someone heard she bought a one-way ticket
And went west again

"Nathan La Franeer"

I hired a coach to take me from confusion to the plane
And though we shared a common space I know I'll never meet again
The driver with his eyebrows furrowed in the rear-view mirror
I read his name and it was plainly written Nathan La Franeer
I asked him would he hurry
But we crawled the canyons slowly
Thru the buyers and the sellers
Thru the burglar bells and the wishing wells
With gangs and girly shows
The ghostly garden grows

The cars and buses bustled thru the bedlam of the day
I looked thru window-glass at streets and Nathan grumbled at the grey
I saw an aging cripple selling Superman balloons
The city grated thru chrome-plate
The clock struck slowly half-past-noon
Thru the tunnel tiled and turning
Into daylight once again I am escaping
Once again goodbye
To symphonies and dirty trees
With parks and plastic clothes
The ghostly garden grows

He asked me for a dollar more
He cursed me to my face
He hated everyone who paid to ride
And share his common space
I picked my bags up from the curb
And stumbled to the door
Another man reached out his hand
Another hand reached out for more
And I filled it full of silver
And I left the fingers counting
And the sky goes on forever
Without meter maids and peace parades

You feed it all your woes
The ghostly garden grows

"Sisotowbell Lane"

Sisotowbell Lane
Noah is fixing the pump in the rain
He brings us no shame
We always knew that he always knew
Up over the hill
Jovial neighbors come down when they will
With stories to tell
Sometimes they do
Yes sometimes we do
We have a rocking chair
Each of us rocks his share
Eating muffin buns and berries
By the steamy kitchen window
Sometimes we do
Our tongues turn blue
Sisotowbell Lane
Anywhere else now would seem very strange
The seasons are changing
Everyday in everyway
Sometimes it is spring
Sometimes it is not anything
A poet can sing
Sometimes we try
Yes we always try
We have a rocking chair
Somedays we rock and stare
At the woodlands and the grasslands and the badlands 'cross the river
Sometimes we do
We like the view
Sisotowbell Lane
Go to the city you'll come back again
To wade thru the grain
You always do
Yes we always do
Come back to the stars
Sweet well water and pickling jars
We'll lend you the car
We always do
Yes sometimes we do
We have a rocking chair
Someone is always there
Rocking rhythms while they're waiting with the candle in the window
Sometimes we do
We wait for you

"The Dawntreader"

Peridots and periwinkle blue medallions
Gilded galleons spilled across the ocean floor
Treasure somewhere in the sea and he will find where
Never mind their questions there's no answer for
The roll of the harbor wake
The songs that the rigging makes
The taste of the spray he takes
And he learns to give
He aches and he learns to live
He stakes all his silver
On a promise to be free
Mermaids live in colonies
All his seadreams come to me

City satins left at home I will not need them
I believe him when he tells of loving me
Something truthful in the sea your lies will find you
Leave behind your streets he said and come to me
Come down from the neon nights
Come down from the tourist sights
Run down till the rain delights you
You do not hide
Sunlight will renew your pride
Skin white by skin golden
Like a promise to be free
Dolphins playing in the sea
All his seadreams come to me

Seabird I have seen you fly above the pilings
I am smiling at your circles in the air
I will come and sit by you while he lies sleeping
Fold your fleet wings I have brought some dreams to share
A dream that you love someone
A dream that the wars are done
A dream that you tell no one but the grey sea
They'll say that you're crazy
And a dream of a baby
Like a promise to be free
Children laughing out to sea
All his seadreams come to me

"The Pirate Of Penance"

[PENANCE CRANE]
The pirate anchored on a Wednesday
And why he came to port I wonder
To see a lady so my friends say
She dances for the sailors
In a smoky cabaret bar underground
Down in a cellar in a harbor town
I know he told her love was treasure
And they would reap the fullest bounty
He only comes to port for pleasure
So when the winds of morning
Blew the curtains in she woke and found he'd gone
I saw his sails unfurling Thursday dawn
The pirate he will sink you with a kiss
He'll steal your heart and sail away

[THE DANCER]
Saturday early we met in the cove near the forest

[PENANCE]
He'll leave you drowning in the flotsam of a broken promise in the bay

[THE DANCER]
(Dancing we wakened the dawn and the birds into chorus)

[PENANCE]
He came again to see her
Yes I think they told me it was Saturday

[THE DANCER]
(Ask Penance Crane she was out in her garden she saw us)

[PENANCE]
I was at sea then
I didn't see them
I don't believe what you are saying
It isn't true I hardly knew him
Is this some game that you are playing
Go ask the dancer she's the one who saw him last
The one who drew him here
He hasn't come to me since spring last year
There was a time when he would
Bring me silks and sandalwood and Persian lace

[THE DANCER]
(Then came another "goodbye" and another "Please don't go")

[PENANCE]
And he would hold me close
And tell my sailing stories by the fireplace

[THE DANCER]
(All night I dance and all day I keep watch with my sorrow)

[PENANCE]
I was at sea I tell you I was
Nowhere near the mentioned murder place

[THE DANCER]
(Searching for sails that don't come
And I guess but I don't know)

[PENANCE]
Go ask the dancer
She knows the answer

[THE DANCER]
I don't know

[PENANCE]
She knows the answer

[THE DANCER]
I don't know

[PENANCE]
She knows the answer

[THE DANCER]
I don't know

"Song To A Seagull"

Fly silly seabird
No dreams can possess you
No voices can blame you
For sun on your wings
My gentle relations
Have names they must call me
For loving the freedom
Of all flying things
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach out of cry

I came to the city
And lived like old Crusoe
On an island of noise
In a cobblestone sea
And the beaches were concrete
And the stars paid a light bill
And the blossoms hung false
On their store window trees
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach out of cry

Out of the city
And down to the seaside
To sun on my shoulders
And wind in my hair
But sandcastles crumble
And hunger is human
And humans are hungry
For worlds they can't share
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach out of cry

I call to a seagull
Who dives to the waters
And catches his silver-fine
Dinner alone
Crying where are the footprints
That danced on these beaches
And the hands that cast wishes
That sunk like a stone
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach, out of cry

"Cactus Tree"

There's a man who's been out sailing
In a decade full of dreams
And he takes her to a schooner
And he treats her like a queen
Bearing beads from California
With their amber stones and green

He has called her from the harbor
He has kissed her with his freedom
He has heard her off to starboard
In the breaking and the breathing
Of the water weeds

While she was busy being free

There's a man who's climbed a mountain
And he's calling out her name
And he hopes her heart can hear
Three thousand miles he calls again
He can think her there beside him
He can miss her just the same

He has missed her in the forest
While he showed her all the flowers
And the branches sang the chorus
As he climbed the scaly towers
Of a forest tree

While she was somewhere being free

There's a man who's sent a letter and he's waiting for reply
He has asked her of her travels since the day they said goodbye
He writes, "Wish you were beside me, we can make it if we try."

He has seen her at the office
With her name on all these papers
Through the sharing of the profits
He will find it hard to shake her
From his memory

And she's so busy being free

There's a lady, in the city
And she thinks she loves them all
There's the one who's thinking of her
There's the one who sometimes calls
There's the one who writes her letters
With his facts and figures scrawl

She has brought them to her senses
They have laughed inside her laughter
Now she rallies her defenses
For she fears that one will ask her
For eternity

And she's so busy being free

There's a man who sends her medals
He is bleeding from the war
There's a jouster and a jester
And a man who owns a store
There's a drummer, and a dreamer
And you know there may be more

She will love them when she sees them
They will lose her if they follow
And she only means to please them
And her heart is full and hollow
Like a cactus tree

While she's so busy being free

Like a cactus tree
Being free

"Tin Angel"

Varnished weeds in window jars
Tarnished beads on tapestries
Kept in satin boxes are
Reflections of love's memories

Letters from across the seas
Roses dipped in sealing wax
Valentines and maple leaves
Tucked into a paperback

Guess I'll throw them all away
I found someone to love today

Dark with darker moods is he
Not a golden Prince who's come
Through columbines and wizardry
To talk of castles in the sun

Still I'll take a chance and see
I found someone to love today

There's a sorrow in his eyes
Like the angel made of tin
What will happen if I try
To place another heart in him

In a Bleecker Street cafe
I found someone to love today
I found someone to love today

"Chelsea Morning"

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window, and the traffic wrote the words
It came a-reeling up like Christmas bells, and rapping up like pipes and drums

Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll wear it 'till the night comes

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains, and a rainbow on the wall
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you, crimson crystal beads to beckon

Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
There's a sun show every second

Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today
And the streets are paved with passersby
And pigeons fly
And papers lie
Waiting to blow away

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey and a bowl of oranges, too
And the sun poured in like butterscotch and stuck to all my senses
Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses

When the curtain closes and the rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By candlelight
By jewel-light
If only you will stay
Pretty baby, won't you
Wake up, it's a Chelsea morning

"I Don't Know Where I Stand"

Funny day, looking for laughter and finding it there
Sunny day, braiding wild flowers and leaves in my hair
Picked up a pencil and wrote "I love you" in my finest hand
Wanted to send it, but I don't know where I stand

Telephone, even the sound of your voice is still new
All alone in California and talking to you
And feeling too foolish and strange to say the words that I had planned
I guess it's too early, 'cause I don't know where I stand

Crickets call, courting their ladies in star-dappled green
Thickets tall, until the morning comes up like a dream
All muted and misty, so drowsy now I'll take what sleep I can
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand

"That Song About The Midway"

I met you on a midway at a fair last year
And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear
You were playing on the horses, you were playing on the guitar strings
You were playing like a devil wearing wings, wearing wings
You looked so grand wearing wings
Do you tape them to your shoulders just to sing
Can you fly
I heard you can Can you fly
Like an eagle doin' your hunting from the sky

I followed with the sideshows to another town
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds
You were betting on some lover, you were shaking up the dice
And I thought I saw you cheating once or twice, once or twice

I heard your bid once or twice
Were you wondering was the gamble worth the price
Pack it in
I heard you did Pack it in
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew could win

So lately you've been hiding - it was somewhere in the news
And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues
And a voice calls out the numbers, and it sometimes mentions mine
And I feel like I've been working overtime, overtime

I've lost my fire overtime
Always playin' one more hand for one more dime
Slowin' down I'm gettin' tired
Slowin' down
And I envy you the valley that you've found
'Cause I'm midway down the midway
Slowin' down, down, down, down

"Roses Blue"

I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles
I think of rain, I think of roses blue
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble
To see the place she's lately gotten to
Gotten to, gotten to

She's gotten to mysterious devotions
She's gotten to the zodiac and en
She's gotten into tarot cards and potions
She's laying her religion on her friends
On her friends, on her friends

Friends who come to ask her for their future
Friends who come to find they can't be friends
Because of signs and seasons that don't suit her
She'll prophesy your death, she won't say when
Won't say when, won't say when

When all the black cards come you cannot barter
No, when all your stars are stacked you cannot win
She'll shake her head and treat you like a martyr
It is her blackest spell she puts you in
Puts you in, puts you in

In sorrow she can lure you where she wants you
Inside your own self-pity there you swim
In sinking down to drown her voice still haunts you
And only with your laughter can you win
Can you win, can you win

You win the lasting laurels with your laughter
It reaches like an arm before you sink
To win the solitary truth you're after
You dare not ask the priestess how to think
How to think, how to think

I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles
I think of rain, I think of roses blue
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble
To see the place she's lately gotten to
Gotten to, gotten to

"The Gallery"

When I first saw your gallery
I liked the ones of ladies
Then you began to hang up me
You studied to portray me
In ice and greens
And old blue jeans
And naked in the roses
Then you got into funny scenes
That all your work discloses

"Lady, don't love me now I am dead
I am a saint, turn down your bed
I have no heart," that's what you said
You said, "I can be cruel
But let me be gentle with you"

Somewhere in a magazine
I found a page about you
I see that now it's Josephine
Who cannot be without you
I keep your house in fit repair
I dust the portraits daily
Your mail comes here from everywhere
The writing looks like ladies'

"Lady, please love me now, I am dead
I am a saint, turn down your bed
I have no heart," that's what you said
You said, "I can be cruel
But let me be gentle with you"

I gave you all my pretty years
Then we began to weather
And I was left to winter here
While you went west for pleasure
And now you're flying back this way
Like some lost homing pigeon
They've monitored your brain, you say
And changed you with religion

"Lady, please love me now I was dead
I am no saint, turn down your bed
Lady, have you no heart," that's what you said
Well, I can be cruel
But let me be gentle with you

When I first saw your gallery
I liked the ones of ladies
But now their faces follow me
And all their eyes look shady

"I Think I Understand"

Daylight falls upon the path, the forest falls behind
Today I am not prey to dark uncertainty
The shadow trembles in its wrath, I've robbed its blackness blind
And tasted sunlight as my fear came clear to me

I think I understand
Fear is like a wilderland
Stepping stones or sinking sand

Now the way leads to the hills, above the steeple's chime
Below me sleepy rooftops round the harbor
It's there I'll take my thirsty fill of friendship over wine
Forgetting fear but never disregarding her

Oh, I think I understand
Fear is like a wilderland
Stepping stones and sinking sand

Sometimes voices in the night will call me back again
Back along the pathway of a troubled mind
When forests rise to block the light that keeps a traveler sane
I'll challenge them with flashes from a brighter time

Oh, I think I understand
Fear is like a wilderland
Stepping stones or sinking sand

"Songs To Aging Children Come"

Through the windless wells of wonder
By the throbbing light machine
In a tea leaf trance or under
Orders from the king and queen

Songs to aging children come
Aging children, I am one

People hurry by so quickly
Don't they hear the melodies
In the chiming and the clicking
And the laughing harmonies

Songs to aging children come
Aging children, I am one

Some come dark and strange like dying
Crows and ravens whistling
Lines of weeping, strings of crying
So much said in listening

Songs to aging children come
Aging children, I am one

Does the moon play only silver
When it strums the galaxy
Dying roses will they will their
Perfumed rhapsodies to me

Songs to aging children come
This is one

"The Fiddle And The Drum"

And so once again
My dear Johnny my dear friend
And so once again you are fightin' us all
And when I ask you why
You raise your sticks and cry, and I fall
Oh, my friend
How did you come
To trade the fiddle for the drum

You say I have turned
Like the enemies you've earned
But I can remember
All the good things you are
And so I ask you please
Can I help you find the peace and the star
Oh, my friend
What time is this
To trade the handshake for the fist

And so once again
Oh, America my friend
And so once again
You are fighting us all
And when we ask you why
You raise your sticks and cry and we fall
Oh, my friend
How did you come
To trade the fiddle for the drum

You say we have turned
Like the enemies you've earned
But we can remember
All the good things you are
And so we ask you please
Can we help you find the peace and the star
Oh my friend
We have all come
To fear the beating of your drum

"Both Sides Now"

Rows and floes of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say "I love you" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all

I've looked at life from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all

"Morning Morgantown"

When morning comes to Morgantown
The merchants roll their awnings down
The milktrucks make their morning rounds
In morning Morgantown

We'll rise up early, with the sun
To ride the bus while everyone is yawning
And the day is young
In morning Morgantown

Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams a dollar down
Morning any town you name
Morning's just the same

We'll find a table in the shade
And sip our tea and lemonade
And watch the morning on parade
In morning Morgantown

Ladies in their rainbow fashions
Colored stop and go lights flashing
We'll wink at total strangers passing
In morning Morgantown

Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams a dollar down
Morning any town you name
Morning's just the same

I'd like to buy you everything
A wooden bird with painted wings
A window full of colored rings
In morning Morgantown

But the only thing I have to give
To make you smile, to win you with
Are all the mornings still to live
In morning Morgantown

"For Free"

I slept last night in a good hotel
I went shopping today for jewels
The wind rushed around in the dirty town
And the children let out from the schools
I was standing on a noisy corner
Waiting for the walking green
Across the street he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet for free

Now me I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I got a black limousine and two gentlemen
Escorting me to the halls
And I play if you have the money
Or if you're a friend to me
But the one man band
By the quick lunch stand
He was playing real good for free

Nobody stopped to hear him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never been on their TV
So they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain
As the signal changed
He was playing real good for free

"Conversation"

He comes for conversation
I comfort him sometimes
Comfort and consultation
He knows that's what he'll find
I bring him apples and cheeses
He brings me songs to play
He sees me when he pleases
I see him in cafes
And I only say, hello
And turn away before his lady knows
How much I want to see him
She removes him, like a ring
To wash her hands
She only brings him out to show her friends
I want to free him

Secrets and sharing soda
That's how our time began
Love is a story told to a friend
It's second hand
But I'll listen to his questions
I'll give my answers when they're found
He says she keeps him guessing
But I know she keeps him down

She speaks in sorry sentences
Miraculous repentances
I don't believe her
Tomorrow he will come to me
And he'll speak his sorrow endlessly and he'll ask me why
Why can't I leave her

He comes for conversation
I comfort him sometimes
Comfort and consultation
He knows that's what he'll find
He knows that's what... he'll find

"Ladies Of The Canyon"

Trina wears her wampum beads
She fills her drawing book with lines
Sewing lace on widows' weeds
And filigree on leaf and vine
Vine and leaf are filigree
And her coat's a second-hand one
Trimmed with antique luxury
She is a lady of the canyon

Annie sits you down to eat
She always makes you welcome in
Cats and babies 'round her feet
And all are fat and none are thin
None are thin and all are fat
She may bake some brownies today
Saying, you are welcome back
She is another canyon lady

Estrella circus girl
Comes wrapped in songs and gypsy shawls
Songs like tiny hammers hurled
At beveled mirrors in empty halls
Empty halls and beveled mirrors
Sailing seas and climbing banyans
Come out for a visit here
To be a lady of the canyon

Trina takes her paints and her threads
And she weaves a pattern all her own
Annie bakes her cakes and her breads
And she gathers flowers for her home
For her home she gathers flowers
And Estrella, dear companion
Colors up the sunshine hours
Pouring music down the canyon
Coloring the sunshine hours
They are the ladies of the canyon

"Willy"

Willy is my child, he is my father
I would be his lady all my life
He says he'd love to live with me
But for an ancient injury
That has not healed
He said I feel once again
Like I gave my heart too soon
He stood looking through the lace
At the face on the conquered moon
And counting all the cars up the hill
And the stars on my window sill
There are still more reasons why
I love him

Willy is my joy, he is my sorrow
Now he wants to run away and hide
He says our love cannot be real
He cannot hear the chapel's pealing silver bells
But you know it's hard to tell
When you're in the spell if it's wrong or if it's real
But you're bound to lose
If you let the blues get you scared to feel
And I feel like I'm just being born
Like a shiny light breaking in a storm
There are so many reasons why I love him

Willy is my child, he is my father

"The Arrangement"

You could have been more
Than a name on the door
On the thirty-third floor in the air
More than a credit card
Swimming pool in the backyard

While you still have the time 
you could get away and find
A better life, you know the grind
Is so ungrateful
Racing cars, whiskey bars
No one cares who you really are

You're the keeper of the cards
Yes I know it gets hard
Keeping the wheels turning
And the wife she keeps the keys
She is so pleased to be
A part of the arrangement

You could have been more than a name on the door
On the thirty-third floor in the air
More than a consumer
Lying in some room trying to die
More than a credit card
Swimming pool in the backyard

You could have been more than a name on the door
You could have been more than a name on the door
You could have been more
You could have been more
You could have been more

"Rainy Night House"

It was a rainy night
We took a taxi to your mother's home
She went to Florida and left you
With your father's gun alone
Upon her small white bed
I fell into a dream
You sat up all the night and watched me
To see who in the world I might be

I am from the Sunday school
I sing soprano in the upstairs choir
You are a holy man
On the FM radio
I sat up all the night and watched thee
To see who in the world you might be

You called me beautiful
You called your mother - she was very tanned
So you packed your tent and you went
To live out in the Arizona sand
You are a refugee
From a wealthy family
You gave up all the golden factories
To see who in the world you might be

"The Priest"

The priest sat in the airport bar
He was wearing his father's tie
And his eyes looked into my eyes so far
Whenever the words ran dry
Behind the lash and the circles blue
He looked as only a priest can, thru
And his eyes said me and his eyes said you
And my eyes said, let us try

He said, "You wouldn't like it here
No it's no place you should share
The roof is ripped with hurricanes
And the room is always bare
I need the wind and I seek the cold"
He reached past the wine for my hand to hold
And he saw me young and he saw me old
And he saw me sitting there

Then he took his contradictions out
And he splashed them on my brow
So which words was I then to doubt
When choosing what to vow
Should I choose them all-should I make them mine
The sermons, the hymns and the valentines
And he asked for truth and he asked for time
And he asked for only now
Now the trials are trumpet scored
Oh will we pass the test
Or just as one loves more and more
Will one love less and less
Oh come let's run from this ring we're in
Where the Christians clap and the Germans grin
Saying let them lose, crying let them win
Oh make them both confess

"Blue Boy"

Lady called the blue boy, love,
She took him home
Made himself an idol, yes,
So he turned to stone
Like a pilgrim she travelled
To place her flowers
Before his granite grace
And she prayed aloud for love
To waken in his face
In his face, oh

Sometimes in the evening
He would read to her
Roll her in his arms
And give his seed to her
She would wake in the morning
Without him
And go to the window
And look out thru the pain
But the statue in her garden
He always looked the same
He looked the same, oh

Bring her boots of leather
And she will dance for him
Shyly from a feather fan
She'll glance for him
Here he comes after midnight
To find her again
He will come a few times more
Till he finds a lady statue
Standing in a door
In her door, oh

"Big Yellow Taxi"

They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique
And a swinging hot spot

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot

They took all the trees
Put 'em in a tree museum
Then they charged the people
A dollar and a half just to see 'em

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot

Hey, farmer, farmer
Put away that DDT now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees
Please

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot

Late last night I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot

I said
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot

They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot

"Woodstock"

I came upon a child of God
He was walking along the road
And I asked him, where are you going
And this he told me...
I'm going on down to Yasgur's farm
I'm gonna join in a rock 'n' roll band
I'm gonna camp out on the land
I'm gonna try and get my soul free

We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

Then can I walk beside you
I have come here to lose the smog
And I feel to be a cog in something turning
Well maybe it is just the time of year
Or maybe it's the time of man
I don't know who I am
But you know life is for learning

We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere there was song and celebration
And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky
And they were turning into butterflies
Above our nation

We are stardust
Billion year old carbon
We are golden
Caught in the devil's bargain
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

"The Circle Game"

Yesterday a child came out to wonder
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
And tearful at the falling of a star

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
Skated over ten clear frozen streams
Words like when you're older must appease him
And promises of someday make his dreams

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
Cartwheels turn to car wheels thru the town
And they tell him take your time it won't be long now
Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
There'll be new dreams maybe better dreams and plenty
Before the last revolving year is through

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

"All I Want"

I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
Traveling, traveling, traveling
Looking for something, what can it be
Oh I hate you some, I hate you some
I love you some
Oh I love you when I forget about me
I wanna be strong, I wanna laugh along
I wanna belong to the living
Alive, alive, I wanna get up and jive
Wanna wreck my stockings in some jukebox dive
Do you want- do you want-
Do you wanna dance with me baby
Do you wanna take a chance on
Maybe finding some sweet romance with me baby
Well come on

All I really, really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you too
All I really, really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you
I wanna talk to you, I wanna shampoo you
I wanna renew you again and again
Applause, applause. Life is our cause
When I think of your kisses
My mind see-saws
Do you see- do you see-
Do you see how you hurt me baby
So I hurt you too
Then we both get so blue

I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
Looking for the key to set me free
Oh the jealousy, the greed is the unraveling
It's the unraveling
And it undoes all the joy that could be
I wanna have fun, I wanna shine like the sun
Wanna be the one that you wanna see
I wanna knit you a sweater
Wanna write you a love letter
Wanna make you feel better
I wanna make you feel free
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm,
Wanna make you feel free
I wanna make you feel free

"My Old Man"

My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man
Keeping away my blues

He's my sunshine in the morning
He's my fireworks at the end of the day
He's the warmest chord I ever heard
Play that warm chord, play and stay baby
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man
Keeping away my blues

But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide

Then he comes home
And he takes me in his loving arms
And he tells me all his troubles
And he tells me all my charms
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
No, my old man
Keeping away my blues

But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide

My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
No, my old man
Keeping away my lonesome blues

"Little Green"

Born with the moon in Cancer
Choose her a name she will answer to
Call her green and the winters cannot fade her
Call her green for the children who've made her
Little green, be a gypsy dancer

He went to California
Hearing that everything's warmer there
So you write him a letter and say, "Her eyes are blue"
He sends you a poem and she's lost to you
Little green, he's a non-conformer

Just a little green
Like the color when the spring is born
There'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
Just a little green
Like the nights when the Northern lights perform
There'll be icicles and birthday clothes
And sometimes there'll be sorrow

Child with a child pretending
Weary of lies you are sending home
So you sign all the papers in the family name
You're sad and you're sorry but you're not ashamed
Little green, have a happy ending

Just a little green
Like the color when the spring is born
There'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
Just a little green
Like the nights when the Northern lights perform
There'll be icicles and birthday clothes
And sometimes there'll be sorrow

"Carey"

The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here Carey
But it's really not my home
My fingernails are filthy, I got beach tar on my feet
And I miss my clean white linen and my fancy French cologne

Oh Carey get out your cane
And I'll put on some silver
Oh you're a mean old Daddy, but I like you fine

Come on down to the Mermaid Caf and I will buy you a bottle of wine
And we'll laugh and toast to nothing and smash our empty glasses down
Let's have a round for these freaks and these soldiers
A round for these friends of mine
Let's have another round for the bright red devil
Who keeps me in this tourist town

Come on, Carey, get out your cane
I'll put on some silver
Oh you're a mean old Daddy, but I like you
I like you
I like you
I like you

Maybe I'll go to Amsterdam
Or maybe I'll go to Rome
And rent me a grand piano and put some flowers 'round my room
But let's not talk about fare-thee-wells now
The night is a starry dome.
And they're playin' that scratchy rock and roll
Beneath the Matala Moon

Come on, Carey, get out your cane
I'll put on some silver
You're a mean old Daddy, but I like you

The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here
But, it's really not my home
Maybe it's been too long a time
Since I was scramblin' down in the street
Now they got me used to that clean white linen
And that fancy French cologne

Oh Carey, get out your cane
I'll put on my finest silver
We'll go to the Mermaid Caf
Have fun tonight
I said, oh, you're a mean old Daddy, but you're out of sight

"Blue"

Blue songs are like tattoos
You know I've been to sea before
Crown and anchor me
Or let me sail away

Hey Blue,
There is a song for you
Ink on a pin
Underneath the skin
An empty space to fill in

Well there's so many sinking now
You've got to keep thinking
You can make it through these waves
Acid, booze, and ass
Needles, guns, and grass
Lots of laughs, lots of laughs

Everybody's saying that hell's the hippest way to go
Well I don't think so
But I'm gonna take a look around it though
Blue, I love you

Blue, here is a shell for you
Inside you'll hear a sigh
A foggy lullaby
There is your song from me

"California"

Sitting in a park in Paris, France
Reading the news and it sure looks bad
They won't give peace a chance
That was just a dream some of us had
Still a lot of lands to see
But I wouldn't wanna stay here
It's too old and cold and settled in its ways here

Oh, but California
California I'm coming home
I'm gonna see the folks I dig
I'll even kiss a Sunset pig
California I'm coming home

I met a redneck on a Grecian isle
Who did the goat dance very well
He gave me back my smile
But he kept my camera to sell
Oh the rogue, the red red rogue
He cooked good omelettes and stews
And I might have stayed on with him there

But my heart cried out for you, California
Oh California I'm coming home
Oh make me feel good rock 'n' roll band
I'm your biggest fan
California, I'm coming home

Oh it gets so lonely
When you're walking
And the streets are full of strangers
All the news of home you read
Just give you the blues
Just give you the blues

So I bought me a ticket
I caught a plane to Spain
Went to a party down a red dirt road
There were lots of pretty people there
Reading Rolling Stone, reading Vogue
They said, "How long can you hang around"
I said a week, maybe two
Just until my skin turns brown

Then I'm going home to California
California I'm coming home
Oh will you take me as I am
Strung out on another man
California, I'm coming home

Oh it gets so lonely
When you're walking
And the streets are full of strangers
All the news of home you read
More about the war
And the bloody changes
Oh will you take me as I am
Will you take me as I am
Will you
Will you take me as I am
Hmmm mmmmm
Take me as I am

"This Flight Tonight"

Look out the left, the captain said
The lights down there that's where we'll land
I saw a falling star burn up
Above the Las Vegas sands
It wasn't the one that you gave to me
That night down south between the trailers
Not the early one
That you can wish upon
Not the northern one
That guides in the sailors

Oh star bright star bright
You've got the lovin' that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight

You got the touch so gentle and sweet
But you've got that look so critical
Now I can't talk to you baby
I get so weak
Sometimes I think love is just mythical
Up there's a heaven
Down there's a town
Blackness everywhere and little lights shine
Oh blackness blackness dragging me down
Come on light the candle in this poor heart of mine

Oh star bright star bright
You've got the lovin' that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight

I'm drinking sweet champagne
Got the headphones up high
Can't numb you out
Can't drum you out of my mind
They're playing Goodbye Baby
Baby Goodbye
Ooh ooh love is blind

Up go the flaps down go the wheels
I hope you got your heat turned on baby
I hope they finally fixed your automobile
I hope it's better when we meet again baby

Star bright star bright
You got the lovin' that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight

"River"

It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on

But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm going to make a lot of money
Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Whoa I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby cry

He tried hard to help me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby
That I ever had
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye

It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
Singing songs of joy and peace
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

"A Case Of You"

Just before our love got lost you said
"I am as constant as a northern star"
And I said, "Constantly in the darkness
Where's that at
If you want me I'll be in the bar"

On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh, Canada
With your face sketched on it twice

Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh, I would still be on my feet

Oh, I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid

I remember that time you told me
You said, "Love is touching souls"
Surely you touched mine
'Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time

Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
And still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds
And she said, "Go to him, stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed"

Oh, but you are in my blood
You're my holy wine
You're so bitter
Bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

"The Last Time I Saw Richard"

The last time I saw Richard was Detroit in '68
And he told me all romantics meet the same fate someday
Cynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark caf
"You laugh," he said, "You think you're immune
Go look at your eyes, they're full of moon
You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you
All those pretty lies, pretty lies
When you gonna realize they're only pretty lies
Only pretty lies, just pretty lies"

He put a quarter in the Wurlitzer
And he pushed three buttons and the thing began to whirr
And a bar maid came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie
And she said, "Drink up now it's gettin' on time to close"
"Richard you haven't really changed," I said
"It's just that now you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head
You got tombs in your eyes, but the songs you punched are dreaming
Listen, they sing of love so sweet, love so sweet
When you gonna get yourself back on your feet
Oh love can be so sweet, love so sweet."

Richard got married to a figure skater
And he bought her a dishwasher and a coffee percolator
And he drinks at home now most nights with the TV on
And all the house lights left up bright
I'm gonna blow this damn candle out
I don't want nobody comin' over to my table
I got nothing to talk to anybody about
All good dreamers pass this way some day
Hidin' behind bottles in dark cafs, dark cafs
Only a dark cocoon before I get my gorgeous wings and fly away
Only a phase, these dark caf days

"Banquet"

Come to the dinner gong
The table is laden high
Fat bellies and hungry little ones
Tuck your napkins in
And take your share
Some get the gravy
And some get the gristle
Some get the marrow bone
And some get nothing
Though there's plenty to spare

I took my share down by the sea
Paper plates and Javex bottles on the tide
Seagulls come down
And they squawk at me
Down where the water-skiers glide

Some turn to Jesus
And some turn to heroin
Some turn to rambling round
Looking for a clean sky
And a drinking stream
Some watch the paint peel off
Some watch their kids grow up
Some watch their stocks and bonds
Waiting for that big deal
American Dream

I took my dream down by the sea
Yankee yachts and lobster pots and sunshine
And logs and sails
And Shell Oil pails
Dogs and tugs and summertime
Back in the banquet line
Angry young people crying

Who let the greedy in
And who left the needy out
Who made this salty soup
Tell him we're very hungry now
For a sweeter fare
In the cookie I read
"Some get the gravy
And some get the gristle
Some get the marrow bone
And some get nothing
Though there's plenty to spare"

"Cold Blue Steel And Sweet Fire"

Cold Blue Steel out of money
One eye for the beat police
Sweet Fire calling
"You can't deny me
Now you know what you need"
Underneath the jungle gym
Hollow-grey fire-escape thief
Looking for Sweet Fire
Shadow of Lady Release

"Come with me
I know the way" she says
"It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first
Leave someone a letter
You can come now
Or you can come later"

A wristwatch, a ring, a downstairs screamer
Edgy - black cracks of the sky
"Pin-cushion prick
Fix this poor bad dreamer"
"Money" cold shadows reply
Pawnshops crisscrossed and padlocked
Corridors spit on prayers and pleas
Sparks fly up from Sweet Fire
Black soot of Lady Release

"Come with me
I know the way" she says
"It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first
Does it really matter
If you come now
Or if you come on later"

Red water in the bathroom sink
Fever and the scum brown bowl
Blue Steel still begging
But it's indistinct
Someone's HI-Fi drumming Jelly Roll
Concrete concentration camp
Bashing in veins for peace
Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire
Fall into Lady Release

"Come with me
I know the way" she says
"It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first
I mean what does it really matter
You're going to come now
Or you're going to come later"

"Barangrill"

Three waitresses all wearing
Black diamond earrings
Talking about zombies
And Singapore slings
No trouble in their faces
Not one anxious voice
None of the crazy you get
From too much choice
The thumb and the satchel
Or the rented Rolls-Royce
And you think she knows something
By the second refill
You think she's enlightened
As she totals your bill
You say "Show me the way
To Barangrill"

Well some say it's in service
They say "Humble Makes Pure"
You're hoping it's near Folly
'Cause you're headed that way for sure
And you just have to laugh
'Cause it's all so crazy
Ah, her mind's on her boyfriend
And eggs over easy
It's just a trick on you
Her mirrors and your will
So you ask the truck driver
On the way to the till
But he's just a slave
To Barangrill

The guy at the gas pumps
He's got a lot of soul
He sings Merry Christmas for you
Just like Nat King Cole
And he makes up his own tune
Right on the spot
About whitewalls and windshields
And this job he's got
And you want to get moving
And you want to stay still
But lost in the moment
Some longing gets filled
And you even forget to ask
"Hey, Where's Barangrill"

"Lesson In Survival"

Lesson in survival
Spinning out on turns
That gets you tough
Guru books, the Bible
Only a reminder
That you're just not good enough
You need to believe in something
Once I could in our love

Black road
Double yellow line
Friends and kin
Campers in the kitchen
That's fine sometimes
But I know my needs
My sweet tumbleweed
I need more quiet times
By a river flowing
You and me
Deep kisses
And the sun going down

Maybe it's paranoia
Maybe it's sensitivity
Your friends protect you
Scrutinize me
I get so damn timid
Not at all the spirit
That's inside of me
Oh baby I can't seem to make it
With you socially
There's this reef around me

I'm looking way out at the ocean
Love to see that green water in motion
I'm gonna get a boat
And we can row it
If you ever get the notion
To be needed by me
Fresh salmon frying
And the tide rolling in

I went to see a friend tonight
Was very late when I walked in
My talking as it rambled
Revealed suspicious reasoning
The visit seemed to darken him
I came in as bright
As a neon light
And I burned out
Right there before him

I told him these things
I'm telling you now
Watched them buckle up
In his brow

When you dig down deep
You lose good sleep
And it makes you
Heavy company
I will always love you
Hands alike
Magnet and iron
The souls

"Let The Wind Carry Me"

Papa's faith is people
Mama she believes in cleaning
Papa's faith is in people
Mama she's always cleaning
Papa brought home the sugar
Mama taught me the deeper meaning

She don't like my kick pleat skirt
She don't like my eyelids painted green
She don't like me staying up late
In my high-heeled shoes
Living for that rock 'n' roll dancing scene
Papa says "Leave the girl alone, mother
She's looking like a movie queen"

Mama thinks she spoilt me
Papa knows somehow he set me free
Mama thinks she spoilt me rotten
She blames herself
But papa he blesses me
It's a rough road to travel
Mama let go now
It's always called for me

Sometimes I get that feeling
And I want to settle
And raise a child up with somebody
I get that strong longing
And I want to settle
And raise a child up with somebody
But it passes like the summer
I'm a wild seed again
Let the wind carry me

"For The Roses"

I heard it in the wind last night 
It sounded like applause 
Did you get a round resounding for you 
Way up here 
It seems like many dim years ago 
Since I heard that face to face 
Or seen you face to face 
Though tonight I can feel you here 
I get these notes 
On butterflies and lilac sprays 
From girls who just have to tell me 
They saw you somewhere

In some office sits a poet 
And he trembles as he sings 
And he asks some guy 
To circulate his soul around 
On your mark red ribbon runner 
The caressing rev of motors 
Finely tuned like fancy women 
In thirties evening gowns 
Up the charts 
Off to the airport 
Your name's in the news 
Everything's first class 
The lights go down 
And it's just you up there 
Getting them to feel like that

Remember the days when you used to sit 
And make up your tunes for love 
And pour your simple sorrow 
To the soundhole and your knee 
And now you're seen 
On giant screens 
And at parties for the press 
And for people who have slices of you 
From the company 
They toss around your latest golden egg 
Speculation well who's to know 
If the next one in the nest 
Will glitter for them so

I guess I seem ungrateful 
With my teeth sunk in the hand 
That brings me things
I really can't give up just yet
Now I sit up here the critic
And they introduce some band 
But they seem so much confetti 
Looking at them on my TV set 
Oh the power and the glory 
Just when you're getting a taste for worship
They start bringing out the hammers 
And the boards
And the nails

I heard it in the wind last night 
It sounded like applause 
Chilly now 
End of summer 
No more shiny hot nights 
It was just the arbutus rustling 
And the bumping of the logs 
And the moon swept down black water 
Like an empty spotlight

"See You Sometime"

Where are you now
Are you in some hotel room
Does it have a view 
Are you caught in a crowd
Or holding some honey
Who came on to you 
Why do you have to be so jive
OK hang up the phone
It hurts
But something survives
Though it's undermined
I'd still like to see you sometime

I'm feeling so good
And my friends all tell me
That I'm looking fine
I run in the woods
I spring from the boulders
Like a mama lion
I'm not ready to
Change my name again
But you know I'm not after
A piece of your fortune
And your fame
'Cause I tasted mine
I'd just like to see you sometime

Pack your suspenders
I'll come meet your plane
No need to surrender
I just want to see you again

We're in for more rain
I could sure use some sunshine on my apple trees
It seems such a shame
We start out so kind and end so heartlessly
I couldn't take them all on then
With a headful of questions and hypes
So when the hopes got so slim
I just resigned
But I'd still like to see you sometime
I'd sure like to see you

"Electricity"

The Minus is loveless
He talks to the land
And the leaves fall
And the pond over-ices
She don't know the system, Plus
She don't understand
She's got all the wrong fuses and splices
She's not going to fix it up
Too easy

The masking tape tangles
It's sticky and black
And the copper
Proud headed Queen Lizzie
Conducts little charges
That don't get charged back
Well the technical manual's busy
She's not going to fix it up too easy
And she holds out her flashlight
And she shines it on me
She wants me to tell her
What the trouble might be
Well I'm learning
It's peaceful
With a good dog and some trees
Out of touch with the breakdown
Of this century
They're not going to fix it up
Too easy

We once loved-together
And we floodlit that time
Input-output-electricity
But the lines overloaded
And the sparks started flying
And the loose wires
Were lashing out at me
She's not going to fix that up
Too easy
But she holds out her candle
And she shines it in
And she begs him to show her
How to fix it again
While the song that he sang her
To soothe her to sleep
Runs all through her circuits
Like a heartbeat
She's not going to fix it up
Too easy

"You Turn Me On I'm A Radio"

If you're driving into town
With a dark cloud above you
Dial in the number
Who's bound to love you

Oh honey you turn me on
I'm a radio
I'm a country station
I'm a little bit corny
I'm a wildwood flower
Waving for you
Broadcasting tower
Waving for you

And I'm sending you out
This signal here
I hope you can pick it up
Loud and clear

I know you don't like weak women
You get bored so quick
And you don't like strong women
'Cause they're hip to your tricks

It's been dirty for dirty
Down the line
But you know I come when you whistle
When you're loving and kind

But if you've got too many doubts
If there's no good reception for me
Then tune me out, 'cause honey
Who needs the static

It hurts the head
And you wind up cracking
And the day goes dismal
From "Breakfast Barney"
To the sign-off prayer
What a sorry face you get to wear
I'm going to tell you again now
If you're still listening there

If you're driving into town
With a dark cloud above you
Dial in the number
Who's bound to love you

If you're lying on the beach
With the transistor going
Kick off the sandflies honey
The love's still flowing
If your head says forget it
But your heart's still smoking
Call me at the station
The lines are open

"Blonde In The Bleachers"

The blonde in the bleachers
She flips her hair for you
Above the loudspeakers
You start to fall

She follows you home
But you miss living alone
You can still hear sweet mysteries
Calling you

The bands and the roadies
Lovin' 'em and leavin' 'em
It's pleasure to try 'em
It's trouble to keep 'em

'Cause it seems like you've gotta give up
Such a piece of your soul
When you give up the chase
Feeling it hot and cold
You're in rock 'n' roll
It's the nature of the race
It's the unknown child
So sweet and wild
It's youth
It's too good to waste

She tapes her regrets
To the microphone stand
She says "You can't hold the hand
Of a rock 'n' roll man
Very long
Or count on your plans
With a rock 'n' roll man
Very long
Compete with the fans
For your rock 'n' roll man
For very long
The girls and the bands
And the rock 'n' roll man"

"Woman Of Heart And Mind"

I am a woman of heart and mind
With time on her hands
No child to raise
You come to me like a little boy
And I give you my scorn and my praise
You think I'm like your mother
Or another lover or your sister
Or the queen of your dreams
Or just another silly girl
When love makes a fool of me

After the rush when you come back down
You're always disappointed
Nothing seems to keep you high
Drive your bargains
Push your papers
Win your medals
Fuck your strangers
Don't it leave you on the empty side
I'm looking for affection and respect
A little passion
And you want stimulation-nothing more
That's what I think
But you know I'll try to be there for you
When your spirits start to sink

All this talk about holiness now
It must be the start of the latest style
Is it all books and words
Or do you really feel it
Do you really laugh
Do you really care
Do you really smile
When you smile
You criticize and you flatter
You imitate the best
And the rest you memorize
You know the times you impress me most
Are the times when you don't try
When you don't even try

"Judgement Of The Moon And Stars (Ludwig's Tune)"

No tongue in the bell
And the fishwives yell
But they might as well be mute
So you get to keep the pictures
That don't seem like much
Cold white keys under your fingers
Now you're thinking
"That's no substitute
It just don't do it
Like the song of a warm warm body
Loving your touch"

In the court they carve your legend
With an apple in its jaw
And the women that you wanted
They get their laughs
Long silk stockings
On the bedposts of refinement
You're too raw
They think you're too raw
It's the judgement of the moon and stars
Your solitary path
Draw yourself a bath
Think what you'd like to have
For supper
Or take a walk
A park
A bridge
A tree
A river
Revoked but not yet cancelled
The gift goes on
In silence
In a bell jar
Still a song

You've got to shake your fists at lightning now
You've got to roar like forest fire
You've got to spread your light like blazes
All across the sky
They're going to aim the hoses on you
Show 'em you won't expire
Not till you burn up every passion
Not even when you die
Come on now
You've got to try
If you're feeling contempt
Well then you tell it
If you're tired of the silent night
Jesus well then you yell it
Condemned to wires and hammers
Strike every chord that you feel
That broken trees
And elephant ivories conceal

"Court And Spark"

Love came to my door with a sleeping roll
And a madman's soul
He thought for sure I'd seen him
Dancing up a river in the dark
Looking for a woman to court and spark

He was playing on the sidewalk for passing change
When something strange happened
Glory train passed through him
So he buried the coins he made in People's Park
And went looking for a woman to court and spark

It seemed like he read my mind
He saw me mistrusting him and still acting kind
He saw how I worried sometimes
I worry sometimes

All the guilty people, he said, they've all seen the stain
On their daily bread
On their Christian names
I cleared myself, I sacrificed my blues
And you could complete me, I'd complete you

His eyes were the colour of the sand and the sea
And the more he talked to me, you know
The more he reached me
But I couldn't let go of L.A.
City of the fallen angels

"Help Me"

Help me
I think I'm falling
In love again
When I get that crazy feeling
I know I'm in trouble again
I'm in trouble
'Cause you're a rambler and a gambler
And a sweet talking ladies man
And you love your lovin'
But not like you love your freedom

Help me
I think I'm falling
In love too fast
It's got me hoping for the future
And worrying about the past
'Cause I've seen some hot, hot blazes
Come down to smoke and ash
We love our lovin'
But not like we love our freedom

Didn't it feel good
We were sitting there talking
Or lying there not talking
Didn't it feel good
You dance with the lady
With the hole in her stocking
Didn't it feel good
Didn't it feel good

Help me
I think I'm falling
In love with you
Are you going to let me go there by myself
That's such a lonely thing to do
Both of us flirting around
Flirting and flirting
Hurting too
We love our lovin'
But not like we love our freedom

"Free Man In Paris"

The way I see it, he said, you just can't win it
Everybody's in it for their own gain
You can't please 'em all
There's always somebody calling you down
I do my best and I do good business
There's a lot of people asking for my time
They're trying to get ahead
They're trying to be a good friend of mine

I was a free man in Paris
I felt unfettered and alive
There was nobody calling me up for favors
And no one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star-maker machinery 
Behind the popular song

I deal in dreamers and telephone screamers
Lately I wonder what I do it for
If I had my way
I'd just walk through those doors
And wander down the Champs-lyses 
Going caf to cabaret
Thinking how I'll feel when I find 
That very good friend of mine

I was a free man in Paris
I felt unfettered and alive
Nobody was calling me up for favors
No one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star-maker machinery
Behind the popular song

"People's Parties"

All the people at this party
They've got a lot of style
They've got stamps of many countries
They've got passport smiles
Some are friendly
Some are cutting
Some are watching it from the wings
Some are standing in the centre
Giving to get something

Photo beauty gets attention
Then her eye paint's running down
She's got a rose in her teeth
And a lampshade crown
One minute she's so happy
Then she's crying on someone's knee
Saying laughing and crying
You know it's the same release

I told you when I met you
I was crazy
Cry for us all, beauty
Cry for Eddie in the corner
Thinking he's nobody
And Jack behind his joker
And stone-cold Grace behind her fan
And me in my frightened silence
Thinking I don't understand

I feel like I'm sleeping
Can you wake me
You seem to have a broader sensibility
I'm just living on nerves and feelings
With a weak and a lazy mind
And coming to peoples parties
Fumbling deaf dumb and blind

I wish I had more sense of humour
Keeping the sadness at bay
Throwing the lightness on these things

Laughing it all away
Laughing it all away
Laughing it all away
Laughing it all away

"Same Situation"

Again and again the same situation
For so many years
Tethered to a ringing telephone
In a room full of mirrors
A pretty girl in your bathroom
Checking out her sex appeal
I asked myself when you said you loved me
Do you think this can be real

Still I sent up my prayer
Wondering where it had to go
With heaven full of astronauts
And the Lord on death row
While the millions of his lost and lonely ones
Call out and clamour to be found
Caught in their struggle for higher positions
And their search for love that sticks around

You've had lots of lovely women
Now you turn your gaze to me
Weighing the beauty and the imperfection
To see if I'm worthy
Like the church
Like a cop
Like a mother
You want me to be truthful
Sometimes you turn it on me like a weapon though
And I need your approval

Still I sent up my prayer
Wondering who was there to hear
I said send me somebody
Who's strong and somewhat sincere
With the millions of the lost and lonely ones
I called out to be released
Caught in my struggle for higher achievements
And my search for love
That don't seem to cease

"Car On A Hill"

I've been sitting up waiting for my sugar to show
I've been listening to the sirens and the radio
(Listening to the sirens and the radio)
He said he'd be over three hours ago
I've been waitin' for his car on the hill
(Waitin' for his car on the hill)

He makes friends easy
He's not like me
I watch for judgment anxiously
Now where in the city can that boy be
Waitin' for a car
Climbin', climbin'
Climbin' the hill

He's a real good talker
I think he's a friend
Fast tires come screaming around the bend
(Fast tires come screaming around the bend)
But there's still no buzzer
They roll on
And I'm waitin' for his car on the hill
(Waitin' for a car on the hill)

It always seems so righteous at the start
When there's so much laughter
When there's so much spark
When there's so much sweetness in the dark
Waitin' for a car
Climbin', climbin'
Climbin' the hill

"Down To You"

Everything comes and goes
Marked by lovers and styles of clothes
Things that you held high
And told yourself were true
Lost or changing as the days come down to you
Down to you
Constant stranger
You're a kind person
You're a cold person too
It's down to you

You go down to the pick up station
Craving warmth and beauty
You settle for less than fascination
A few drinks later you're not so choosy
When the closing lights strip off the shadows
On this strange new flesh you've found
Clutching the night to you like a fig leaf
You hurry
To the blackness
And the blankets
To lay down an impression
And your loneliness

In the morning there are lovers in the street
They look so high
You brush against a stranger
And you both apologize
Old friends seem indifferent
You must have brought that on
Old bonds have broken down
Love is gone
Oooh love is gone
Written on your spirit this sad song
Love is gone

Everything comes and goes
Pleasure moves on too early
And trouble leaves too slow
Just when you're thinking
You've finally got it made
Bad news comes knocking
At your garden gate
Knocking for you
Constant stranger
You're a brute you're an angel
You can crawl you can fly too
It's down to you
It all comes down to you

"Just Like This Train"

I'm always running behind the time
Just like this train
Shaking into town
With the brakes complainin'

I used to count lovers like railroad cars
I counted them on my side
Lately I don't count on nothing
I just let things slide

The station master's shuffling cards
Boxcars are banging in the yards
Jealous loving'll make you crazy
If you can't find your goodness
'Cause you lost your heart

I went looking for a cause
Or a strong cat without claws
Or any reason to resume
And I found this empty seat
In this crowded waiting room
Everybody waiting

Old man sleeping on his bags
Women with that teased up kind of hair
Kids with the jitters in their legs
And those wide wide open stares
And the kids got cokes and chocolate bars
There's a thin man smoking a fat cigar
Jealous loving'll make you crazy
If you can't find your goodness
'Cause you've lost your heart

What are you going to do now
You've got no one to give your love to

Well I've got this berth and this roll down blind
I've got this fold up sink
And these rocks 
And these cactus going by
And a bottle of German wine to drink
Settle down into the clickety clack
With the clouds and the stars to read
Dreaming of the pleasure I'm gonna have
Watching your hairline recede, my vain darling

Watching your hair and clouds and stars
I'm rocking away in a sleeping car
This jealous loving's bound to make me crazy
I can't find my goodness
I lost my heart
Oh sour grapes
Because I lost my heart

"Raised On Robbery"

He was sitting in the lounge of the Empire Hotel
He was drinking for diversion, he was thinking for himself
A little money riding on the Maple Leafs
Along comes a lady in lacy sleeves
She says, let me sit down, you know drinking alone's a shame, it's a shame, it's a crying shame
Look at those jokers glued to that damn hockey game
Hey honey, you've got lots of cash
Bring us down a bottle and we'll have some laughs
Gin's what I'm drinking, I was raised on robbery

I'm a pretty good cook, sitting on my groceries
Come up to my kitchen, I'll show you my best recipe
I try and I try but I can't save a cent
I'm up after midnight cooking, trying to make my rent
I'm rough but I'm pleasing, I was raised on robbery

We had a little money once, they were pushing through a four-lane highway
Government gave us three thousand dollars, you should have seen it fly away
First he bought a '57 Biscayne, he put it in the ditch
He drunk up all the rest, that son of a bitch
His blood's bad whiskey, I was raised on robbery

You know you ain't bad looking, I like the way you hold your drinks
Come home with me honey, I ain't asking for no full-length mink
Hey, where you going, don't go yet
Your glass ain't empty and we just met
You're mean when you're loaded, I was raised on robbery

"Trouble Child"

Up in a sterilized room
Where they let you be lazy
Knowing your attitude's all wrong
And you got to change
And that's not easy
Dragon shining with all values known
Dazzling you-keeping you from your own
Where is the lion in you to defy him
When you're this weak
And this spacey...

So what are you going to do about it
You can't live life and you can't leave it
Advice and religion-you can't take it
You can't seem to believe it
The peacock is afraid to parade
You're under the thumb of the maid
You really can't give love in this condition
Still you know how you need it

They open and close you
Then they talk like they know you
They don't know you
They're friends and they're foes too
Trouble child
Breaking like the waves at Malibu

So why does it come as such a shock
To know you really have no one
Only a river of changing faces
Looking for an ocean
They trickle through your leaky plans
Another dream over the dam
And you're lying in some room
Feeling like your right to be human
Is going over too
Well some are going to knock you
And some'll try to clock you
You know it's really hard
To talk sense to you
Trouble child
Breaking like the waves at Malibu

"Twisted"

My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head
The way he described it
He said I'd be better dead than live
I didn't listen to his jive
I knew all along
That he was all wrong
And I knew that he thought
I was crazy but I'm not
Oh no

My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head
He said I'd need treatment
But I'm not that easily led
He said I was the type
That was most inclined
When out of his sight
To be out of my mind
And he thought I was nuts
No more ifs or ands or buts

They say as a child
I appeared a little bit wild
With all my crazy ideas
But I knew what was happening
I knew I was a genius
What's so strange when you know
That you're a wizard at three
I knew that this was meant to be

Now I heard little children
Were supposed to sleep tight
That's why I got into the vodka one night
My parents got frantic
Didn't know what to do
But I saw some crazy scenes
Before I came to
Now do you think I was crazy
I may have been only three
But I was swinging

They all laugh at angry young men
They all laugh at Edison
And also at Einstein
So why should I feel sorry
If they just couldn't understand
The idiomatic logic
That went on in my head
I had a brain
It was insane
Oh they used to laugh at me
When I refused to ride
On all those double-decker buses
All because there was no driver on the top

(What No driver on the top)
(Man, the chick is twisted. Crazy ... should be. Here ... flip city.)

My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head
But I said dear doctor
I think that it's you instead
Because I have got a thing
That's unique and new
To prove it I'll have
The last laugh on you
'Cause instead of one head
I got two
And you know two heads are better than one

"In France They Kiss On Main Street"

Downtown
My darling dime store thief
In the War of Independence
Rock 'n' roll rang sweet as victory
Under neon signs
A girl was in bloom
And a woman was fading 
In a suburban room
I said take me to the dance
Do you want to dance
I love to dance
And I told him 
They don't take chances
They seem so removed from romance
They've been broken in churches and schools
And molded to middle class circumstance
And we were rollin'
Rollin'
Rock 'n' rollin'

Downtown
The dance halls and cafes
Feel so wild you could break somebody's heart
Just doing the latest dance craze
Gail and Louise
In those push up brassieres
Tight dresses and rhinestone rings
Drinking up the band's beers
Young love was kissing under bridges
Kissing in cars 
Kissing in cafes
And we were walking down Main Street
Kisses like bright flags hung on holidays
In France they kiss on Main Street
Amour, mama, not cheap display
And we were rollin'
Rollin'
Rock 'n' rollin'

Downtown
In the pinball arcade
With his head full of pool hall pitches
And songs from the hit parade
He'd be singing "Bye, Bye, Love"
While he's racking up his free play
Let those rock 'n' roll choir boys
Come and carry us away
Sometimes Chickie had the car
Or Ron had a car
Or Lead Foot Melvin with his hotwire head
We'd all go looking for a party
Looking to raise Jesus up from the dead
And I'd be kissing in the back seat
Thrilling to the Brando-like things that he said
And we'd be rollin'
Rollin'
Rock 'n' rolling

Rollin'
Rollin'
Rock 'n' rollin'

Rollin'
Rollin'
Rock 'n' rollin'

"The Jungle Line"

Rousseau walks on trumpet paths
Safaris to the heart of all that jazz
Through I-bars and girders, through wires and pipes
The mathematic circuits of the modern nights
Through huts, through Harlem, through jails and gospel pews
Through the class on Park and the trash on Vine
Through Europe and the deep deep heart of Dixie blue
Through savage progress cuts the jungle line

In a low-cut blouse she brings the beer
Rousseau paints a jungle flower behind her ear
Those cannibals-of shuck and jive
They'll eat a working girl like her alive
With his hard-edged eye and his steady hand
He paints the cellar full of ferns and orchid vines
And he hangs a moon above a five-piece band
He hangs it up above the jungle line

The jungle line, the jungle line
Screaming in a ritual of sound and time
Floating, drifting on the air-conditioned wind
And drooling for a taste of something smuggled in
Pretty women funneled through valves and smoke
Coy and bitchy, wild and fine
And charging elephants and chanting slaving boats
Charging, chanting down the jungle line

There's a poppy wreath on a soldier's tomb
There's a poppy snake in a dressing room
Poppy poison-poppy tourniquet
It slithers away on brass like mouthpiece spit
And metal skin and ivory birds
Go steaming up to Rousseau's vines
They go steaming up to Brooklyn Bridge
Steaming, steaming, steaming up the jungle line

"Edith And The Kingpin"

The big man arrives
Disco dancers greet him
Plainclothes cops greet him
Small town, big man, fresh lipstick glistening
Sophomore jive
From victims of typewriters
The band sounds like typewriters
The big man he's not listening
His eyes hold Edith
His left hand holds his right
What does that hand desire
That he grips it so tight

Edith in the ring
The passed-over girls are conferring
The man with the diamond ring is purring
All claws for now withdrawn
One by one they bring
His renegade stories to her
His crimes and his glories to her
In challenge they look on
Women he has taken grow old too soon
He tilts their tired faces
Gently to the spoon

Edith in his bed
A plane in the rain is humming
The wires in the walls are humming
Some song some mysterious song
Bars in her head
Beating frantic and snowblind
Romantic and snowblind
She says his crime belongs
Edith and the Kingpin
Each with charm to sway
Are staring eye to eye
They dare not look away
You know they dare not look away

"Don't Interrupt The Sorrow"

Don't interrupt the sorrow
Darn right
In flames our prophet witches
Be polite
A room full of glasses
He says "Your notches, liberation doll"
And he chains me with that serpent
To that Ethiopian wall

Anima rising
Queen of Queens
Wash my guilt of Eden
Wash and balance me
Anima rising
Uprising in me tonight
She's a vengeful little goddess
With an ancient crown to fight

Truth goes up in vapors
The steeples lean
Winds of change patriarchs
Snug in your bible belt dreams
God goes up the chimney
Like childhood Santa Claus
The good slaves love the good book
A rebel loves a cause

I'm leaving on the 115
You're darn right
Since I was seventeen
I've had no one over me
He says "Anima rising
So what
Petrified wood process
Tall timber down to rock"

Don't interrupt the sorrow
Darn right
He says "We walked on the moon
You be polite"
Don't let up the sorrow
Death and birth and death and birth and death and birth
He says "Bring that bottle kindly
And I'll pad your purse
I've got a head full of quandary
And a mighty mighty mighty thirst"

Seventeen glasses
Rhine wine
Milk of the Madonna
Clandestine
He don't let up the sorrow
He lies and he cheats
It takes a heart like Mary's these days
When your man gets weak

"Shades Of Scarlett Conquering"

Out of the fire like Catholic saints
Comes Scarlett and her deep complaint
Mimicking tenderness she sees
In sentimental movies
A celluloid rider comes to town
Cinematic lovers sway
Plantations and sweeping ballroom gowns
Take her breath away

Out in the wind in crinolines
Chasing the ghosts of Gable and Flynn
Through stand-in boys and extra players
Magnolias hopeful in her auburn hair
She comes from a school of southern charm
She likes to have things her way
Any man in the world holding out his arm
Would soon be made to pay

Friends have told her "Not so proud"
Neighbors trying to sleep and yelling "Not so loud"

Lovers in anger "Block Of Ice"
Harder and harder just to be nice
Given in the night to dark dreams
From the dark things she feels
She covers her eyes in the x-rated scenes
Running from the reels

Beauty and madness to be praised
'Cause it is not easy to be brave
To walk around in so much need
To carry the weight of all that greed
Dressed in stolen clothes she stands
Cast iron and frail
With her impossibly gentle hands
And her blood-red fingernails

Out of the fire and still smoldering
She says "A woman must have everything"
Shades of Scarlett Conquering
She says "A woman must have everything"

"The Hissing Of Summer Lawns"

He bought her a diamond for her throat
He put her in a ranch house on a hill
She could see the valley barbecues
From her window sill
See the blue pools in the squinting sun
Hear the hissing of summer lawns

He put up a barbed wire fence
To keep out the unknown
And on every metal thorn
Just a little blood of his own
She patrols that fence of his
To a latin drum
And the hissing of summer lawns
Darkness
Wonder makes it easy
Darkness
With a joyful mask
Darkness
Tube's gone, darkness, darkness, darkness
No color no contrast

A diamond dog
Carrying a cup and a cane
Looking through a double glass
Looking at too much pride and too much shame
There's a black fly buzzing
There's a heat wave burning in her master's voice
Hissing summer lawns

He gave her his darkness to regret
And good reason to quit him
He gave her a roomful of Chippendale
That nobody sits in
Still she stays with a love of some kind
It's the lady's choice
The hissing of summer lawns

"The Boho Dance"

Down in the cellar in the Boho zone
I went looking for some sweet inspiration, oh well
Just another hard-time band
With Negro affectations
I was a hopeful in rooms like this
When I was working cheap
It's an old romance the Boho dance
It hasn't gone to sleep

But even on the scuffle
The cleaner's press was in my jeans
And any eye for detail
Caught a little lace along the seams

And you were in the parking lot
Subterranean by your own design
The virtue of your style inscribed
On your contempt for mine
Jesus was a beggar, he was rich in grace
And Solomon kept his head in all his glory
It's just that some steps outside the Boho dance
Have a fascination for me

A camera pans the cocktail hour
Behind a blind of potted palms
And finds a lady in a Paris dress
With runs in her nylons

You read those books where luxury
Comes as a guest to take a slave
Books where artists in noble poverty
Go like virgins to the grave
Don't you get sensitive on me
'Cause I know you're just too proud
You couldn't step outside the Boho dance now
Even if good fortune allowed

Like a priest with a pornographic watch
Looking and longing on the sly
Sure it's stricken from your uniform
But you can't get it out of your eyes

Nothing is capsulized in me
On either side of town
The streets were never really mine
Not mine these glamour gowns

"Harry's House-Centerpiece"

Heatwaves on the runway
As the wheels set down
He takes his baggage off the carousel
He takes a taxi into town
Yellow schools of taxi fishes
Jonah in a ticking whale
Caught up at the light in the fishnet windows of Bloomingdale's
Watching those high fashion girls
Skinny black models with raven curls
Beauty parlor blondes with credit card eyes
Looking for the chic and the fancy to buy

He opens up his suitcase
In the continental suite
And people thirty stories down
Look like colored currents in the street
A helicopter lands on the Pan Am roof
Like a dragonfly on a tomb
And business men in button downs
Press into conference rooms
Battalions of paper-minded males
Talking commodities and sales
While at home their paper wives
And paper kids
Paper the walls to keep their gut reactions hid

Yellow checkers for the kitchen
Climbing ivy for the bath
She is lost in House and Gardens
He's caught up in Chief of Staff
He drifts off into the memory
Of the way she looked in school
With her body oiled and shining
At the public swimming pool ...

The more I'm with you, pretty baby
The more I feel my love increase
I'm building all my dreams around you
Our happiness will never cease
'Cause nothing's any good without you
Baby you're my centerpiece

We'll find a house and garden somewhere
Along a country road a piece
A little cottage on the outskirts
Where we can really find release
'Cause nothing's any good without you
Baby you're my centerpiece

(When we be home Harry)
(Get down of the boat)
((Well, I'm sure sick of that so far))
(When we be home Harry)
(I said get down off of there)
((Nothing's any good))
(When we be home Harry)
(Nothing's any good)

Shining hair and shining skin
Shining as she reeled him in
To tell him like she did today
Just what he could do with Harry's House
And Harry's take home pay

"Sweet Bird"

Out on some borderline
Some mark of in-between
I lay down golden in time
And woke up vanishing

Sweet bird you are
Briefer than a falling star
All these vain promises on beauty jars
Somewhere with your wings on time
You must be laughing
Behind our eyes
Calendars of our lives
Circled with compromise
Sweet bird of time and change
You must be laughing
Up on your feathers laughing

Golden in time
Cities under the sand
Power ideals and beauty
Fading in everyone's hand

Give me some time
I feel like I'm losing mine
Out here on this horizon line
With the earth spinning
And the sky forever rushing
No one knows
They can never get that close
Guesses at most
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching

"Shadows And Light"

Every picture has its shadows
And it has some source of light
Blindness, blindness and sight
The perils of benefactors
The blessings of parasites
Blindness, blindness and sight
Threatened by all things
Devil of cruelty
Drawn to all things
Devil of delight
Mythical devil of the ever-present laws
Governing blindness, blindness and sight

Suntans in reservation dining rooms
Pale miners in their lantern rays
Night, night and day
Hostage smile on presidents
Freedom scribbled in the subway
It's like night, night and day
Threatened by all things
God of cruelty
Drawn to all things
God of delight
Mythical god of the everlasting laws
Governing day, day and night

Critics of all expression
Judges in black and white
Saying it's wrong, saying it's right
Compelled by prescribed standards
Or some ideals we fight
For wrong, wrong and right
Threatened by all things
Man of cruelty-mark of Cain
Drawn to all things
Man of delight-born again, born again
Man of the laws, the ever-broken laws
Governing wrong, wrong and right
Governing wrong, wrong and right
Wrong and right

"Coyote"

No regrets Coyote
We just come from such different sets of circumstance
I'm up all night in the studios
And you're up early on your ranch
You'll be brushing out a brood mare's tail
While the sun is ascending
And I'll just be getting home with my reel to reel
There's no comprehending
Just how close to the bone and the skin and the eyes
And the lips you can get
And still feel so alone
And still feel related
Like stations in some relay
You're not a hit and run driver
No no
Racing away

You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

We saw a farmhouse burning down
In the middle of nowhere
In the middle of the night
And we rolled right past that tragedy
Till we turned into some road house lights
Where a local band was playing
Locals were up kicking and shaking on the floor
And the next thing I know
That coyote's at my door
He pins me in a corner and he won't take no
He drags me out on the dance floor
And we're dancing close and slow
Now he's got a woman at home
He's got another woman down the hall
He seems to want me anyway
Why'd you have to get so drunk
And lead me on that way

You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

I looked a coyote right in the face
On the road to Baljennie near my old home town
He went running through the whisker wheat
Chasing some prize down
And a hawk was playing with him
Coyote was jumping straight up and making passes
He had those same eyes just like yours
Under your dark glasses
Privately probing the public rooms
And peeking through keyholes in numbered doors
Where the players lick their wounds
And take their temporary lovers
And their pills and powders to get them through this passion play
No regrets Coyote
I'll just get off up aways

You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

Coyote's in the coffee shop
He's staring a hole in his scrambled eggs
He picks up my scent on his fingers
While he's watching the waitresses' legs
He's too far from the Bay of Fundy
From appaloosas and eagles and tides
And the air conditioned cubicles
And the carbon ribbon rides
Are spelling it out so clear
Either he's going to have to stand and fight
Or take off out of here
I tried to run away myself
To run away and wrestle with my ego
And with this flame
You put here in this Eskimo
In this hitcher
In this prisoner
Of the fine white lines
Of the white lines on the free free way

"Amelia"

I was driving across the burning desert
When I spotted six jet planes
Leaving six white vapor trails across the bleak terrain
It was the hexagram of the heavens
It was the strings of my guitar
Amelia it was just a false alarm

The drone of flying engines
Is a song so wild and blue
It scrambles time and seasons if it gets through to you
Then your life becomes a travelogue
Of picture post card charms
Oh Amelia it was just a false alarm

People'll tell you where they've gone
They'll tell you where to go
But till you get there yourself you never really know
Where some have found their paradise
Others just come to harm
Oh Amelia it was just a false alarm

I wish that he was here tonight
It's so hard to obey
His sad request of me to kindly stay away
So this is how I hide the hurt
As the road leads cursed and charmed
I tell Amelia it was just a false alarm

A ghost of aviation
She was swallowed by the sky
Or by the sea like me she had a dream to fly
Like Icarus ascending
On beautiful foolish arms
Amelia it was just a false alarm

Maybe I've never really loved
I guess that is the truth
I've spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitudes
And looking down on everything
I crashed into his arms
Amelia it was just a false alarm

I pulled into the Cactus Tree Motel
To shower off the dust
And I slept on the strange pillows of my wanderlust
I dreamed of 747s
Over geometric farms
Dreams Amelia
Dreams and false alarms

"Furry Sings The Blues"

Old Beale Street is coming down
Sweeties' Snack Bar boarded up now
And Egles The Tailor and the Shine Boy's gone
Faded out with ragtime blues
Handy's cast in bronze
And he's standing in a little park
With a trumpet in his hand
Like he's listening back to the good old bands
And the click of high heeled shoes
Old Furry sings the blues
Propped up in his bed
With his dentures and his leg removed
And Ginny's there
For her kindness and Furry's beer
She's the old man's angel overseer

Pawn shops glitter like gold tooth caps
In the grey decay
They chew the last few dollars off
Old Beale Street's carcass
Carrion and mercy
Blue and silver sparkling drums
Cheap guitars, eye shades and guns
Aimed at the hot blood of being no one
Down and out in Memphis Tennessee
Old Furry sings the blues
You bring him smoke and drink and he'll play for you
It's mostly muttering now and sideshow spiel
But there was one song he played
I could really feel

(But he's got nobody
Old Furry's got nobody)

There's a double bill murder at the New Daisy
The old girl's silent across the street
She's silent  waiting for the wrecker's beat
Silent  staring at her stolen name
Diamond boys and satin dolls
Bourbon laughter- ghosts  history falls
To parking lots and shopping malls
As they tear down old Beale Street
Old Furry sings the blues
He points a bony finger at you and says
"I don't like you"
Everybody laughs as if it's the old man's standard joke
But it's true
We're only welcome for our drink and smoke

W.C. Handy I'm rich and I'm fey
And I'm not familiar with what you played
But I get such strong impressions of your hey day
Looking up and down old Beale Street
Ghosts of the darktown society
Come right out of the bricks at me
Like it's a Saturday night
They're in their finery
Dancing it up and making deals
Furry sings the blues
Why should I expect that old guy to give it to me true
Fallen to hard luck
And time and other thieves
While our limo is shining on his shanty street
Old Furry sings the blues

"A Strange Boy"

A strange boy is weaving
A course of grace and havoc
On a yellow skateboard
Thru midday sidewalk traffic
Just when I think he's foolish and childish
And I want him to be manly
I catch my fool and my child
Needing love and understanding

What a strange, strange boy
He still lives with his family
Even the war and the navy
couldn't bring him to maturity

He keeps referring back to school days
And clinging to his child
Fidgeting and bullied
His crazy wisdom holding onto something wild
He asked me to be patient
Well I failed
"Grow up" I cried
And as the smoke was clearing he said
"Give me one good reason why"

What a strange, strange boy
He sees the cars as sets of waves
Sequences of mass and space
He sees the damage in my face

We got high on travel
And we got drunk on alcohol
And on love the strongest poison and medicine of all
See how that feeling comes and goes
Like the pull of moon on tides
Now I am surf rising
Now parched ribs of sand at his side

What a strange, strange boy
I gave him clothes and jewelry
I gave him my warm body
I gave him power over me

A thousand glass eyes were staring
In a cellar full of antique dolls
I found an old piano
And sweet chords rose up in waxed New England halls
While the boarders were snoring
Under crisp white sheets of curfew
We were newly lovers then
We were fire in the stiff blue-haired house rules

"Hejira"

I'm travelling in some vehicle
I'm sitting in some cafe
A defector from the petty wars
That shell shock love away
There's comfort in melancholy
When there's no need to explain
It's just as natural as the weather
In this moody sky today
In our possessive coupling
So much could not be expressed
So now I'm returning to myself
These things that you and I suppressed
I see something of myself in everyone
Just at this moment of the world
As snow gathers like bolts of lace
Waltzing on a ballroom girl

You know it never has been easy
Whether you do or you do not resign
Whether you travel the breadth of extremities
Or stick to some straighter line
Now here's a man and a woman sitting on a rock
They're either going to thaw out or freeze
Listen...
Strains of Benny Goodman
Coming through the snow and the pinewood trees
I'm porous with travel fever
But you know I'm so glad to be on my own
Still somehow the slightest touch of a stranger
Can set up trembling in my bones
I know - no one's going to show me everything
We all come and go unknown
Each so deep and superficial
Between the forceps and the stone

Well I looked at the granite markers
Those tribute to finality - to eternity
And then I looked at myself here
Chicken scratching for my immortality
In the church they light the candles
And the wax rolls down like tears
There's the hope and the hopelessness
I've witnessed thirty years
We're only particles of change I know, I know
Orbiting around the sun
But how can I have that point of view
When I'm always bound and tied to someone
White flags of winter chimneys
Waving truce against the moon
In the mirrors of a modern bank
From the window of a hotel room

I'm travelling in some vehicle
I'm sitting in some cafe
A defector from the petty wars
Until love sucks me back that way

"Song For Sharon"

I went to Staten Island, Sharon
To buy myself a mandolin
And I saw the long white dress of love
On a storefront mannequin
Big boat chuggin' back with a belly full of cars
All for something lacy
Some girl's going to see that dress
And crave that day like crazy

Little Indian kids on a bridge up in Canada
They can balance and they can climb
Like their fathers before them
They'll walk the girders of the Manhattan skyline
Shine your light on me Miss Liberty
Because as soon as this ferry boat docks
I'm headed to the church
To play Bingo
Fleece me with the gamblers' flocks

I can keep my cool at poker
But I'm a fool when love's at stake
Because I can't conceal emotion
What I'm feeling's always written on my face
There's a gypsy down on Bleecker Street
I went in to see her as a kind of joke
And she lit a candle for my love luck
And eighteen bucks went up in smoke

Sharon, I left my man
At a North Dakota junction
And I came out to the "Big Apple" here
To face the dream's malfunction
Love's a repetitious danger
You'd think I'd be accustomed to
Well, I do accept the changes
At least better than I used to do

A woman I knew just drowned herself
The well was deep and muddy
She was just shaking off futility
Or punishing somebody
My friends were calling up all day yesterday
All emotions and abstractions
It seems we all live so close to that line
And so far from satisfaction

Dora says, "Have children"
Mama and Betsy say, "Find yourself a charity."
Help the needy and the crippled or put some time into ecology."
Well, there's a wide wide world of noble causes
And lovely landscapes to discover
But all I really wanna do right now
Is...find another lover

When we were kids in Maidstone, Sharon
I went to every wedding in that little town
To see the tears and the kisses
And the pretty lady in the white lace wedding gown
And walking home on the railroad tracks
Or swinging on the playground swing
Love stimulated my illusions
More than anything

And when I went skating after Golden Reggie
You know it was white lace I was chasing
Chasing dreams
Mama's nylons underneath my cowgirl jeans
He showed me first you get the kisses
And then you get the tears
But the ceremony of the bells and lace
Still veils this reckless fool here

Now there are twenty-nine skaters on Wollman Rink
Circling in singles and in pairs
In this vigorous anonymity
A blank face at the window stares and
stares and stares and stares and stares
And the power of reason
And the flowers of deep feelings
Seem to serve me
Only to deceive me

Sharon you've got a husband
And a family and a farm
I've got the apple of temptation
And a diamond snake around my arm
But you still have your music
And I've still got my eyes on the land and the sky
You sing for your friends and your family
I'll walk green pastures by and by

"Black Crow"

There's a crow flying
Black and ragged
Tree to tree
He's black as the highway that's leading me
Now he's diving down
To pick up on something shiny
I feel like that black crow
Flying
In a blue sky

I took the ferry to the highway
Then I drove to a pontoon plane
I took a plane to a taxi
And a taxi to a train
I've been traveling so long
How'm I ever gonna know my home
When I see it again
I'm like a black crow flying
In a blue blue sky

In search of love and music
My whole life has been
Illumination
Corruption
And diving diving diving diving
Diving down to pick up on every shiny thing
Just like that black crow flying
In a blue sky

I looked at the morning
After being up all night
I looked at my haggard face in the bathroom light
I looked out the window
And I I saw that ragged soul take flight
I saw a back crow flying
In a blue sky

Oh I'm like a black crow flying
In a blue sky

"Blue Motel Room"

I've got a blue motel room
With a blue bedspread
I've got the blues inside and outside my head
Will you still love me
When I call you up when I'm down
Here in Savannah it's pouring rain
Palm trees in the porch light like slick black cellophane
Will you still love me
When I call you up when I get back to town
I know that you've got all those pretty girls coming on
Hanging on your boom-boom-pachyderm
Will you tell those girls that you've got German Measles
Honey, tell them you've got germs
I hope you'll be thinking of me
Because I'll be thinking of you
While I'm traveling home alone
Tell those girls that you've got Joni
She's coming back home

I've got road maps
From two dozen states
I've got coast to coast just to contemplate
Will you still love me
When I get back to town
It's funny how these old feelings hang around
You think they're gone
No, no
They just go underground
Will you still love me
When I get back to L.A. town
You and me, we're like America and Russia
We're always keeping score
We're always balancing the power
And that can get to be a cold cold war
We're going to have to hold ourselves a peace talk
In some neutral caf
You lay down your sneaking round the town, honey
And I'll lay down the highway

I've got a blue motel room
With a blue bedspread
I've got the blues inside and outside my head
Will you still love me
When I get back to town

"Refuge Of The Roads"

I met a friend of spirit
He drank and womanized
And I sat before his sanity
I was holding back from crying
He saw my complications
And he mirrored me back simplified
And we laughed how our perfection
Would always be denied
"Heart and humor and humility"
He said "Will lighten up your heavy load"
I left him then for the refuge of the roads

I fell in with some drifters
Cast upon a beachtown
Winn Dixie cold cuts and highway hand me downs
And I wound up fixing dinner
For them and Boston Jim
I well up with affection
Thinking back down the roads to then
The nets were overflowing
In the Gulf of Mexico
They were overflowing in the refuge of the roads

There was spring along the ditches
There were good times in the cities
Oh, radiant happiness
It was all so light and easy
Till I started analyzing
And I brought on my old ways
A thunderhead of judgment was
Gathering in my gaze
And it made most people nervous
They just didn't want to know
What I was seeing in the refuge of the roads

I pulled off into a forest
Crickets clicking in the ferns
Like a wheel of fortune
I heard my fate turn, turn turn
And I went running down a white sand road
I was running like a white-assed deer
Running to lose the blues
To the innocence in here
These are the clouds of Michelangelo
Muscular with gods and sungold
Shine on your witness in the refuge of the roads

In a highway service station
Over the month of June
Was a photograph of the earth
Taken coming back from the moon
And you couldn't see a city
On that marbled bowling ball
Or a forest or a highway
Or me here least of all
You couldn't see these cold water restrooms
Or this baggage overload
Westbound and rolling taking refuge in the roads

"Overture - Cotton Avenue"

A red sun came rolling down a grey sky
And the frogs and dogs and night birds then
Started up singing sweet country lullaby

You see that patch of city lights
Somewhere in there's Cotton Avenue
That's where I'm going to take myself tonight
With a spit shine on my dancing shoes

If you got a place like that to go
You just have to go there
If you got no place special
Well then, you just go no place special

I guess it's just the summer in the young blood
Ripe and juicy in the young blood
Teasing to go down to Cotton Avenue
To hear the shiny shiny music
See all the shiny people dancing to it
Anytime you go to Cotton Avenue

If you got a place like that to go
You know you got to go there
If you got no place special
Well then, you just go no place special

You see that summer storm brewing in the southern sky
By the time it hits here I'll be dancing high and dry
To rhythm and blues on Cotton Avenue
Poor boys'll be hanging around outside in the street
They got all the latest words
They're dancing to the latest beat
While they're hustling and sizing you on Cotton Avenue

If you got a place like that to go
You just have to go there
If you've got no place special
Well my dear
You just go no place special

"Talk To Me"

There was a moon and a street lamp
I didn't know I drank such a lot
'Till I pissed a tequila-anaconda
The full length of the parking lot
Oh, I talk too loose
Again I talk too open and free
I pay a high price for my open talking
Like you do for your silent mystery

Come and talk to me
Please talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
Mr. Mystery

We could talk about Martha
We could talk about landscapes
I'm not above gossip
But I'll sit on a secret where honor is at stake
Or we could talk about power
About Jesus and Hitler and Howard Hughes
Or Charlie Chaplin's movies
Or Bergman's Nordic blues
Please just talk to me
Any old theme you choose
Just come and talk to me
Mr. Mystery, talk to me

You could talk like a fool-I'd listen
You could talk like a sage
Anyway the best of my mind
All goes down on the strings and the page
That mind picks up all these pictures
It still gets my feet up to dance
Even though it's covered with keloids
From the "slings and arrows of outrageous romance"
I stole that from Willy the Shake
You know--"Neither a borrower nor a lender be"
Romeo, Romeo talk to me

Is your silence that golden
Are you comfortable in it
Is it the key to your freedom
Or is it the bars on your prison
Are you gagged by your ribbons
Are you really exclusive or just miserly
You spend every sentence as if it was marked currency
Come and spend some on me--
Shut me up and talk to me
I'm always talking
Chicken squawking
Please talk to me

"Jericho"

I'll try to keep myself open up to you
That's a promise that I made to love
When it was new
"Just like Jericho" I said
"Let these walls come tumbling down"
I said it like I finally found the way
To keep the good feelings alive
I said it like it was something to strive for

I'll try to keep myself open up to you
And approve your self expression
I need that, too
I need your confidence, baby
And the gift of your extra time
In turn I'll give you mine
Sweet darling, it's a rich exchange
It seems to me
It's a warm arrangement

Anyone will tell you
Just how hard it is to make and keep a friend
Maybe they'll short sell you
Or maybe it's you
Judas, in the end
When you just can no longer pretend
That you're getting what you need
Or you're giving out anything for them to grow and feed on

I'll try to keep myself open up to you
It gets easier and easier to do
Just like Jericho
Let these walls come tumbling down now
Let them fall right on the ground
Let all these dogs go running free
The wild and the gentle dogs
Kenneled in me

"Paprika Plains"

It fell from midnight skies
It drummed on the galvanized
In the washroom, women tracked the rain
Up to the make-up mirror
Liquid soap and grass
And Jungle Gardenia crash
On Pine-Sol and beer 
It's stifling in here 
I've got to get some air 
I'm going outside to get some air

Back in my hometown
They would have cleared the floor
Just to watch the rain come down
They're such sky oriented people
Geared to changing weather 
I'm floating off in time
I'm floating off
I'm floating off in time

When I was three feet tall
And wide eyed open to it all
With their tasseled teams they came
To McGee's General Store
All in their beaded leathers
I would tie on colored feathers
And I'd beat the drum like war 
I would beat the drum like war
I'd beat the drum
I'd beat the drum like war

But when the church got through
They traded their beads for bottles
Smashed on Railway Avenue
And they cut off their braids
And lost some link with nature
I'm floating into dreams
I'm floating off
I'm floating into my dreams

I dream paprika plains
Vast and bleak and God forsaken
Paprika plains
And a turquoise river snaking

(Where crows gaze vigilant on wires
Where cattle graze the grasses
Far from the digits of business hours
The moon clock wanes and waxes
But here all time is stripped away
Nowhere on these plains
Is a sprout or an egg in evidence
To measure loss or gain 
Only a little Indian band
Come down from some windy mesa
No women to make them food and child
No expressions on their faces
I'm low in a helicopter
And the wind from whirling blades
Flaps their woven blankets
And flags their raven braids
How came they to this emptiness
How came they to this dream
How came I to this view
From a flying machine
Of earth and air and water
And a band of Indian men
Without herds or flocks or crops
Or families or fires to tend
Like a phoenix up from ashes now
A blanket figure springs
With a fist raised up to turquoise skies
Like liberty
And at the point of vanishing
Where the sky and the earth meet
A bomb blooms
Deadly mushroom
White
Gold
Heat
Like a phoenix up from ashes
Up from violent mysteries
And growing 'till the giant blast
Is to it like a golfer's tee
there comes a child's beach ball
And memory takes me back
to the beach to toss it up
to the garage to get it patched
A pink and yellow beach ball
Rolling
Grand
Detached
Turning the blues and greens of earth
From space probe photographs
I float out of the hovercraft
Naked as infancy
And weightless
And drifting
Horizontally
Like a filing to a magnet
Like the long descent of rain
I am drawn
I fall against the ball
And lose paprika plains
I suckle at my mother's breast
I embrace my mother earth
I remember perforated blinds
Over the crib of my birth
And just as Eve succumbed
To reckless curiosity
I take my sharpest fingernail
And slash the globe to see
Below me
Vast Paprika plains
And the snake the river traces
And a little band of Indian men
With no expressions on their faces)

The rain retreats
Like troops to fall on other fields and streets
Meanwhile they're sweet talking and name calling
And brawling on the fringes of the floor
I spot you through the smoke
With your eyes on fire
From J&B and coke
As I'm coming through the door
I'm coming back
I'm coming back for more
The band plugs in again
You see that mirrored ball begin to sputter lights
And spin
Dizzy on the dancers
Geared to changing rhythms
No matter what you do
I'm floating back
I'm floating back to you

"Otis And Marlena"

Marlena under Foster Grants
She's undercover from the dawns advance
That girl is travel-drained
And the neon mercury vapor stained
Miami sky
It's red as meat
It's a cheap pink rose
Otis in the driver's seat
Watches the street lights fade away
On louvered blocks in green sea air
In fluorescent fossil yards
Slippers are shuffling into folding chairs
Freckled hands are shuffling cards

They've come for fun and sun
While Muslims stick up Washington

Otis empties out the trunk
On the steps of that celebrated dump
Sleazing by the sea
Bow down to her royal travesty
In her ballrooms heads of state
In her bedrooms rented girls
Always the grand parades of cellulite
Jiggling to her golden pools
Through flock and cupid colonnades
They jiggle into surgery
Hopefully beneath the blade
They dream of golden beauty

They've come for fun and sun
While Muslims stick up Washington

Marlena, white as stretcher sheet
Watches it all from her 10th floor balcony
Like it's her opera box
All those Pagliacci summer frocks
Otis is fiddling with the TV dial
All he gets are cartoons and reruns
She taps her glass with an emery file
Watching three rings in the sun
The golden dive, the fatted flake
And sizzle in the mink oil
It's all a dream
She has awake
Checked into Miami Royal
Where they've come for fun and sun
While Muslims hold up Washington
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on

"Dreamland"

It's a long, long way from Canada
A long way from snow chains
Donkey vendors slicing coconut
No parkas to their name
Black babies covered in baking flour
The cook's got a carnival song
We're going to lay down some place shady
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland

Walter Raleigh and Chris Columbus
Come marching out of the waves
And claim the beach and all concessions
In the name of the suntan slave
I wrapped that flag around me
Like a Dorothy Lamour sarong
And I lay down thinking national
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland

Goodtime Mary and a fortune hunter
All dressed up to follow the drums
Mary in a feather hula-hoop
Miss Fortune with a rose on her big game gun
All saints, all sinners shining
Heed those trumpets all night long
Propped up on a samba beat
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland

Tar baby and the Great White Wonder
Talking over a glass of rum
Burning on the inside
With the knowledge of things to come
There's gambling out on the terrace
And midnight ramblin' on the lawn
As they lead toward temptation
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland

In a plane flying back to winter
In shoes full of tropic sand
A lady in a foreign flag
On the arm of her Marlboro Man
The hawk howls in New York City
Six foot drifts on Myrtle's lawn
As they push the recline buttons down
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland

African sand on the trade winds
And the sun on the Amazon
As they push the recline buttons down
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland

"Don Juan's Reckless Daughter"

I'm Don Juan's reckless daughter
I came out two days on your tail
Those two bald-headed days in November
Before the first snowflakes sail
Out on the vast and subtle plains of mystery
A split tongue spirit talks
Noble as a nickel chief
Striking up an old juke box
And he says
"Snakes along the railroad tracks."
He says, "Eagles in jet trails"
He says, "Coils around feathers and talons on scales 
Gravel under the belly plates"
He says, "Wind in the Wings"
He says, "Big bird dragging its tail in the dust 
Snake kite flying on a string."

I come from open prairie
Given some wisdom and a lot of jive
Last night the ghosts of my old ideas
Reran on channel five
And it howled so spooky for its eagle soul
I nearly broke down and cried
But the split tongue spirit laughed at me
He says, "Your serpent cannot be denied."
Our serpents love the whisky bars
They love the romance of the crime
But didn't I see a neon sign
Fester on your hotel blind
And a country road come off the wall
And swoop down at the crowd at the bar
And put me at the top of your danger list
Just for being so much like you are

You're a coward against the altitude
You're a coward against the flesh
Coward caught between yes and no
Reckless this time on the line for yes, yes, yes
Reckless brazen in the play
Of your changing traffic lights
Coward slinking down the hall
To another restless night
As we center behind the eight ball
As we rock between the sheets
As we siphon the colored language
Off the farms and the streets
Here in Good-Old-God-Save-America
The home of the brave and the free
We are all hopelessly oppressed cowards
Of some duality
Of restless multiplicity
(Oh say can you see)

Restless for streets and honky tonks
Restless for home and routine
Restless for country safety and her
Restless for the likes of reckless me
Restless sweeps like fire and rain
Over virgin wilderness
It prowls like hookers and thieves
Through bolt locked tenements
Behind my bolt locked door
The eagle and the serpent are at war in me
The serpent fighting for blind desire
The eagle for clarity
What strange prizes these battles bring
These hectic joys these weary blues
Puffed up and strutting when I think I win
Down and shaken when I think I lose
There are rivets up here in this eagle
There are box cars down there on your snake
And we are twins of spirit
No matter which route home we take
Or what we forsake
We're going to come up to the eyes of clarity
And we'll go down to the beads of guile
There is danger and education
In living out such a reckless life style
I touched you on the central plains
It was plane to train my twin
It was just plane shadow to train shadow
But to me it was skin to skin
The spirit talks in spectrums
He talks to mother earth to father sky
Self indulgence to self denial
Man to woman
Scales to feathers
You and I
Eagles in the sky
You and I
Snakes in the grass
You and I
Crawl and fly
You and I

"Off Night Backstreet"

Maybe I'm just kidding myself when I say I love you
I don't know
Loving without trusting
You get frostbite and sunstroke
I wish I felt nothing
You pimp laughing and strutting her to my chartered seat
Your old off night back street

It's been stinger to stinger, darling
It's been heart to heart
You still keep me from finishing
Any new love I start
Now she's moved in with you
She's keeping your house neat
And your sheets sweet
And I'm your off night back street

I can feel your fingers
Feeling my face
There are some lines you put there
And some you erase
Maybe I'm just dramatizing
I don't care
It's home it can be heaven
When we play fair
But these sentimental journeys
Late at night
High in some back room you're calling me
To be your off night back street

You give me such pleasure
You bring me such pain
Who left her long black hair
In our bathtub drain

"The Silky Veils Of Ardor"

I am a poor wayfaring stranger
Traveling through all these highs and lows
I heard there was no sickness
And no toil or danger
Just mercy and plenty
Where peaceful waters flow
Where peaceful waters flow

Come all you fair and tender school girls
Be careful now when you court young men
They are like the stars
On a summer morning
They sparkle up the night
And they're gone again
Daybreak gone again

If I'd only seen through the silky veils of ardor
What a killing crime this love can be
I would have locked up my heart
In a golden sheath of armor
And kept its crazy beating
Under strictest secrecy
High security

I wish I had the wings
Of Noah's pretty little white dove
So I could fly this raging river
To reach the one I love
But I have no wings
And the water is so wide
We'll have to row a little harder
It's just in dreams we fly
In my dreams we fly

"God Must Be A Boogie Man"

He is three
One's in the middle unmoved
Waiting
To show what he sees
To the other two
To the one attacking so afraid
And the one that keeps trying to love and trust
And getting himself betrayed
In the plan oh
The divine plan
God must be a boogie man

One's so sweet
So overly loving and gentle
He lets people in
To his innermost sacred temple
Blind faith to care
Blind rage to kill
Why'd he let them talk him down
To cheap work and cheap thrills
In the plan oh
The insulting plan
God must be a boogie man

Which would it be
Mingus one or two or three
Which one do you think he'd want the world to see
Well world opinion's not a lot of help
When a man's only trying to find out
How to feel about himself
In the plan oh
The cock-eyed plan
God must be a boogie man

"Funeral"

"..led an enormous band."
[Swede] "Oh, But I know he's very lucky too, because when Mingus dies there's gonna be the same funeral they had for Duke Ellington... in a big church and the whole country's going to say, wow, he was so far out, you know what I mean"
[Charles] "No man, no big church I'm going to be buried man - I got my shit all figured out"
[Swede] "You're going to get a big funeral - you're famous"
[Charles] "Vedanta Society, India, I'm going to be buried in India"
[Swede] "I know, but you're going to get a big funeral in this country, and they'll play your music for two days"
[Charles] "Who's going to do that"
[Swede] "It's far out isn't it, y'know what I mean"
[Charles] "...You want me to hurry up, man"
[Swede] "No I don't want you to hurry up, but in the future, I know you're going to get a beautiful funeral - I can see it"
[Charles] "But I got it all planned, man"
[Swede] "...You're going to be here many more years."
[Charles] "You know the Vedanta Society in India.. Yuga"
[Swede] "Yeah"
[Charles] "Well I'm going to be buried by that church"
[Swede] "Yeah"
[Charles] "So they gotta find another place to do it, that's all."
[Swede] "...Plenty of time to go. You have another fifty years... you're lucky"
[Charles] "Uh, Duke lived to be 77 years old right"
[Swede] "Right"
[Charles] "I'm gonna cut him"
[Swede] "Coltrane was very strong, you know..."
[Charles] "I'm gonna cut Duke"

"A Chair In The Sky"

The rain slammed hard as bars
It caught me by surprise
Mutts of the planet
And shook me down for alibis
I'm waiting
For the keeper to release me
Debating this sentence
Biding my time
In memories
Of old friends of mine
In daydreams of Birdland
I see my soul on fire
Burning up the bandstand
Next time
I'll be bigger
I'll be better than ever
I'll be happily attached
To my cold hard cash
But now Manhattan holds me
To a chair in the sky
With the bird in my ears
And boats in my eyes
Going by

There are things I wish I'd done
Some friends I'm gonna miss
Beautiful lovers
I never got the chance to kiss
Daydreamin' drugs the pain of living
Processions of missing
Lovers and friends
Fade in and they fade out again
In these daydreams of rebirth
I see myself in style
Raking in what I'm worth
Next time
I'll be bigger
I'll be better than ever
I'll be resurrected royal
I'll be rich as Standard Oil
But now Manhattan holds me
To a chair in the sky
With the bird in my ears
And boats in my eyes
Going by

"The Wolf That Lives In Lindsey"

Of the darkness in men's minds
What can you say
That wasn't marked by history
Or the T.V. news today
He gets away with murder
The blizzards come and go
The stab and glare and buckshot
Of the heavy heavy snow
It comes and goes
It comes and goes

His grandpa loved an empire
His sister loved a thief
And Lindsey loved the ways of darkness
Beyond belief
Girls in chilly blouses
The blizzards come and go
The stab and glare and buckshot
Of the heavy heavy snow
It comes and goes
It comes and goes

The cops don't seem to care
For derelicts or ladies of the night
They're weeds for yanking out of sight
If you're smart or rich or lucky
Maybe you'll beat the laws of man
But the inner laws of spirit
And the outer laws of nature
No man can
No no man can

There lives a wolf in Lindsey
That raids and runs
Through the hills of Hollywood
And the downtown slums
He gets away with murder
The blizzards come and go
The stab and glare and buckshot
Of the heavy heavy snow
It comes and goes
It comes and goes

"I's A Muggin'"

I's a muggin, boom bada yada
Bom ba doo boo, we boopa dooboop
I's a muggin'

"Sweet Sucker Dance"

I almost closed the door
Cancelled on everything we opened up for
Tonight the shadows had their say
Their sad notions of the way
Things really are
Damn these blues
They'd turn my heart against you
Since I was fool enough
To find romance
I'm trying to convince myself
This is just a dance

We move in measures
Through loves' changing faces
Needy and nonchalant
Greedy and gracious
Through petty dismissals
And grand embraces
Like it was only a dance

We are survivors
Some get broken
Some get mended
Some can't surrender
They're too well defended
Some get lucky
Some are blessed
And some pretend
This is only a dance

We're dancing fools
You and me
Tonight it's a dance of insecurity
It's my solo
While you're away
Shadows have the saddest thing to say

Love
We can't live without it
Why do we go out and get it
Just to turn around and doubt it
Like we're scared to care
It's hard to talk about it
Aw it's only a dance
Tonight the shadows had their say
There's a sucker born a day
I heard them say
Born to lose
Am I a sucker to love you

You're such a sweet love
You're a proud man
You're a treasure
Time passes gracefully
Living can be such a pleasure
You make it easy to take it in measures
Like it was only a dance

We're dancing fools
You and me
Tonight it's a dance of insecurity
It's my solo
Blue way
And shadows have the saddest things to say

We are survivors
Some get broken
Some get mended
Some can't surrender
They're too well defended
Some get lucky
Some are blessed
And some pretend
It's only a dance

"Coin In The Pocket"

[Charles]
I never hit too, too hard, uh, y'know.
All my life, uh y'know, just everything I touched, turned to gold.
I'm not, I'm not rich but, y'know, I've always had a few, some dollars in my pockets

"The Dry Cleaner From Des Moines"

I'm down to a roll of dimes
I'm stalking the slot that's hot
I keep hearing bells all around me
Jingling in the lucky jackpots
They keep you tantalized
They keep you reaching for your wallet
Here in fools' paradise

I talked to a cat from Des Moines
He said he ran a cleaning plant
That cat was clanking with coin
Well, he must have had a genie in a lamp
'Cause every time
I dropped a dime I blew it
He kept ringing bells nothing to it

He got three oranges, three lemons
Three cherries, three plums
I'm losing my taste for fruit
Watching the dry cleaner do it
Like Midas in a polyester suit
It's all luck, it's just luck
You get a little lucky and you make a little money

I followed him down the strip
He picked out a booth at Circus Circus
Where the cowgirls fill the room with their big balloons
The cleaner was pitching with purpose
He had Dinos and Pooh Bears
And lions, pink and blue there
He couldn't lose there

Des Moines was stacking the chips
Raking off the tables
Ringing the bandit's bells
This is a story that's a drag to tell
(In some ways)
Since I lost every dime
I laid on the line
But the cleaner from Des Moines
Could put a coin
In the door of a John
And get twenty for one
It's just luck

"Lucky"

[Charles] I was lucky, man. God blessed me, y'know I was blessed by God.

"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat"

When Charlie speaks of Lester
You know someone great has gone
The sweetest swinging music man
Had a Porkie Pig hat on
A bright star
In a dark age
When the bandstands had a thousand ways
Of refusing a black man admission
Black musician
In those days they put him in an
Underdog position
Cellars and chitlins'

When Lester took him a wife
Arm and arm went black and white
And some saw red
And drove them from their hotel bed
Love is never easy
It's short of the hope we have for happiness
Bright and sweet
Love is never easy street
Now we are black and white
Embracing out in the lunatic New York night
It's very unlikely we'll be driven out of town
Or be hung in a tree
That's unlikely

Tonight these crowds
Are happy and loud
Children are up dancing in the streets
In the sticky middle of the night
Summer serenade
Of taxi horns and fun arcades
Where right or wrong
Under neon
Every feeling goes on
For you and me
The sidewalk is a history book
And a circus
Dangerous clowns
Balancing dreadful and wonderful perceptions
They have been handed
Day by day
Generations on down

We came up from the subway
On the music midnight makes
To Charlie's bass and Lester's saxophone
In taxi horns and brakes
Now Charlie's down in Mexico
With the healers
So the sidewalk leads us with music
To two little dancers
Dancing outside a black bar
There's a sign up on the awning
It says "Pork Pie Hat Bar"
And there's black babies dancing
Tonight

"Chinese Cafe  Unchained Melody"

Caught in the middle
Carol we're middle class
We're middle aged
We were wild in the old days
Birth of rock 'n' roll days
Now your kids are coming up straight
And my child's a stranger
I bore her
But I could not raise her
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long

Down at the Chinese Cafe
We'd be dreaming on our dimes
We'd be playing "Oh my love, my darling"
One more time

Uranium money
Is booming in the old home town now
It's putting up sleek concrete
Tearing the old landmarks down now
Paving over brave little parks
Ripping off Indian land again
How long how long
Short sighted business men
Ah nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long

Down at the Chinese Cafe
We'd be dreaming on our dimes
We'd be playing "You give your love, so sweetly"
One more time

Christmas is sparkling
Out on Carol's lawn
This girl of my childhood games
With kids nearly grown and gone
Grown so fast
Like the turn of a page
We look like our mothers did now
When we were those kids' age
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Down at the Chinese Cafe
We'd be dreaming on our dimes
We'd be playing
"Oh my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me"
(Time goes - where does the time go
I wonder where the time goes)

"Wild Things Run Fast"

He came
She smiled
She thought she had him tamed
But he was just as wild
Eating from her hand at last
Wild things run fast

In the dark
He could see
The trap that was lying in her
Sweet company
Eating from her hand at last
Wild things run fast

Winter beat the pines about
He heard the heater
Cutting in and out
While she dreamed away 

In the night
It snowed
Fast tracks in the powder white
Leading out to the road
Winding from her tender grasp
Wild things run fast
Wild things run fast
Wild things run fast

What makes you run
Wild thing
I thought you loved me

"Ladies Man"

Well, I've heard of heartbreakers
But you take the cake
Ladies' man
You could charm the diamonds
Off a rattlesnake
Ladies' man
Ladies bring it on over
When you give 'em the glance
They don't stand a chance
First, you unfold them
Then you pigeon-hole 'em
Ladies' man

Well it sure takes a lot of
Good natured self-control
Ladies' man
When I'm so hot for you and
You're so cold, so cold
Ladies' man
Why do you keep on trying to
Make a man of me
Couldn't you just love me
Like you love cocaine
Cocaine head games

Cross my heart I swear
I'm not trying to trick you
No tricks
Ladies' man
It's just a straight ahead feeling
I have for you
Nothing slick
Ladies' man
I guess you learn to refuse
What you think you can't handle
You're acting like a vandal
Wrecking the dream
At the first bad scene
Ladies' man
Ladies' man
Ladies' man
Ladies' man

"Moon At The Window"

It takes cheerful resignation
Heart and humility
That's all it takes
A cheerful person told me
Nobody's harder on me than me
How could they be
And nobody's harder on you than you

Betsy's blue
She says, "Tell me something good"
You know I'd help her out if I only could
Oh, but sometimes the light
Can be so hard to find
At least the moon at the window
The thieves left that behind

People don't know how to love
They taste it and toss it
Turn it off and on
Like a bathtub faucet
Oh sometimes the light
Can be so hard to find
At least the moon at the window
The thieves left that behind

I wish her heart
I know these battles
Deep in the dark
When the spooks of memories rattle
Ghosts of the future
Phantoms of the past
Rattle, rattle, rattle
In the spoon and the glass

Is it possible to learn
How to care and yet not care
Since love has two faces
Hope and despair
And pleasure always turns to fear
I find
At least the moon at the window
The thieves left that behind
At least they left the moon
Behind the blind
Moon at the window

"Solid Love"

I'm gonna give you my very best
You are my happiness
You
Open my heart up you do

"Be Cool"

If there's one rule to this game
Everybody's gonna name
It's be cool
If you're worried or uncertain

"(You're So Square) Baby I Don't Care"

You're so square, baby
You're so square 
Oh, you don't like greasy diners
You don't like sleazy bands
You just wanna go
To a movie show
And sit there holding hands
You're so square
Baby I don't care

You don't like going to parties
To toot and talk all night long
You just wanna park
Where it's nice and dark
And kiss me sweet and strong
You're so square
Darling, I don't care

You don't know any dance steps that are new
But nobody else could love me the way you do

I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why
I love you baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square
Baby, I don't care

Oh, I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why
I love you baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square
I don't care

You're so square

"You Dream Flat Tires"

It came to pass
Like lightning striking from above
Electric flash
Just like lightening striking from above
Struck by precious love
Precious, precious love
So hopeless and so inspired
Why do you dream flat tires
When you dream flat tires
You dream flat tires

With a jack and a spare you're there
Trying to get to where love is
Coming in on a wing and a prayer
Trying to get to where love is
'Cause love is precious love
You said it was precious
When first you felt my fire
Before you dreamed flat tires
You dreamed flat tires
You dream flat tires

"Woman she bounce back easy
But a man could break both his legs"
Are you telling me this to tease me
Or just to hear me beg
"Please don't go"

Cause I know that you love me
But when are you going to let love be
Just a vague flirtation
Or extra special company
'Cause love is precious love
Everybody knows it's precious
When first they feel that fire
Before they dream flat tires
They dream flat tires
They dream flat tires

"Woman she bounce back easy
But a man could break both his legs"
Do you tell me that to tease me
Or just to hear me beg
"Please don't be cold"

I know that you love me
But what are you going to let love do
(Flat tires, love, love is precious, flat tires,
Love, love is precious, flat tires, love,
Love is precious)

"Man To Man"

No demands
Just pleasurable sensations
Hand in hand
No far reaching plans
No, no hand in hand
Well I keep on trying to understand
Daylight bright
How come I keep moving
From man to man to man
Giving my sweet love
Tasting sweet love
Woman to man

Sometimes it's easy
You drift with the empty gladness
Like it all belongs
Sometimes it's low down sadness
Like it's all gone so wrong
When I saw you standing there
I said to myself
Mmm here's a place
I could break down and care
I'll give him my sweet love
Taste his sweet love
Real sweet love
Woman to man

I don't like to lie
But I sure can be phony when I get scared
I put my nose up in the air
Stoney, stoney when I get scared
When I saw you standing there
I was scared
I thought
Oh I hope he can care
I sure hope I can care
I hope we can really care
And share woman to man
Cause I've been moving
Man to man to man to man to man
Oh what am I looking for
Man to man to man to man
A lot of good guys gone through my door
Man to man to man to man
To man to man to man
Man to man to man to man
Woman to man

"Underneath The Streetlight"

Yes I do I love you
I swear on the stars above I do
I swear on the streetlight on the corner
Shoving back the shadows
One shadow cursing
Another shadow laughing
Underneath the streetlight
I don't know where they're coming from
I just see 'em passing
Underneath the streetlight 

Yes I do I love you
I swear on the buildings above I do
I swear on a billion yellow and T.V. blue windows
Gayboys with their pants so tight
Out in the neon light
Underneath the street light
A m-m-madman - madman
Kicking over garbage cans
Underneath the streetlight 

Yes I do I love you
I swear on the blinkin' planes above I do
I swear on the truck at the stoplight
With his airbrakes moaning
All night the trucks roll
Up to the tunnel-toll
Underneath the streetlight
They come rollin', rollin'
Rollin' for a living
Underneath the streetlight 

Yes I do I love you
I swear on the disco sparkle dark I do
I swear on the be-bop boys
Chasing the black bird
Rock 'n' roll broadcast
Movin' up now full blast
Underneath the streetlight
They come dancin', dancin'
Really rock 'n rollin'
Underneath the streetlight
Yes I do I love you
I really love you
Yes I do yes I do
I love you

"Love (Corinthians II13)"

Although I speak in tongues
Of men and angels
I'm just sounding brass
And tinkling cymbals without love

Love suffers long
Love is kind
Enduring all things
Love has no evil in mind

If I had the gift of prophecy
And all the knowledge
And the faith to move the mountains
Even if I understood all of the mysteries
If I didn't have love
I'd be nothing

Love never looks for love
Love's not puffed up
Or envious
Or touchy
Because it rejoices in the truth
Not in iniquity
Love sees like a child sees

As a child I spoke as a child
I thought and I understood as a child
But when I became a woman
I put away childish things
And began to see through a glass darkly

Where as a child I saw it face to face
Now I only know it in part
Fractions in me
Of faith and hope and love
And of these great three
Love's the greatest beauty
Love
Love
Love

"Good Friends"

I have to come and see you
Maybe once or twice a year
I think nothing would suit me better
(Right now)
Than some downtown atmosphere 

In the dance halls and the galleries
Or betting in the OTB
Synchronized like magic
Good friends you and me

The sun goes down in Jersey
Rises over Little Italy
We could talk it up 'til the block gets up
Swapping stories

Sitting around in some all-night zoo
Watching it run like a movie
Synchronized like magic
Good friends you and me

No hearts of gold
No nerves of steel
No blame for what we can and cannot feel

But now it's cloak and dagger
Walk on eggshells and analyze
Every particle of difference
Oh, gets like mountains in our eyes

You say, "You're unscrupulous"
You say, "You're naive"
Synchronized like magic
Good friends you and me

No hearts of gold
No nerves of steel
No blame for what we can and cannot feel

Sometimes change comes at you
Like a broadside accident
There is chaos to the order
Random things you can't prevent

There could be trouble around the corner
There could be beauty down the street
Synchronized like magic
Good friends you and me

No hearts of gold
No nerves of steel
No blame for what we can and cannot feel

No nerves of steel
No hearts of gold
No blame for what we can and can't control

Good friends you and me
Good friends you and me

"The Three Great Stimulants"

I picked the morning paper off the floor
It was full of other people's little wars
Wouldn't they like their peace
Don't we get bored
And we call for the three great stimulants
Of the exhausted ones

Artifice, brutality and innocence
Artifice and innocence

No tanks have ever rumbled through these streets
and the drone of planes at night has never frightened me
I keep the hours and the company that I please
And we call for the three great stimulants
Of the exhausted ones

Artifice, brutality and innocence
Artifice and innocence

Oh and deep in the night
Our appetites find us
Release us and blind us
Deep in the night
While madmen sit up building bombs
And making laws and bars
They'd like to slam free choice behind us

I saw a little lawyer on the tube
He said, "It's so easy now, anyone can sue."
"Let me show you how your petty aggravations can profit you"
Call for the three great stimulants
Of the exhausted ones

Artifice, brutality and innocence
Artifice and innocence

Oh and deep in the night
Appetites find us
Release us and blind us
Deep in the night
While madmen sit up building bombs
And making laws and bars
They're gonna slam free choice behind us

Last night I dreamed I saw the planet flicker
Great forests fell like buffalo
Everything got sicker
And to the bitter end
Big business bickered
And they call for the three great stimulants
Of the exhausted ones

Artifice, brutality and innocence
Artifice and innocence

Oh these times, these times
Oh these changing times
Change in the heart of all mankind
Oh these troubled times

"Tax Free"

Front rooms

Slide into tables
Crowd into bathrooms
Joke around
Cheap talk
Deep talk
Talk, talk, talk around the clock

I don't feel so good
Push a button to escape

Preacher on the tube crying "Lord"
There's evil in this land
([Evangelist] "Rock and roll music")
"Cast down these dope fiends
And their noisy bands"
([Evangelist] "Damn their souls")

Preacher preaching love like vengeance
Preaching love like hate
Calling for large donations
Promising estates

Rolling lawns and angel bands
Behind the pearly gates
You know, he will have his in this life
But yours'll have to wait

He's immaculately tax free
([Evangelist] "Multiple hundreds of thousands of ...")
Tax free
([Evangelist] "Hundreds and millions of dollars")
Tax free
([Evangelist] "A hundred billion dollars)
And who is paying the price
Who, who
"Your children are"

Pissed off
Jacked up
Scream into the mike
Spit into the loving cup
Strut like a rooster
March like a man
God's hired hands and the devil bands
Packing the same grandstands

Different clothes
([Evangelist] "Pot in their pockets")
Different hair
([Evangelist] "Sexually active")
Raise a screaming guitar or a Bible in the air
Theatre of anguish
Theatre of glory
God's hired hands and the devil bands

Oh come let us adore me

Lord, there's danger in this land
You get witch hunts and wars
When church and state hold hands
Fuck it

Tonight I'm going dancing
With the drag queens and the punks
Big beat deliver me
From this sanctimonious skunk

We're no flaming angels
And he's not heaven sent
How can he speak for the Prince of Peace
When he's hawk-right militant

And he's immaculately tax free
([Evangelist] "Our nation has lost its guts")
Save me
([Evangelist] "Our nation has lost its strength")
Tax free
([Evangelist] "Our nation has whimpered and cried")
Save me
([Evangelist] "And petted the Castros")
Tax free
([Evangelist] "The Khomeinis' and the Kaddafis'")
Save me
([Evangelist] "For so long")
Tax free
([Evangelist] "That we don't know how to act like a man")
Save me
([Evangelist] "I think that we should turn the United States Marines loose on that little island south of Florida and stop that problem")

"Smokin' (Empty, Try Another)"

Nicotine attack
Nicotine, nicotine

Try another, try another, try another, try another
Empty, empty try another

Try another, try another, try another, try another
Empty, empty try another

Try another, try another, try another, try another
Empty, empty try another

Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke

Try another, try another, try another, try another

"Dog Eat Dog"

Dog eat dog

It's dog eat dog
I'm just waking up
The dove is in the dungeon
And the white-washed hawks peddle hate and call it love
Dog eat dog
Holy hope in the hands of
Snakebite evangelists and racketeers
And big-wig financiers

Dog eat dog
On prime-time crime the victim begs
Money is the road to justice
And power walks it on crooked legs
Prime-time crime
Holy hope in the hands of
Snakebite evangelists and racketeers
And big-wig financiers

Where the wealth's displayed
Thieves and sycophants parade
And where it's made
The slaves will be taken
Some are treated well
In these games of buy and sell
And some like poor beasts
Are burdened down to breaking

Dog eat dog
It's dog eat dog, ain't it Flim Flam man
Dog eat dog, you can lie, cheat, skim, scam
Beat 'em any way you can
Dog eat dog
You'll do well in this land of
Snakebite evangelists and racketeers
You could get to be
A big-wig financier

Land of snap decisions
Land of short-attention spans
Nothing is savored
Long enough to really understand
In every culture in decline
The watchful ones among the slaves
Know all that is genuine will be
Scorned and conned and cast away

Dog eat dog
People looking, seeing nothing
Dog eat dog
People listening, hearing nothing
Dog eat dog
People lusting, loving nothing
Dog eat dog
People stroking, touching nothing
Dog eat dog
Knowing nothing
Dog eat dog

"Shiny Toys"

Shiny toys right on time
Shiny toys right on time
Shiny toys

I'm reading people rags in the checkout lane
Look, here's a hunk here's a honey
Celebrated people and their claims to fame
Here's a boy and his money
And pictures of the winners in the latest
Ratepoll games

Whatever makes you "Yahoo"
Whatever makes your time feel satisfyin'
Whatever makes you
"Oh I am so excited"
Whatever makes you feel like you're right on time

Party night
Good bands all over town
(Good, good, good)
Mega lights and supersonic sounds
(Good, good, good)
Flashy boys and girls that really play
(Good, good, good)
Shiny toys, when it's over don't you hate
To have to put your toys away

Shiny toys
"I love my Porsche"
Shiny toys
Shiny toys
"I love my Porsche"
Shiny toys
Simple joys

Walking on the beach at the end of the day
Between the sand and the seagulls
Watching the glorious sun setting on the bay
Here comes a boy and his beagle
Walking with a man in a toupee
And a man with his head shaved

Whatever makes you "Mmmm, mmmm"
Whatever makes your time feel satisfyin'
Whatever makes you "Mmmmm, mmmm"
Whatever makes you feel like you're right on time

Party night
Super bands all over town
(Good, good, good)
Super lights and supersonic sounds

Flashy boys and girls that really play

To have to put your toys away

"Ethiopia"

Hot winds and hunger cries
Ethiopia
Flies in your babies' eyes
Ethiopia
Walking sticks on burning plains
Betrayed by politics
Abandoned by the rains

On and on the human need
On and on the human greed profanes

Ethiopia Ethiopia Ethiopia

Your top soil flies away
Ethiopia
We pump ours full of poison spray
Ethiopia
Between the brown skies and sprinkling lawns
I hear the whine of chain saws
Hacking rain forests down

On and on insanities
On and on short-sighted greed abounds

Ethiopia Ethiopia Ethiopia

Little garden planet oasis in space
Some hearts hurt they can hardly stand it
Famine phantoms at the garden gates

Ethiopia Ethiopia Ethiopia

Every Sunday on TV
Ethiopia
You suffer with such dignity
Ethiopia
A TV star with a PR smile
Calls your baby "it" while strolling
Through your tragic trials

On and on stupidity
On and on the basic needs are defiled
Good air good water good earth

Ethiopia Ethiopia Ethiopia

Little garden planet oasis in space
Some hearts hurt they can hardly stand the waste

"Impossible Dreamer"

The street was loud
From an angry crowd and
I thought of you, I thought of you
Dreamer
Land of the free
No hungry bellies
Impossible
Impossible dreamer

In the darkest part of the night
Blue shadows conjure you
And in the brightest height of the daylight
Sometimes I blink 'cause I think I see you
Dreaming like you do

The moon was bright
Like day for night
And I thought of you
I thought of you
Dreamer
No acid rain
Love without pain
Impossible
Impossible dreamer

In the darkest part of the night
Blue shadows conjure you
And at the brightest height of the daylight
Sometimes I blink 'cause I think I see you
Dreaming like you do

The room was dark
And full of sharks
And I thought of you
I thought of you
Dreamer
Give peace a chance
Don't think just dance
Impossible
Impossible dreamer

In the darkest part of the night
Blue shadows conjure you
And at the brightest height of the daylight
Sometimes I blink 'cause I think I see you
Dreaming like you do

"Lucky Girl"

I'm a lucky girl
I found my friend
I've been all around the world
Mission impossible
Chasing the rainbow's end

Wise guys
Shy guys
And sly lover boys
With big bad bedroom eyes
I never loved a man I trusted
As far as I could pitch my shoe
'Til I loved you

You're my lucky star
You're my magician
You make the night prowling disappear
Vanished from the star wars bars
Empty repetition
I get my heart full here

Playboys
Stray boys
And "Say, hey, hey" boys'll treat you like a toy
I never loved a man I trusted
As far as I could pitch my shoe
'Til I loved you

Cheaters
Woman beaters
And Huck Finn shucksters hopping parking meters
I never loved a man I trusted
As far as I could pitch my shoe
'Til I loved you

I'm a lucky girl
I found my friend
I been all around the world
Mission impossible
Chasing the rainbow's end

Wise guys
Booby-prize guys
And sly lover boys
With big bad bedroom eyes
I never loved a man I trusted
As far as I could throw my shoe
'Til I loved you

"My Secret Place"

I'm going to take you to
My special place
It's a place that you
Like no one else I know
Might appreciate
I don't go there with anyone but
You're a special case
For my special place
For my secret place

People talk to tell you something
Or to take up space
Guess I'm only talking
To be talking to
Your pretty face
I don't talk much to anyone but
You're a special case
For my special place
My secret place

I was born and raised
In New York City
I'm just getting used to Colorado
Oh street bravado
Carry me
Why did you bring me to
A place so wild and pretty
Are there pigeons in this park
Muggers after dark
In these golden trees
In the secret place

I'm going to take you to
My special place
It's a place no amount of hurt and anger
Can deface
I put things back together there
It all falls right in place
In my special space
My special place

Once I saw a film
In New York City
That was shot in Colorado
Girl meets desperado
In the trembling mountain trees
Out of all of the girls that you see
In bleachers and cafe windows
Sitting flirting with someone
Looking to have some fun
Why did you pick me
For the secret place

"Lakota"

I am Lakota
Lakota
Looking at money man
Diggin' the deadly quotas
Out of balance
Out of hand

We want the land
Lay down the reeking ore
Don't you hear the shrieking in the trees
Everywhere you touch the earth she's sore
Every time you skin her all things weep
Your money mocks us
Restitution what good can it do
Kenneled in metered boxes
Red dogs in debt to you

I am Lakota
Lakota
Fighting among ourselves
All we can say with one whole heart
Is we won't sell
No we'll never sell

We want the land
The lonely coyote calls
In the woodlands footprints of the deer
In the barrooms poor drunk bastard falls
In the courtrooms deaf ears sixty years
You think we're sleeping but
Quietly like rattlesnakes and stars
We have seen the trampled rainbows
In the smoke of cars

I am Lakota
Brave
Sun pity me
I am Lakota
Broken
Moon pity me
I am Lakota
Grave
Shadows stretching
Lakota
Oh pity me

I am Lakota
Weak
Grass pity me
I am Lakota
Faithful
Rocks pity me
I am Lakota
Meek
Standing water
Lakota
Oh pity me

I am Lakota
Lakota
Standing on sacred land
We never sold these Black Hills
To the missile heads
To the power plants

We want the land
The bullet and the fence broke Lakota
The black coats and the booze broke Lakota
Courts that circumvent choke Lakota
Nothing left to lose
Tell me grandfather
You spoke the fur and feather tongues
Do you hear the whimpering waters
When the tractors come

I am Lakota
Brave
Sun pity me
I am Lakota
Broken
Moon pity me
I am Lakota
Slave
Shadows stretching
Lakota
Oh pity me

I am Lakota
Weak
Grass pity me
I am Lakota
Faithful
Rocks pity me
I am Lakota
Meek
Standing water
Lakota
Oh pity me

Sun pity me

Stretching on the forest floor

Standing in a wakan manner

"The Tea Leaf Prophecy (Lay Down Your Arms)"

Study war no more
Lay down your arms
Study war no more
Lay 'em down lay 'em down now
Study war no more
Lay down your arms
Study war no more

Newsreels rattle the Nazi dread
The able-bodied have shipped away
Molly McGee gets her tea-leaves read
You'll be married in a month they say
"These leaves are crazy
Look at this town there's no men left
Just frail old boys and babies
Talking to teacher in the treble clef"

She plants her garden in the spring
She does the winter shovelling
Tokyo Rose on the radio
She says she's leavin' but she don't go

Out of the blue just passin' thru
A young flight sergeant
On two weeks leave
Says "Molly McGee no one else will do"
And seals the tea-leaf prophecy
Oh these nights are strong and soft
Private passions and secret storms
Nothin' about him ticks her off
And he looks so cute in his uniform

She plants her garden in the spring
He does the winter shovelling
But summer's just a sneeze
In a long long bad winter cold
She says "I'm leavin' here" but she don't go

"Sleep little darlin'
This is your happy home
Hiroshima cannot be pardoned
Don't have kids when you get grown
Because this world is shattered
The wise are mourning
The fools are joking
Oh what does it matter
The wash needs ironing
And the fire needs stoking"

She plants her garden in the spring
He does the winter shovelling
The three of 'em laughing 'round the radio
She says "I'm leavin' here" but she don't go

She plants her garden in the spring
They do the winter shovelling
They sit up late and watch the
Johnny Carson show
She says "I'm leavin' here but she don't go".

"Dancin' Clown"

No, you couldn't call Jesse a babe in the woods
He's just weak in self-defense
'Cause he's so thin skinned
He can't take a joke at his expense
"You're a push button window," says Rowdy Yates
"I can run you up and down
Anytime I want
I can make you my dancin'
My dancin' clown"
You're my dancin' clown
Dancin' dancin'
Dancin' clown
Dancin'
You're my dancin' clown
Dancin' dancin' dancin'
Dancin' clown

Rowdy Yates is as bold as Jove
He's all chide and snide and bluff
Stuck in the romantic tradition
Of acting rough and tough
"You're always charging thru," says Jesse
Nervous, lookin' all around
To see who's seein' him bein' a dancin'
A dancin' clown
He's a dancin' clown
Dancin' dancin'
Dancin' clown
Dancin'
He's a dancin' clown
Dancin' dancin' dancin'
Dancin' clown

Cherchez la femme
Whenever love comes around
Someone's a dancin' clown
Cherchez la femme
Whenever hearts start to pound
Someone's a dancin' clown

Down the street comes last-word Suzie
She's high yellow, lookin' top nice
You hear the swoosh of jungle blades
And the crackle of northern ice
"Hot damn" says Rowdy lookin' up
"Yum" says Jesse lookin' down
"How would you like to be her dancin'
Her dancin' clown"
Be her dancin' clown
Dancin' dancin'
Dancin' clown
Dancin'
Be her dancin' clown
Dancin' dancin' dancin'
Dancin' clown

Cherchez la femme
Whenever love comes to town
Someone's a dancin' clown
Cherchez la femme
Wherever hearts start to pound
Someone's a dancin' clown

"Cool Water"

All day I face the barren waste
Without a taste of water
Cool water
Old Dan and I
Our throats slate dry
Our spirits cry out for water
Cool clear water
Keep on movin' Dan
Some devils had a plan
Buried poison in the sand
Don't drink it man
It's in the water
Cool clear water
In my mind I see
A big green tree
And a river flowin' free
Waitin' up ahead
For you and me
Cool clear water

The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star is a pool of water
Cool water
But come the dawn
We carry on
We won't last long without water
Cool clear water
Keep on movin' Dan
We're still in no-man's land
Dry bones and sand
People never planned here for water
Cool clear water
In my mind I see
A big green tree
And a river flowin' free
Waiting up ahead for you and me
Cool clear water

The shadows sway
They seem to say
Tonight we pray for water
Cool water
And way up there
If you care
Please show us where
There's good water
Cool clear water

"The Beat Of Black Wings"

I met a young soldier
He said his name was Killer Kyle
He was shakin' all over
Like a night-frightened child
This is his story
It's a tough one for me to sing
Hard as the squawk and the flap
And the beat ofthe beat of black wings

Charley Angel
Charley Angel
Charley Angel

"They gave me a gun," he said
"They gave me a mission
For the power and the glory
Propaganda piss on 'em
There's a war zone inside me
I can feel things exploding
I can't even hear the fucking music playing
For the beat of the beat of black wings."

Charley Angel
Charley Angel
Charley Angel

Charley Angel

Charley Angel

He said, "I never had nothin'
Nothin' I could believe in
My girl killed our unborn child
Without even grieving
I put my hands on her belly
To feel the kid kickin' damn
She'd been to some clinic
Oh the beat of black wings."

Charley Angel
Charley Angel
Charley Angel

"They want you they need you
They train you to kill
To be a pin on some map
Some vicarious thrill
The old hate the young
That's the whole heartless thing
The old pick the wars
We die in 'em
To the beat ofthe beat of black wings."

Charley Angel
Charley Angel
Charley Angel

"There's a man drawing pictures
On the sidewalk with chalk
Just as fast as he draws 'em
Rain come down and wash 'em off
Keep the drinks comin', girl
'Til I can't feel anything
I'm just a chalk mark in a rainstorm
I'm just the beat of black wings."

"Snakes And Ladders"

He
In a shopping mall
Finally met the perfect girl
She is all that matters
The only one in all the world
Like a Barbie doll
Oh love is snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

She
Just to have and hold
Is the perfect air-brushed angel
Makes you hot just looking at her
Stapled into all his braincells
Like a centerfold
Oh love is snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom climb back up
Buy the townhouse
Call the preacher
Get to the bottom climb back up
Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom climb back up
Set up credit for the lovely creature
The lovely creature

He
On a corporate climb
Set his sights on power for her
On a silver platter
He gave up happy hour for her
Perrier and lime
Oh love is snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders
She
In a handsome world
Put her mind to social graces
All the privileged chatter
Setting pretty table places
For the girls in pearls
Oh love is snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom climb back up
Buy the carphone
Call the broker
Get to the bottom climb back up
Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom climb back up
Buy the wife a diamond choker
A diamond choker

True love true love true love
He's so nervous
New love new love new love
When he's with her
Oh he's wasting away
True love true love true love
It's so curious
New love new love new love
Just to kiss her
To kiss her to kiss her to kiss her
To kiss her to kiss her to kiss her
To kiss her he has to shave

She
In the gilded mirrors
In the swing of fancy places
Where the black ties flatter
Started seeing other faces
Young fogie financiers
Oh love is snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

See
In the crimes of time
How the seasons steal away
How the rungs are shattered
First you're green then you're grey
Still the snakes unwind
Still playin' snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom climb back up
Sell the vineyard
Call the lawyer
Get to the bottom climb back up
Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom climb back up
Gather garbage to destroy her
To destroy her

Ladders ladders ladders
The perfect girl
Ladders ladders ladders
The paper chase Love is snakes and ladders
Ladders ladders ladders
The social whirl
Ladders ladders
The rat race

"The Reoccuring Dream"

This is the reoccurring dream
Born in the dreary gap between

And what we wish we could have

More fulfilling and less frustrating

"A Bird That Whistles"

I took a house by the water
Took a man on a mountainside
Pretty house by the water
Lovely lover by the waterside
Last time I saw that man
He hung down his head and cried

Corrina, Corrina
Do you have to go
Corrina, Corrina
Tell me why do you have to go
Just made me come to love you girl
Now you pack your things and go
Leave me this bird that whistles
Leave me this bird that sings

I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that's singin'
If I don't have you darlin'
Birds don't mean nothin'

"Night Ride Home"

Once in a while
In a big blue moon
There comes a night like this
Like some surrealist
Invented this 4th of July
Night ride home

Hula girls
And caterpillar tractors in the sand
The ukulele man
The fireworks
This 4th of July
Night ride home

I love the man beside me
We love the open road
No phones till Friday
Far from the overkill
Far from the overload

Back at the bar
The band tears down
But out here in the headlight beams
The silver powerlines
Gleam
On this 4th of July
Night ride home

Round the curve
And a big dark horse
Red taillights on his hide
Is keeping right alongside
Rev for stride
4th of July
Night ride home

I love the man beside me
We love the open road
No phones till Friday
Far from the undertow
Far from the overload

Once in awhile
In a big blue moon
There comes a night like this
Like some surrealist
Invented this 4th of July
Night ride home

"Passion Play (When All The Slaves Are Free)"

Magdalene is trembling
Like a washing on a line
Trembling and gleaming
Never before was a man so kind
Never so redeeming

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue
In radiation rose
Ecstasy
Now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free
(Who're you gonna get)

I am up a sycamore
Looking through the leaves
A sinner of some position
Who in the world can this heart healer be
This magical physician

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue
In radiation rose
Misery
Now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free
(Who're you gonna get)

Enter the multitudes
The walking wounded
They come to this diver of the heart
Of the multitudes
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done

Oh, climb down, climb down he says to me
From the middle of unrest
They think his light is squandered
But he sees a stray in the wilderness
And I see how far I've wandered

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue
In radiation rose
Apathy
Now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free
(Who're you gonna get)

Enter the multitudes
The walking wounded
They come to this diver of the heart
Of the multitudes
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done

Oh, all around the marketplace
The buzzing of the flies
The buzzing and the stinging
Divinely barren
And wickedly wise
The killer nails are ringing

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue
In radiation rose
Tragedy
Now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free
(Who're you gonna get)

"Cherokee Louise"

Cherokee Louise is hiding in this tunnel
In the Broadway bridge
We are crawling on our knees
We've got flashlights and batteries
We've got cold cuts from the fridge

Last year about this time
We used to climb up in the branches
Just to sway there in some breeze
Now the cops on the street
They want Cherokee Louise

People like to talk
Tongues are waggin' over fences
Waggin' over phones
All their doors are locked
God she can't even come to our house
But I know where she'll go

To the place where you can stand
And press your hands like it was bubble bath
In dust piled high as me
Down under the street
My friend poor Cherokee Louise

Ever since we turned thirteen
It's like a minefield
Walking to the door
Going out you get the third degree
And comin' in you get the third world war

Tuesday after school
We put our pennies on the rails
And when the train went by
We were jumpin' round like fools
Going "Look no heads or tails"
Going "Look my lucky prize"

She runs home to her foster dad
He opens up a zipper
And he yanks her to her knees
Oh please be here please
My friend poor Cherokee Louise

Cherokee Louise is hiding in this tunnel
In the Broadway bridge
We're crawling on our knees
I've got Archie and Silver Screen
I know where she is

The place where you can stand
And press your hands like it was bubble bath
In dust piled high as me
Down under the street
My friend poor Cherokee Louise

Oh Cherokee Louise, poor Cherokee Louise
Cherokee Louise, Cherokee Louise

"The Windfall (Everything For Nothing)"

You think I should buy you a car
Why Because Elvis did
No. Come on

Because Elvis gave 'em cars
You think I'm cheap
And you're hard done by
Look you live here like a star
Rent free suite
Big blue pool that you sun by
Trips to tropic shores
Clothes from fancy stores
You want too much
You want too badly
You want everything for nothing

Going to the church
You chant
For my downfall
Chanting for my house
My friends
You want it all
The pillows on my bed
The visions in my head
You want too much
You want too badly
You want everything for nothing

In the land of litigation
The courts are like game shows
Take what's behind the curtain
The jury cries
I'm not going to be the jackpot
At the end of your perjured rainbow
Not if local justice has even one good eye

Oh it's not like I was blind
I saw
But I took no action
As you began to climb
Green clawed
Dissatisfaction
It wasn't hard to guess
That the end would be a mess
You want too much
You want too badly
You want everything for nothing

In the land of mass frustration
The judges are sleeping
Counting wooly little lawyers
And grinding their teeth
Outside my sleepless window
The Hollywood sirens are shrieking
While down some searchlit alley runs
Some lost belief

Oh I'm tangled in your lies
Your scam
Your spider web
Spit spun between the trees
Doors slam
You want my head
You'd eat your young alive
For a jaguar in the drive
You lie too much
You lie too badly
You want everything for nothing

"Slouching Towards Bethlehem"

Turning and turning
Within the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer
Things fall apart
The centre cannot hold
And a blood dimmed tide
Is loosed upon the world

Nothing is sacred
The ceremony sinks
Innocence is drowned
In anarchy
The best lack conviction
Given some time to think
And the worst are full of passion
Without mercy

Surely some revelation is at hand
Surely it's the second coming
And the wrath has finally taken form
For what is this rough beast
Its hour come at last
Slouching toward Bethlehem to be born
Slouching toward Bethlehem to be born

Hoping and hoping
As if by my weak faith
The spirit of this world
Would heal and rise
Vast are the shadows
That straddle and strafe
And struggle in the darkness
Troubling my eyes

Shaped like a lion
It has the head of a man
With a gaze as blank
And pitiless as the sun
And it's moving its slow thighs
Across the desert sands
Through dark indignant
Reeling falcons

Surely some revelation is at hand
Surely it's the second coming
And the wrath has finally taken form
For what is this rough beast
Its hour come at last
Slouching toward Bethlehem to be born
Slouching toward Bethlehem to be born
To be born

(Head of a man, shape of a lion)

Raging and raging
It rises from the deep
Opening its eyes
After twenty centuries
Vexed to a nightmare
Out of a stony sleep
By a rocking cradle
By the Sea of Galilee

Surely some revelation is at hand
Surely it's the second coming
And the wrath has finally taken form
For what is this rough beast
Its hour come at last
Slouching toward Bethlehem to be born
Slouching toward Bethlehem to be born
To be born

(Head of a man, shape of a lion)

"Come In From The Cold"

Back in 1957
We had to dance a foot apart
And they hawk-eyed us from the sidelines
Holding their rulers without a heart
And so with just a touch of our fingers
Oh we could make our circuitry explode
All we ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold 

Come in
Come in from the cold
(We were so young)
Oh come in
Come in from the cold

We really thought we had a purpose
We were so anxious to achieve
We had hope
The world held promise
For a slave to liberty
Freely I slaved away for something better
And I was bought and sold
And all I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

Come in
Come in from the cold
(We were so sure)
Oh come in
Come in from the cold

I feel your leg under the table
Leaning into mine
I feel renewed
I feel disabled
By these bonfires in my spine
I don't know who the arsonist was
Which incendiary soul
But all I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold 

Come in
Come in from the cold
(You were so warm)
Oh come in
Come in from the cold

I am not some stone commission
Like a statue in a park
I am flesh and blood and vision
I am howling in the dark
Long blue shadows of the jackals
Are falling on a pay phone by the road
Oh, all they ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

Come in
Come in from the cold
(I was so low)
Oh come in
Come in from the cold

Is this just vulgar electricity
Is this the edifying fire
(It was so pure)
Does your smile's covert complicity
Debase as it admires
(Just a flu with a temperature)
Are you just checking out your mojo
Or am I just fighting off growing old
(Just a high fever)
All I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

Come in
Come in from the cold
(It was so pure)
Oh come in
Come in from the cold

I know we never will be perfect
Never entirely clear
(When the moon shines)
We get hurt and we just panic
And we strike out
Out of fear
(You were only being kind)
I fear the sentence of this solitude
200 years on hold
(For my loving crime)
Oh and all we ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold 

Come in
Come in from the cold
(When the moon shines)
Oh come in
Come in from the cold

When I thought life had some meaning
Then I thought I had some choice
(I was running blind)
And I made some value judgments
In a self-important voice
(I was outta line)
But then absurdity came over me
And I longed to lose control
(Into no mind)
Oh all I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold 

Come in
Come in from the cold
(You were so kind)
Please come in
(So kind)
Come in from the cold
Come in come in
Come in from the cold

"Nothing Can Be Done"

Must I forgive you
Each time
And say you don't know what you're doing
There are no victimless crimes
I know of
Out here in these graffiti ruins
My love

Oh I am not old
I'm told
But I am not young
Oh and nothing can be done
Don't start
My heart
Is a smoking gun
Oh and nothing can be done

I heard you leaving
Late last night
I heard you screaming down the mountain
Like you were running red lights
(Red lights)
You had some trash-can-rock-band pounding

Oh I am not old
I'm told
But I am not young
Oh and nothing can be done
Don't start
My heart
Is a smoking gun
Oh and nothing can be done

Must I surrender
With grace
The things I loved when I was younger
(Sweet embrace)
Must I remember your face
So well
What do I do here with this hunger

Oh I am not old
I'm told
But I am not young
Oh and nothing can be done
Don't start
My heart
Is a smoking gun
Oh and nothing can be done

Nothing can be done
Nothing can be done
Oh nothing can be done

"The Only Joy In Town"

I want to paint a picture
Botticelli style
Instead of Venus on a clam
I'd paint this flower child
"You are the air my flowers breathe"
He calls, and the ladies turn around
On the first day of Spring
I'm looking at the only joy around

He's the only joy around
The only joy I found
The only joy in town

The Spanish steps are crowded
Bunch of bodies brooding there
Dead pan side-walk vendors
Hustling vacant stares
Making all the more exceptional
This fool in a flower crown
On the first day of Spring
I'm looking at the only joy in town

He's the only joy around
The only joy I found
The only joy in town

The Botticelli black boy
With the fuchsias in his hair
Is breathing in women like oxygen
On the Spanish stairs
In my youth I would have followed him
All through this terra-cotta town
On the first day of Spring
We'd dance and sing
And be the only joy around

We'd be the only joy around
The only joy in town
He's the only joy I've found
All day

At night these streets are empty
Where does everybody go
Where are the brash and tender rooms
In Roman candle glow
Where are Fellini's circus'
La Dolce Vita clowns
On the first day of Spring
I'm looking
At the only joy in town

He's the only joy around
The only joy I found
The only joy in town

"Ray's Dad's Cadillac"

Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Rollin' past the rink
Past the record shack
Pink fins in the falling rain
Rollin'
To the blue lights past the water mains

Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Weekends we'd get
Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Rock 'n roll in the dashboard
Romance in the back of
Ray's Dad's Cadillac

Ray's dad teaches math
ero
I'm a dunce
I'm a decimal in his class
Last night's kisses won't erase
ero
I just can't keep the numbers in their place

Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Last night we had
Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Rock 'n roll in the dashboard
Romance in the back of
Ray's Dad's Cadillac

When it comes to mathematics
I got static in the attic
"No sir, nothing's clear"
I'll be blackboard blind on Monday
Dreamin' of blue runways
On the edge of here
A little atmosphere

Blue lights out on airport road
Motown, in a field in a farmer's grove
Big planes comin' overhead
Lowdown
You can see the bolts
You can see the tire treads

Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Weekends we'd get
Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Oh, little darlin'
Rock 'n' roll in the dashboard
Romance in the back of
Ray's Dad's Cadillac

Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Ray's Dad's Cadillac

"Two Grey Rooms"

Tomorrow is Sunday
Now there's only one day left to go
Till you walk by
Below my window
The weekends drive me mad
Holidays are oh too sad
'Cause you don't go
Below my window

No one knows I'm here
One day I just disappeared
And I took these two grey rooms up here
With a view
When you walk by
Below my window

You look so youthful
Time has been untruthful
Heaven knows I loved you
30 years ago
Hot days your shirt's undone
Rainy days you run
Oh and then you fade so fast
Below my window

No one knows I'm here
One day I just disappeared
And I took these two grey rooms up here
With a view
Only when you walk by
Below my window
When you walk by

Below my window
Below my window
Hey hey
Below my window
Below my window
Below my window

"Sunny Sunday"

She pulls the shade
It's just another sunny Sunday
She dodges the light like Blanche DuBois
Bright colors fade away on such a sunny Sunday
She waits for the night to fall
Then she points a pistol through the door
And she aims at the streetlight
While the freeway hisses
Dogs bark as the gun falls to the floor
The streetlight's still burning
She always misses
But the day she hits
That's the day she'll leave
That one little victory, that's all she needs
She pulls the shade
It's just another sunny Monday
She waits for the night to fall

"Sex Kills"

I pulled up behind a Cadillac
We were waiting for the light
And I took a look at his license plate
It said 'Just Ice'

Is Justice just ice
Governed by greed and lust
Just the strong doing what they can
And the weak suffering what they must

And the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills

Oh, sex kills

Doctors' pills give you brand new ills
And the bills bury you like an avalanche
And lawyers haven't been this popular
Since Robespierre slaughtered half of France

And Indian chiefs with their old beliefs know
The balance is undone crazy ions
You can feel it out in traffic
Everyone hates everyone

And the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills

Oh, sex kills

All these jackoffs at the office
The rapist in the pool
Oh and the tragedies in the nurseries
Little kids packing guns to school

The ulcerated ozone
These tumors of the skin
This hostile sun beating down on
The massive mess we're in

And the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills

Sex kills
Sex kills
Oh, sex kills
Sex kills

"How Do You Stop"

Hard bodies
Soft emotions
So fast
So smart
The world is at your feet
But what about your heart
Fame and fortune can't hold you tight
In the late late hours of the night

How do you stop
Before it's too late
You choose and you lose
If you hesitate
How do you stop
Before it's too late
You think love will wait
So you don't hold on
And then it's gone

You've had success
Lots of fancy friends
You've tasted the good life
You thought it would never end
One day you're too young
Then you're in your prime
Then you're looking back at the hands of time

How do you stop
Before it's too late
You choose and you lose
If you hesitate
How do you stop
Before it's too late
You think love will wait
So you don't hold on
And then it's gone

How do you stop a runaway train
How do you stop the driving rain
How do you stop the ripening corn
How do you stop a baby being born

How do you stop
Before it's too late
You choose and you lose
If you hesitate
How do you stop
Before it's too late
How do you stop
You're lost if you hesitate
How do you stop
Love from slipping away
How do you stop
Before it's too late

"Turbulent Indigo"

You wanna make Van Goghs
Raise 'em up like sheep
Make 'em out of Eskimos
And women if you please
Make 'em nice and normal
Make 'em nice and neat
You see him with his shotgun there
Bloodied in the wheat
Oh what do you know about
Living in Turbulent Indigo

Brash fields, crude crows
In a scary sky ...
In a golden frame
Roped off
Tourists guided by ...
Tourists talking about the madhouse
Talking about the ear
The madman hangs in fancy homes
They wouldn't let him near
He'd piss in their fireplace
He'd drag them through Turbulent Indigo

"I'm a burning hearth," he said
"People see the smoke
But no one comes to warm themselves
Sloughing off a coat
And all my little landscapes
All my yellow afternoons
Stack up around this vacancy
Like dirty cups and spoons
No mercy Sweet Jesus
No mercy from Turbulent Indigo."

"Last Chance Lost"

Last chance lost
In the tyranny of a long good-bye
Last chance lost
We talk of us with deadly earnest eyes
Last chance lost
We talk of love in terms of sacrifice and compromise
Last chance
Last chance lost

Last chance lost
The hero cannot make the change
Last chance lost
The shrew will not be tamed
Last chance lost
They bicker on the rifle range
Blame takes aim
Last chance
Last chance lost

"The Magdalene Laundries"

I was an unmarried girl
I'd just turned twenty-seven
When they sent me to the sisters
For the way men looked at me
Branded as a Jezebel
I knew I was not bound for Heaven
I'd be cast in shame
Into the Magdalene laundries

Most girls come here pregnant
Some by their own fathers
Bridget got that belly
By her parish priest
We're trying to get things white as snow
All of us woe-begotten-daughters
In the steaming stains
Of the Magdalene laundries

Prostitutes and destitutes
And temptresses like me
Fallen women
Sentenced into dreamless drudgery 
Why do they call this heartless place
Our Lady of Charity
Oh charity

These bloodless brides of Jesus
If they had just once glimpsed their groom
Then they'd know, and they'd drop the stones
Concealed behind their rosaries
They wilt the grass they walk upon
They leech the light out of a room
They'd like to drive us down the drain
At the Magdalene laundries

Peg O'Connell died today
She was a cheeky girl
A flirt
They just stuffed her in a hole
Surely to God you'd think at least some bells should ring
One day I'm going to die here too
And they'll plant me in the dirt
Like some lame bulb
That never blooms come any spring
Not any spring
No, not any spring
Not any spring

"Not To Blame"

The story hit the news
From coast to coast
They said you beat the girl
You loved the most
Your charitable acts
Seemed out of place
With the beauty
With your fist marks on her face
Your buddies all stood by
They bet their fortunes
And their fame
That she was out of line
And you were not to blame

Six hundred thousand doctors
Are putting on rubber gloves
And they're poking
At the miseries made of love
They say they're learning
How to spot
The battered wives
Among all the women
They see bleeding through their lives
I bleed
For your perversity
These red words that make a stain
On your white-washed claim that
She was out of line
And you were not to blame

I heard your baby say
When he was only three
"Daddy, let's get some girls
One for you and one for me."
His mother had the frailty
You despise
And the looks
You love to drive to suicide
Not one wet eye around
Her lonely little grave
Said, "He was out of line girl
You were not to blame."

"Borderline"

Everybody looks so ill at ease
So distrustful so displeased
Running down the table
I see a borderline
Like a barbed wire fence
Strung tight, strung tense
Prickling with pretense
A borderline

Why are you smirking at your friend
Is this to be the night when
All well-wishing ends
All credibility revoked
Thin skin, thick jokes
Can we blame it on the smoke
This borderline

Every bristling shaft of pride
Church or nation
Team or tribe
Every notion we subscribe to
Is just a borderline
Good or bad, we think we know
As if thinking makes things so
All convictions grow along a borderline

Smug in your jaded expertise
You scathe the wonder world
And you praise barbarity
In this illusionary place
This scared hard-edged rat race
All liberty is laced with
Borderlines

Every income, every age
Every fashion-plated rage
Every measure, every gauge
Creates a borderline
Every stone thrown through glass
Every mean-streets-kick ass
Every swan caught on the grass
Will draw a borderline

You snipe so steady
You snub so snide
So ripe and ready
To diminish and deride
You're so quick to condescend
My opinionated friend
All you deface, all you defend
Is just a borderline
Just a borderline ...
Another borderline ...
Just a borderline

"Yvette In English"

He met her in a French cafe
She slipped in sideways like a cat
Sidelong glances
what a wary little stray
She sticks in his mind like that

Saying, "Avez-vous un allumette"
With her lips wrapped around a cigarette
Yvette in English saying,
"Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss."

He's fumbling with her foreign tongue
Reaching for words and drawing blanks
A loud mouth is stricken deaf and dumb
In a bistro on the left bank

"If I were a painter," Picasso said,
"I'd paint this girl from toe to head"
Yvette in English saying,
"Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss."

Burgundy nocturne tips and spills
They trot along nicely in the spreading stain
New chills, new thrills for the old uphill battle
How did he wind up here again

Walking and talking touched and scared
Uninsulated wires laid bare
And Yvette in English going,
"Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss."

What blew her like a leaf his way
Up in the air and down to Earth
First she flusters then she frays
So quick to question her own worth

Her cigarette burns her fingertips
As it falls like fireworks she curses it
Then sweetly in English she says,
"Please have this,
Little bit of instant bliss."

He sees her turn and walk away
Skittering like a cat on stone
Her high heels clicking
What a wary little stray
She leaves him by the Seine alone

With the black water and the amber lights
And the bony bridge between left and right
Yvette in English saying,
"Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss."

"The Sire Of Sorrow (Job's Sad Song)"

Let me speak, let me spit out my bitterness
Born of grief and nights without sleep and festering flesh
Do you have eyes
Can you see like mankind sees
Why have you soured and curdled me
Oh you tireless watcher What have I done to you
That you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true

Once I was blessed I was awaited like the rain
Like eyes for the blind, like feet for the lame
Kings heard my words, and they sought out my company
But now the janitors of Shadowland flick their brooms at me
Oh you tireless watcher What have I done to you
that you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true

([Antagonists] Man is the sire of sorrow)
I've lost all taste for life
I'm all complaints
Tell me why do you starve the faithful
Why do you crucify the saints
And you let the wicked prosper
You let their children frisk like deer
And my loves are dead or dying, or they don't come near
([Antagonists] We don't despise your chastening
God is correcting you)

Oh and look who comes to counsel my deep distress
Oh, these pompous physicians
What carelessness
([Antagonists] Oh all this ranting all this wind
Filling our ears with trash)
Breathtaking ignorance adding insult to injury
They come blaming and shaming
([Antagonists] Evil doer)
And shattering me
([Antagonists] This vain man wishes to seem wise
A man born of asses)
Oh you tireless watcher What have I done to you
That you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true

([Antagonists] We don't despise your chastening)
Already on a bed of sighs and screams,
And still you torture me with visions
You give me terrifying dreams
Better I was carried from the womb straight to the grave.
I see the diggers waiting, they're leaning on their spades.

([Antagonists] Man is the sire of sorrow
Sure as the sparks ascend)
Where is hope while you're wondering what went wrong
Why give me light and then this dark without a dawn
([Antagonists] Evil is sweet in your mouth
Hiding under your tongue)
Show your face
([Antagonists] What a long fall from grace)
Help me understand
What is the reason for your heavy hand
([Antagonists] You're stumbling in shadows
You have no name now)
Was it the sins of my youth
What have I done to you
That you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true
([Antagonists] Oh your guilt must weigh so greatly)
Everything I dread and everything I fear come true
([Antagonists] Man is the sire of sorrow)
Oh you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true

"Harlem In Havana"

At the far end of the midway
by the double ferris wheel
There's a band that plays so snakey
You can't help how you feel
Emmy May ran away
With a man as dark as night
You can see him, if you go there
Second trumpet to the right

They play "Night Train"
So snakey
Black girls dancing
Long and leggy
Barkers barking
Step right up, folks
The show is about to begin
It's Harlem in Havana time
Step right in

Silver spangles 
See 'em dangle
In the farm boys' eyes
Hootchie kootchie
Auntie Ruthie would've cried 
If she knew we were on the inside

When Emmy May ran away
She came back a bottle blonde
God The gossips had a gourmet feast
Chomping on how she went wrong
But miracle of miracles
'Cause we were underage
She got us nearly front row seats
To the right side of the stage

See that tall girl
That's a man
That one, too 
With the yellow feather fan
Barkers barking
Step right up, folks
The show is about to begin
It's Harlem in Havana time
Step right in

Silver spangles 
See 'em dangle
In the farm boys' eyes
Hootchie kootchie
Auntie Ruthie would've died 
If she knew we were on the inside

"Man From Mars"

Since I lost you
I can't get through the day
Without at least one big boo-hoo
The pain won't go away
What am I gonna do
Man from Mars
This time you went too far

I fall apart
Everytime I think of you
Swallowed by the dark
There is no center to my life now
No grace in my heart
Man from Mars
This time you went too far

I call and call
The silence is so full of sounds
You're in them all
I hear you in the water
And the wiring in the walls
Man from Mars
This time you went too far

"Love Puts On A New Face"

He said "You think you're a lady 
But I know you're a woman
We are as young as the night"
I said "No telephones ringing
No company coming
Just the lap of the lake and the firelight"
And the lonely loon and the crescent moon
What a pocket of heavenly grace
But in France they say
Everyday
Love puts on a new face
Love has many faces

About a month or so later he said
"Why can't you be happy
You make me feel helpless when you get this way"
I said "I'm up to my neck in alligators
Jaws gnashing at me
Each one trying to pull a piece away"
Darling, you can't slay these beasts of prey
Some bad dreams even love can't erase
But in France they say
Everyday
Love puts on a new face
Love has many faces

He wrote "I wish you were with me here
The leaves are electric
They burn on the river bank
Countless heatless flames"
I said "Send me some pictures then 
And I'll paint pyrotechnic
Explosions of your autumn till we meet again
I miss your touch and your lips so much
I long for our next embrace"
But in France they say
Everyday 
Love puts on a new face
Love puts on a new face
Love has many faces
Many many faces

"Lead Balloon"

"Kiss my ass" I said
And I threw my drink
Tequila trickling 
Down his business suit
Must be the Irish blood
Fight before you think
Turn it now
You can't cowtow
You can't undo it

It's his town
And that went down
Like a lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon
He said "Sic her, Rover"
That went over 
Like a lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon
Lead balloon

An angry man is just an angry man
But an angry woman
Bitch
I had to ask him for a helping hand
It came with the heart
Of a Bonaparte
Of a frozen fish

It's his town
And that went down
Like a lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon
He said "Sic her, Rover"
That went over
Like a lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon
Lead balloon

Lead balloon, lead lead lead lead balloon
Lead balloon, lead lead lead lead balloon
Lead balloon, lead lead lead lead balloon
Lead balloon

It's his town
And that went down
Like a lead balloon
Lead lead lead balloon
He said "Sic her, Rover"
That went over
Like a lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon
Lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon
Lead balloon

"No Apologies"

The general offered
No apologies
He said "The soldiers erred in judgement
They should have hired a hooker"
No apologies
to the outraged Japanese
No "Sorry little girl"
The pigs just took her

Tire skids and teethmarks
What happened to this place
Lawyers and loan sharks 
Are laying America to waste

Freddie said that Juan thinks, I think
He's the devil
What a lofty title
For such a petty little tyrant
Bigger beasts abound
And they kick this world around
At this crazy speed
With violence and greed

Tire skids and teethmarks
What happened to this place
Lawyers and loan sharks
Are laying America to waste

So what makes a man a man
In these tough times
As druglords buy up the banks
And warlords radiate the oceans
Ecosystems fail
Snakes and snails and puppy tails
Are wagging in the womb
Beneath the trampled moon

Tire skids and teethmarks
What happened to this place
Lawyers and loan sharks
Are laying America to waste

The general offered
No apologies

"Taming The Tiger"

I stepped outside to breathe the air
And stare up at the stars
Big dipper hanging there
Over the rent-a-car
Over the rent-a-car
I'm a runaway from the record biz
From the hoods in the hood and the whiny white kids

Boring
The old man is snoring
And I'm taming the tiger
(You can't tame the tiger)
Tiger, tiger burning bright
Nice, kitty kitty
Tiger, tiger burning bright

Sophia says "It's hard to catch
And harder still to ride
The time to watch the beast the best
Is when it's purring at your side"
Purring at your side
Accolades and honors
One false move and you're a goner

Boring
The old man is snoring
And I'm taming the tiger
(You can't tame the tiger)
Tiger, tiger burning bright
Nice, kitty kitty
Tiger, tiger burning bright
In the forest of the night

The moon shed light
On my hopeless plight
As the radio blared so bland
Every disc, a poker chip
Every song just a one night stand
Formula music, girly guile
Genuine junk food for juveniles
Up and down the dial
Mercenary style

I watched the stars chuck down their spears
And a plane went blinking by
And I thought of Anna
Wild and dear
Like fireworks in the sky
Fireworks in the sky
I'm so sick of this game
It's hip, it's hot
Life's too short, the whole thing's gotten

Boring
The old man is snoring
And I'm taming the tiger
(You can't tame the tiger)
Tiger, tiger burning bright
Nice, kitty kitty

(Boring)
Tiger, tiger burning bright
(You can't tame the tiger)
Oh, be nice, kitty kitty
(Boring)
Tiger, tiger burning bright
Nice, kitty kitty
(Boring, boring)
Tiger, tiger burning bright
(Fight to the light, fight to the light)
In the forest of the night

"The Crazy Cries Of Love"

It was a dark and a stormy night
Everyone was at the wing-ding
They weren't the wing-ding type
So they went up on the train bridge 
Where the weather was howling
And oh, oh, my my
When that train comes rolling by
No paper thin walls, no folks above 
No one else can hear 
The crazy cries of love

They were laughing, they were dancing in the rain
They knew their love was a strong one
When they heard the far off whistle of a train
They were hoping it was going to be a long one
Cuz oh, oh, my my
When that train comes rolling by
No paper thin walls, no folks above
No one else can hear
The crazy cries of love

In the back booth of an all night cafe
Two dripping raincoats are hanging
Outside in the weather 
The shade on the streetlight is clanging
And they smile ear to ear and eye to eye
Ice cream is melting on a piece of pie
Oh, my my
No one else can hear
The cries of love

Every kiss was sweet and strong
Every touch was totally tandem
As the train come a-rumbling along
They sang a lover's song of wild abandon
And oh, oh, my my
When that train comes rolling by
No paper thin walls, no folks above
No one else can hear 
The crazy cries of love 
No paper thin walls, no folks above
No one else can hear
The crazy cries of love

"Stay In Touch"

This is really something
People will be envious
But our roles aren't clear
So we musn't rush
Still, we're burning brightly
Clinging like fire to fuel
I'm grinning like a fool
Stay in touch
We should stay in touch
Oh Stay in touch
In touch

Part of this is permanent
Part of this is passing
So we must be loyal and wary
Not to give away too much
Til we build a firm foundation
And empty out old habits
Old habits
Stay in touch
We should stay in touch
Oh Stay in touch
In touch

During times like these
The wise are influential
They can bear the imperfections
They can keep the harmony
No doubt about it
No doubt that's essential
No doubt that's always been a tricky one for me
So, we should just surrender
Let fate and duty shape us 
Let light hearts remake us
Let the worries hush
In the middle of this continent
In the middle of our time on Earth
We perceive one another
Stay in touch
We should stay in touch
Oh Stay in touch
In touch

"Face Lift"

I went so numb on Christmas day
I couldn't feel my hands or feet
I shouldn't have come
She made me pay
For gleaming with Donald down her street
She put blame on him
And shame on me
She made it all seem so tawdry and cheap
"Oh, let's be nice, Mama, open up your gifts
You know, happiness is the best facelift"

I mean, after all, she introduced us
Oh, but she regrets that now
Shacked up downtown 
Making love without a license
Same old sacred cow
She said, "Did you come home to disgrace us"
I said, "Why is this joy not allowed
For God's sake, I'm middle-aged, Mama
And time moves swift 
And you know happiness is the best facelift"

Oh, love takes so much courage
Love takes so much shit
She said "You've seen too many movies, Joni"
She said "Snap out of it"
Oh, the cold winds blew at our room with a view
All helpful and hopeful and candlelit
We kissed the angels and the moon eclipsed
You know, Happiness is the best facelift

We pushed the bed up to the window 
To see the Christmas lights
On the east bank across the steaming river
Between the bridges lit up Paris-like
This river has run through both our lives
Between these banks of our continuing delights
Bless us, don't let us lose the drift
You know, Happiness is the best facelift.

"My Best To You"

So here's to you
May your dreams come true
May old father time
Never be unkind
And through the years
Save your smiles and your tears
They're just souvenirs
They'll make music in your heart
Remember this
Each new day is a kiss
Sent from up above 
With an angel's love
So here's to you
May your skies be blue
And your love blessed
That's my best to you

Remember this
Each new day is a kiss
Sent from up above 
With an angel's love
So here's to you
May your skies be blue
And your love blessed
That's my very best to you

"You're My Thrill"

You're my thrill
You do something to me
You send chills right through me
When I look at you
'Cause you're my thrill

You're my thrill
How my pulse increases
I just go to pieces
Every time I look at you
I can't keep still

Nothing seems to matter
Here's my heart on a silver platter
Oh where is my will
Why this strange desire
Flaming higher and higher
Every time I look at you
I can't keep still
You're my thrill

Oh where's my will
Why this strange desire
Flaming higher and higher
Every time I look at you
I can't keep still
Oh you're my thrill

"At Last"

At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a lovely song

At last
The skies above are blue
My heart's wrapped up in clover
Ever since the night I looked at you

I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill like I have never known

When you smile
When you smile at me
That's how the spell was cast
And now here we are in heaven
I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill like I had never known

Oh when you smile
When you smile at me
That's how the spell was cast
And now here we are in heaven
I found my love at last
At last

"Comes Love"

Comes a rain storm
Put your rubbers on your feet
Comes a snow storm
You can get a little heat
Comes love
Nothing can be done

Comes a fire
Firemen come and rescue you
Blow a tire
You can patch the inner tube
Comes love
Nothing can be done

Don't try hidin'
'Cause it isn't any use
You'll just start slidin'
When your heart turns on the juice

Comes a heat wave
You can hurry to the shore
Comes a summons
Hide yourself behind a door
Comes love
Nothing can be done

Comes a headache
You can lose it in a day
Comes a toothache
See your dentist right away
Comes love
Nothing can be done

Comes the measles
You can quarantine the room
Comes a mousie
You can chase it with a broom
Comes love
Nothing can be done

That's all brother
If you've ever been in love
That's all brother
And you know just what I'm speakin' of

Comes a nightmare
You can always stay awake
Comes depression
You could get another break
Comes love
Nothing can be done
Nothing can be done

"You've Changed"

You've changed
The sparkle in your eyes is gone
Your smile is just a careless yawn
You're breaking my heart
You've changed

You've changed
Your kisses now are so blas
You're bored with me in every way
I can't understand
You've changed

You've forgotten the words I love you
And the memories that we've shared
You've ignored all the stars up above you
I can't realize that you ever cared
You've changed

You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me, I know we're through
It's all over now
You've changed

You've forgotten the words I love you
And the memories that we've shared
You ignore all the stars up above you
I can't realize that you ever cared
You've changed

You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me, I know we're through
It's all over now
You've changed

"Answer Me, My Love"

Answer me
Oh my love
Just what sin have I been guilty of
Tell me how I came to lose your love
Please answer me sweetheart

You were mine yesterday
I believed that love was here to stay
Won't you tell me how I've gone astray
Please answer me my love

If you're happier without me
I'll try not to care
But if you still think about me
Please listen to my prayer

You must know that I've been true
Won't you say that we can start anew
In my sorrow now I turn to you
Please answer me my love

If you're happier without me
I'll try not to care
But if you still think about me
Please listen to my prayer

You must know that I've been true
Won't you say that we can start anew
In my sorrow now I turn to you
Please answer me my love
Answer me my love

"A Case Of You"

Just before our love got lost you said
"I am as constant as a northern star"
And I said, "Constantly in the darkness
Where's that at
If you want me I'll be in the bar"

On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV-screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh, Canada
And I sketched your face on it twice

Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine
Oh and you taste so bitter but you taste so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you
I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I'd still be on my feet

Oh, I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid

I remember that time that you told me
You said, "Love is touching souls"
Surely you touched mine
'Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time

Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine
And you taste so bitter and you taste so sweet
I could drink a case of you
I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I'd still be on my feet

I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds
And she said, "Go to him, stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed"

Oh, but you are in my blood
You're my holy wine
Oh, and you taste so bitter but you taste so sweet
I could drink a case of you darling
And still I'd be on my feet
Still I'd be on my feet

"Don't Go To Strangers"

Build your dreams
To the stars above
But when you need someone true to love
Don't go to strangers
Lover come to me

Play with fire
Get your fingers burned
But when there's no place left to turn
Don't go to strangers
Lover come to me

You give the call to follow your heart
You'll follow your heart, I know
I've been around
I'm an old hand
I'll understand if you have to go

So make your mark
For your friends to see
But when you need more than company
Don't go to strangers
Lover come to me

Don't go to strangers
Lover come to me

"Sometimes I'm Happy"

Sometimes I'm happy
Sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
As long as I have the sun in your eyes

Sometimes I love you
Sometimes I hate you
When I hate you
It's because I love you
That's how I am
So what can I do
I'm happy when I'm with you

Sometimes I'm happy
Sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
As long as I have the sun in your eyes

Sometimes I love you
Sometimes I hate you
When I hate you
It's because I love you
That's how I am
So what can I do
I'm happy when I'm with you

I'm happy when I'm with you
I'm happy when I'm with you
I'm happy when I'm with you
I'm happy when I'm with you

"Don't Worry 'Bout Me"

Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Just be happy my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then don't worry 'bout me

Why should we cling to some old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then you don't worry 'bout me

"Stormy Weather"

Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all of the time

Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor self together
I'm weary all the time
All the time

So weary all of the time
When you went away
The blues stepped up and met me
If he's gone to stay
That old rocking chair's going to get me
Every night I pray
That the Lord above will let me
Walk in the sunlight once more

I can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all of the time

Keeps rainin' all of the time

"I Wish I Were In Love Again"

The sleepless nights
The daily fights
The quick toboggan when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates
The endless waits
The lovely loving and the hateful hates
The conversations with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain
No no more strain
Now I'm sane
But I'd rather be punch drunk

The flying fur of cat and cur
The fine mismatching of a him and her
I've learned my lesson but
I wish I were in love again

The furtive sigh
The blackened eye
The words I love you 'til the day I die
The self-deception that believes that lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals
It soon reveals
The faint aroma of performing seals
The double-crossing of a pair of heels
I wish I were in love again

No more care
No more despair
Now I'm all there
But I'd rather be punch drunk

Believe me sir, I much prefer
The classic battle of a him and her
I don't like quiet and I wish I were
In love again
In love again

"Both Sides Now"

Rows and floes of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and they snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way that you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions that I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say "I love you" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

Oh, but now old friends they're acting strange
And they shake their heads and they tell me that I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

It's life's illusions that I recall
I really don't know life 
I really don't know life at all

"This Place"

Sparkle on the ocean
Eagle at the top of a tree
Those crazy crows always making a commotion
This land is home to me.

I was talking to my neighbor
He said, "When I get to heaven, if it is not like this,
I'll just hop a cloud and I'm coming right back down here
Back to this heavenly bliss."

You see those lovely hills
They won't be there for long
They're gonna tear 'em down
And sell them to California
Here come the toxic spills
Miners poking all around
When this place looks like a moonscape
Don't say I didn't warn ya...

Money, money, money...
Money makes the trees come down
It makes mountains into molehills
Big money kicks the wide wide world around.

Black bear in the orchard
At night he's in my garbage cans
He's getting so bold but no one wants to shoot him
He's got a right to roam this land.

I feel like Geronimo
I used to be as trusting as Cochise
But the white eyes lies
He's out of whack with nature
And look how far his weapons reach

Spirit of the water
Give us all the courage and the grace
To make genius of this tragedy unfolding
The genius to save this place.

"If I Had A Heart"

Holy war
Genocide
Suicide
Hate and cruelty...
How can this be holy
If I had a heart I'd cry.

These ancient tales...
The good go to heaven
And the wicked ones burn in hell...
Ring the funeral bells
If I had a heart I'd cry.

There's just too many people now
Too little land
Much too much desire
You feel so feeble now
It's so out of hand
Big bombs and barbed wire
We've set our lovely sky
Our lovely sky
On fire

There's just too many people now
And too little land
Too much rage and desire
It makes you feel so feeble now
It's so out of hand-
Big bombs and barbed wire...
Can't you see
Our destiny
We are making this Earth
Our funeral pyre

Holy Earth
How can we heal you
We cover you like a blight...
Strange birds of appetite...
If I had a heart I'd cry.
If I had a heart I'd cry.
If I had a heart I'd cry.

"Hana"

Hana steps out of a storm
Into a stranger's warm, but
Hard-up kitchen
She sees what must be done
So she takes off her coat
Rolls up her sleeves
And starts pitchin' in

Hana has a special knack
For getting people back on the right track
'Cause she knows
They all matter
So she doesn't argue or flatter
She doesn't fight the slights
She takes it on the chin
Like a champ

Hana says when life's a drag
Don't cave in
Don't put up a white flag
Raise up
A white banner
In this manner
Straighten your back
Dig in your heels
And get a good grip on your grief

Hana says, "Don't get me wrong
This is no simple Sunday song
Where God or Jesus comes along
And they save ya."
You've got to be braver than that
You tackle the beast alone
With all its tenacious teeth
Light the lamp

"Bad Dreams"

The cats are in the flower bed
A red hawk rides the sky
I guess I should be happy
Just to be alive...
But we have poisoned everything
And oblivious to it all
The cell phone zombies babble
Through the shopping malls
While condors fall from Indian skies
Whales beach and die in sand...
Bad dreams are good
In the great plan.

You cannot be trusted
Do you even know you're lying
It's dangerous to kid yourself
You go deaf and dumb and blind.
You take with such entitlement.
You give bad attitude.
You have no grace
No empathy
No gratitude

You have no sense of consequence
Oh my head is in my hands...
Bad dreams are good
In the great plan.

Before that altering apple
We were one with everything
No sense of self and other
No self-consciousness.
But now we have to grapple
With our man-made world backfiring
Keeping one eye on our brother's deadly selfishness.

And everyone's a victim
Nobody's hands are clean.
There's so very little left of wild Eden Earth
So near the jaws of our machines.
We live in these electric scabs.
These lesions once were lakes.
No one knows how to shoulder the blame
Or learn from past mistakes...
So who will come to save the day
Mighty Mouse
Superman
Bad dreams are good in the great plan.

"Big Yellow Taxi 2007"

So they paved paradise
And put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel
A boutique
And a swinging night spot.
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot.

They took all the trees
Put 'em in a tree museum
And they charged all the people
An arm and a leg just to see 'em
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot.

Hey farmer
Put away your DDT
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and bees
Please
Don't it always seem to go
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
And they put up a parking lot.

Late last night
I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi come and took away my old man.
Don't it always seem to go
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot.

"Night Of The Iguana"

The tour bus came yesterday
The driver's a mess today
It's a dump of a destiny
But it's got a view...
Now the kid in the see-through blouse
Is moving in hard on his holy vows...
Since the preacher's not dead
Dead drunk will have to do

Night of the iguana
The jasmine is so mercilessly sweet
Night of the iguana
Can you hear the castanets
The widow is dancing
Down on the beach

The starlight is steaming
He'd like to be dreaming
His senses are screaming
Not to be denied...
But if the spell of the night should win
He could lose his bus
For the same sweet sin
That took his church from him
Then how will he survive

Night of the iguana
The jasmine is so mercilessly sweet
Night of the iguana
Can you hear the castanets
It's the widow and her lover-boys
Down on the beach

The night is so fragrant
These women so flagrant
They could make him a vagrant
With the flick of a shawl.
The devil's in sweet sixteen
The widow's good looking but she gets mean
He's burning like Augustine
With no help from God at all

"Strong And Wrong"

Strong and wrong you win--
Only because
That's the way its always been.
Men love war
That's what history' s for.
History...
A mass--murder mystery...
His story

Strong and wrong
You lose everything
Without the heart
You need
To hear a robin sing
Where have all the songbirds gone
Gone
All I hear are crows in flight
Singing might is right
Might is right

Oh the dawn of man comes slow
Thousands of years
And here we are...
Still worshiping
Our own ego

Strong and wrong
What is God's will
Onward Christian soldiers...
Or thou shall not kill...
Men love war
Is that what God is for
Just a Rabbit's foot
Just a lucky paw
For shock and awe
Shock and awe

The dawn of man comes slow
Thousands of years
Here we are
Still worshiping
Our own ego
Strong and Wrong
Strong and Wrong

"Shine"

Oh let your little light shine
Let your little light shine
Shine on Vegas and Wall Street
Place your bets
Shine on the fishermen
With nothing in their nets
Shine on rising oceans and evaporating seas
Shine on our Frankenstein technologies
Shine on science
With its tunnel vision
Shine on fertile farmland
Buried under subdivisions

Let your little light shine
Let your little light shine
Shine on the dazzling darkness
That restores us in deep sleep
Shine on what we throw away
And what we keep

Shine on Reverend Pearson
Who threw away
The vain old God
Kept Dickens and Rembrandt and Beethoven
And fresh plowed sod
Shine on good earth, good air, good water
And a safe place
For kids to play
Shine on bombs exploding
Half a mile away

Let your little light shine
Let your little light shine
Shine on world-wide traffic jams
Honking day and night
Shine on another asshole
Passing on the right
Shine on the red light runners
Busy talking on their cell phones
Shine on the Catholic Church
And the prisons that it owns
Shine on all the Churches
They all love less and less
Shine on a hopeful girl
In a dreamy dress

Let your little light shine
Let your little light shine
Shine on good humor
Shine on good will
Shine on lousy leadership
Licensed to kill
Shine on dying soldiers
In patriotic pain
Shine on mass destruction
In some God's name
Shine on the pioneers
Those seekers of mental health
Craving simplicity
They traveled inward
Past themselves
May all their little lights shine

"If"

If you can keep your head
While all about you
People are losing theirs and blaming you
If you can trust yourself
When everybody doubts you
And make allowance for their doubting too

If you can wait
And not get tired of waiting
And when lied about
Stand tall
Don't deal in lies
And when hated
Don't give in to hating back
Don't need to look so good
Don't need to talk too wise

If you can dream
And not make dreams your master
If you can think
And not make intellect your game
If you can meet
With triumph and disaster
And treat those two imposters just the same

If you can force your heart
And nerve and sinew
To serve you
After all of them are gone
And so hold on
When there is nothing in you
Nothing but the will
That's telling you to hold on
Hold on

If you can bear to hear
The truth you've spoken
Twisted and misconstrued
By some smug fool
Or watch your life's work
Torn apart and broken down
And still stoop to build again
With worn out tools

If you can draw a crowd
And keep your virtue
Or walk with Kings
And keep the common touch
If neither enemies nor loving friends
Can hurt you
If everybody counts with you
But none too much

If you can fill the journey
Of a minute
With sixty seconds worth of wonder and delight
Then
The Earth is yours
And everything that's in it
But more than that
I know
You'll be alright
You'll be alright

Cause you've got the fight
You've got the insight
You've got the fight
You've got the insight

"A Melody In Your Name"

Can you still remember how it all began
With clipper ships and pink electric trees
Dawnlight on a skyline bridges' span
Street light on a rooftop memory
Then it was me and spring came
Playing a song of spring rain
A melody in your name
Night now comes much bluer than it used to be
The pink nun sings much sadder than before
She sings that sometimes things aren't what they
Seem to be, like moons reflected on the sixteenth floor
Love is no more, it's ended
Paper and pins won't mend it
Even the moon pretended
There must be a reason, oh, there must be one
Keep your answers, let me find my own
Where do pretty stories get their endings from
If loving always leaves you all alone
Kisses have shown me sorrow
Love is a throne to borrow
Pay for the loan tomorrow

"Anathea"

Laszlo Thea stole a stallion
Stole him from the misty mountains
And they chased him and they caught him
And in iron chains they bound him

Word was sent to Ana Thea
That her brother was in prison
Bring me gold and six fine horses
I will buy my brother's freedom

Judge, oh, judge, please spare my brother
I will give you gold and silver
I don't want your gold and silver
All I want are your sweet favors

Ana Thea, oh my sister
Are you mad with grief and sorrow
He will rob you of your flower
And he'll hang me from the gallows

Ana Thea did not listen
Straight way to the judge went running
In his golden bed at midnight
There she heard the gallows groaning

Curses be that judge so cruel
Thirteen years may he lie bleeding
Thirteen doctors cannot cure him
Thirteen shelves of drugs can't heal him

Ana Thea, Ana Thea
Don't go out into the forest
There among the green pines standing
You will find your brother hanging

"Blue on Blue"

Blue on blue
Sky's in your eyes
Steer you away like I wasn't here
Where do you go when you fantasize
Bet you wish I'd disappear
Leave you to dreaming and leave you alone
Lost in a world that's all your own
Can I come, too
Blue on blue

Dreams like you are making now
Are very hard to share
All I ask is one small favor
Dream a dream and wish me there

Gold on gold, sun in your hair
Spinning the rainbow, weaving the wind
Bluing the dye for the midnight air
Counting the gold at the rainbows end
Rapier princess whispers your name
Out of the time before I came
I'll never know
Gold on gold

Dreams like you are making now
Are very hard to share
All I ask is one small favor
Dream a dream and wish me there

Blue on blue

"Cara's Castle"

If you ever come to our town
On a carousel crusade
And you're tired of fighting windmills with a nail
Cross the fence and join the dragons
Who have never made the grade
Cara's castle and the keepers of a most unholy grail

Oh Cara, Queen of the losers, ruler of the weak
Give the poet what he chooses till he's too dumb to speak

There's a clock upon the mantle
But its hands forget the time
And the windows turn their backs upon the day
And the people in the shadows
Could be all lost friends of mine
Cara's courtiers need no light need no light to lose their way

Oh Cara, Queen of the losers, ruler of the weak
Give the poet what he chooses till he's too dumb to speak

From the end to the beginning
Crippled minds retrace the steps
From the burial to the birth they do retreat
Wonderin' where and when and why
Their souls were slaughtered while they slept
Cara's courtiers know no victory know no victory just defeat

Oh Cara, Queen of the losers, ruler of the weak
Give the poet what he chooses till he's too dumb to speak

One by one the battered soldiers
Go slowly cross the moat
One by one they seek new castles somewhere else
With their crutches and the cravens
And I wonder is there hope
Is there hope for Cara's courtiers and the wars against themselves

Oh Cara, Queen of the losers, ruler of the weak
Give the poet what he chooses till he's too dumb to speak

"Circle Game"

Yesterday a child came out to wonder
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
And tearful at the falling of a star

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
Skated over ten clear frozen streams
Words like when you're older must appease him
And promises of someday make his dreams

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
Cartwheels turn to car wheels thru the town
And they tell him take your time it won't be long now
Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
There'll be new dreams maybe better dreams and plenty
Before the last revolving year is through

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

"Copper Kettle"

Get you a copper kettle
Get you a copper coil
Cover with new-made corn mash
And never more you'll toil

You'll just lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-fillin'
In the pale moonlight

Get you a fire of hickory
Get you a fire of oak
Don't use no green or rotten wood
They'll find you by the smoke

While you lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-fillin'
In the pale moonlight

My grandpappy he made whiskey
My daddy he made it too
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792

We just lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-fillin'
In the pale moonlight

Get you a copper kettle
Get you a copper coil
Cover with new-made corn mash
And never more you will toil

You'll just lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-fillin'
In the pale moonlight

"Day After Day"

Day after day
Miles and miles of railroad track
Night after night
Hummin' of the wheels
Their hummin' seems to say
He'll follow you someday
But someday seems a million miles away
Wish I could turn around
And run back home again
I've had no mercy
Since the blues got on this train

Day after day
Make a dollar, need it twice
Night after night
Lie awake and dream
Of days of auld lang syne
Moonlight through the pine
And linen table cloths all stained with wine
Wish I could turn around
And run back home again
I've been so empty
Since I caught that eastbound train

Day after day
Watch the hands move 'round the clock
Night after night
Searching for my soul
So this must be my fate
To sit and weep and wait
And pray my darlin' comes before too late
Wish I could turn around
And run back home again
I've been so lonely
Since I caught that eastbound train

"Dr. Junk"

Dr. Junk the Dentist Man
Fills your teeth with what he can
Airplane wings and corset stays
And when he's done he'll let you pay
In paper clips or inner tubes
Or anything that's slightly used
He's not really crazy
Only nuts and bolts
And rusty rings make him do
The strangest things

Dr. Junk the Dentist has
An office full of colored glass
A garden with a paddle wheel
And funny plants for eye appeal
And though he watches them with care
I've never seen them growing there
He's not really crazy
Only nuts and bolts
And rusty rings make him do
Eccentric things

Dr. Junk the Dentist built
A junky castle up on stilts
Junk within and junk throughout
And TV in the chimney spout
And fourteen levels to each floor
And now he's adding fourteen more
He's not really crazy
Only nuts and bolts
And rusty rings make him do
The strangest things

"Eastern Rain"

Rain comes from the east one night
We watch it come
To hang like beaded curtains
Till the morning sun
Water dripping from our clothes
You with raindrops on your nose
Ask me sadly "Please don't go away now"
Till the rain is done, I say
"I'll stay now"

Rain outside but inside we don't mind at all
Shadows by the fire slowly climb and fall
Kisses fade and leave no trace
Whispers vanish into space
The dawn will send me on a chase to nowhere
Why cry as if I were the first to go there

And I know I shouldn't be here
Yes, I know I should go home
But that eastern rain drones in my brain
And I'm so all alone, so all alone

Morning comes up from the east
We watch it come
And far away now rolls the ancient rain God's drum
You with daybreak in your eyes
Afraid to speak for telling lies
I watch you search for some reply to lend me
But when the rain is done
There's no pretending

And I know I shouldn't be here
Yes, I know I should go home
But that eastern rain drones in my brain
And I'm so all alone, so all alone

"Fare Thee Well (Dink's Song)"

If I had wings like Noah's dove
I'd fly that river to the one I love
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

I've got a man, and he's long and tall
Moves his body like a cannon ball
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

They gave me a new man to share my bed
Sometimes I wish that I was dead
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

One of these mornings I know he's gonna set me free
There'll be no more auction block for me
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

Yes one of these mornings and it won't be long
Them white bosses gonna find me gone
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

"Favorite Colour"

I met a child a year ago
Whose eyes would never see
She asked me with a timid smile
"What colour is a tree"

"In summertime a tree is green
In autumn gold and red
In winter they are frosted white
When all their leaves are shed."

"I know the sky is blue," she said
"And silver is the sand
And apples are the brightest red
What colour is a man"

"Man is many colours child
Some are yellow, some are brown
And some are black as sightlessness
Some white as eiderdown."

She took her crayons from a box
And placed them in my glove
And said, "By mixing all of these
Comes my favourite colour - love."

"Gemini Twin"

Write me a royal blue parchment poem
Draw me a royal blue lady like me
Draw me a smile
That's a lot like my own
And make my eyes flowers
And make my mind see
I will weave melodies only for you
And color them silver and saffron and blue

Build me a window to watch everything
Leave it unshuttered so nothing slips by
No season, no sorrow, no wonderful thing
No raspberry, strawberry sun in the sky
I will bring music and marsipan bars
And live deep inside you
Wherever you are

Teach me the ways of the Gemini twin
Show me the love that he says without words
Bring me his laughter again and again
The silence is singing, the quiet is heard
I will find harmonies waiting unsung
With two souls to sing them
Where once there was one

"Here Today And Gone Tomorrow"

Love is not a game with me
Played with inconsistency
Though my love turned out to be
Here today and gone tomorrow

Love is like a candlelight
Sometimes flickering sometimes bright
Sometimes burning up the night
Here today and gone tomorrow

Love is something of a rover
Comes to town and takes a lover
Packs his bag and then it's over
Here today and gone tomorrow

Love's a field of sugar cane
Sunshine smiles and teardrop rain
Feed it till it's cut again
Here today and gone tomorrow

Love's a rainbow in the sky
None can reach it, still they try
Rainbow chasing fool am I
Here today and gone tomorrow

Love must be the birds in spring
Only lovers hear them sing
All too soon they're on the wing
Here today and gone tomorrow

No love is not a game with me
Played with inconsistency
Though my love turned out to be
Here today and gone tomorrow

"House Of The Rising Sun"

There is a house in New Orleans
They call The Rising Sun
It's been the ruin of many a poor girl
And me, oh God, for one

If I had listened to what my mama said
I'd be at home today
But I was young and foolish, poor girl
Let a gambler lead me astray

My mother, she's a tailor
She sews those old blue jeans
My father, he's a gamblin' man
Drinks down in New Orleans

Go tell my baby sister
Not to do as I have done
You shun that house in New Orleans
They call it The Rising Sun

Well, I'm going back to New Orleans
My race is almost run
I'm going to spend the rest of my days
Beneath that Rising Sun

Well, one foot is on the platform
And the other one's on the train
I'm going to spend the rest of my days
Wearing that ball and chain

"Hunter"

I was alone and sickly
It was a quarter of a moonlit night
I heard him cry through my window shade
And it filled me so full of fright
But I could not turn my back on him
I put on the back porch light
"Can I help you" said the Good Samaritan
"Can I help you" said the Good Samaritan

I brought him bread and a blanket
But I told him "You can't come in"
You can sleep outside in the tool shed
Though a little rain comes in
Oh, I don't know you, you're a stranger
I don't know where you've been
"You can't come in here" said the keeper of the inn
"I don't want you in here," said the keeper of the inn

But I couldn't sleep for the thinking
You know my night got so insane
I thought, maybe he was an angel
And I left him out in the rain
And what if he was the devil
He'd be coming after me again
But when I woke in the weary morning he was gone
When I woke in the weary morning he was gone

I thought maybe he was an angel
And I left him out in the rain
And what if he was the devil
He'd be coming after me again
When I woke in the weary morning he was gone
When I woke in the weary morning, Lord, he was gone

"John Hardy"

John Hardy was a fightin' man
Carried a razor everyday
Well he killed a man in Mobile town
You ought to see my Johnny get away
Ought to see my Johnny get away

Well get away, get away
Poor John, poor John

John Hardy was standin' at the bar
So drunk he could not see
Along came a man with a warrant in his hand
Cryin' Johnny boy why don't you come with me
Johnny boy why don't you come with me

Well get away, get away
Poor John, poor John

John Hardy had a pretty little girl
Kept her dressed in blue
Saw her in the hangin' crowd
Cryin' Johnny boy I'll be true to you
Johnny boy I'll be true to you

Well get away, get away
Poor John, poor John

I've been to the north and I've been to the south
Been this whole world 'round
Well I've lived in the east and I've lived in the west
And this will be my buryin' ground
This will be my buryin' ground

Yes I've been this wild world over
Yes I've been this whole world 'round
And I've been to the river
And I've been baptized
Take me to my buryin' grounds

Well get away, get away
Poor John, poor John, poor John

"Let It Be Me"

Old Mister Wind - hear him howl
Even the moon seems to scowl
Even the skies seem to sympathize
As they weep into
Their leafy cryin' towel

I didn't sleep last night
Room is gettin' light
That old sun I see
Just arisin' here for me
Will be settin' someplace else
For you tonight

You're a rambler a rover
You've been this wild world over
All you ask of life is to be free
When those boots I've been lickin'
Feel a little more like stickin'
Please let it be here and let it be me

Maybe if the day you left this town
I'd acted more the lover less the clown
Maybe if I'd cried those tears I'd learn to hide
I'd be with you on that road you're fadin' down

You're a rambler a rover
You've been this wild world over
All you ask of life is to be free
When those boots I've been lickin'
Feel a little more like stickin'
Please let it be here and let it be me
Please let it be here and let it be me

"Like The Lonely Swallow"

Kiss me on a Sunday
A hop and skip and run day
And though he left on Monday
His kiss stayed lingering

In the days to follow
My heart became a hollow
And like the lonely swallow
I've but one song to sing
Of happy sorrow only love can bring

Letter came on Tuesday
Goodbye to those blues days
He asked me that good new day
To catch the Wednesday train

Hands of clock are lagging
Hours pass a dragging
Warning tongues are wagging
You'll break your heart again
But I know this love
Would never bring me pain

Often while we wander
My love and I do ponder
Which of us is fonder
Of the new love each has found

I say he's the baker
The makes the wonder awaken
Take the refuge that she's seekin
From the stormy world around
And forget the lonely places
She was bound

"Like Veils Said Lorriane"

"It's the veils you tear off one by one," said Lorraine
"No, it's walls we put up," said that tired voice again
The chisel gets blunt and the sword gets profane
Nobody's blame
But you bind up the stone chips in the gauze that you've slain

You get so discouraged trying to cut thru it all
More veils beyond veils, always walls behind the walls
"Get back in there" yells the golden glove
"When you gonna trust me," slams the friend
"Learn how to bend"
"Don't you worry now," soothes the sweet lover with his medicine hands

Oh, I don't want to grow narrow and foolish in old age
And miss all that beauty, the wisdom and the grace
And you know you don't get that from high finance or fame
If you get stuck in that frame
Or the paint that you can put on your face and your name

"Love Or Money"

The firmament of Tinsel Town
Is strung with tungsten stars
Lot's of forty watt successes
He says where's my own shining hour
He's the well kept secret of the underground
He's in debt to the company store
Because his only channelled aspiration
Was getting back that girl he had before
He's got stacks and stacks of words that rhyme
Describing what it is to lose
He's got some just for laughs
He's got some for love
That mainline to his blues
Some to shed a little light on you and on me
Some to shed a little light on the human story

The wars of pride and property
The rebel Irish and the promised land Jew
Fighting behind his eyes and over seas
Wounded in action and no ceasefire in view
Brave reporters bring the battles home
But tonight inside that box
Just more bang bang ketchup color to him
Just more Twentieth Century Fox
All because that ghostly girl comes haunting
Just out of reach-outside his bed
And she kicks the covers off his sleep
For the clumsy things he said
She commands his head-She tries his sanity
She demands his head-Tonight unknowingly

Vaguely she floats and lacelike
Blown in like a curtain on the night wind
She's nebulous and naked
He wonders where she's been
He grabs at the air because there's nothing there
Her evasiveness stings him
With long legs-long lonely legs
Bruised from banging into things
One day he was standing just outside her door
He was carrying an armload of bright balloons
She just laughed
She said she heard him knocking
And she teased him for the moon
"Is one the moon, dear clown,
Tied to a string for me"
He tried but he could not get it down
For truth or for mystery
He tried but he could not get it down
For love or money

"Me And My Uncle"

Me and my uncle went ridin' down
From Colorado, west Texas bound
And we stopped off in Santa Fe
It bein' the place about half way
And besides it was the hottest part of the day

We led our ponies into a stall
Went to the bar, boys, bought drinks for all
Two days in the saddle, my body hurt
It being summer, took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

West Texas cowboys, all over town
With gold and silver, they're loaded down
Just in from roundup, it seemed a shame
And so my uncle starts a friendly game
Now it's hollow jack and winner take the game

From the beginning, uncle starts to win
Them Texas cowboys, they was mad as sin
Some say he's cheatin', that can't be
'Cause my uncle, he's as honest as me
And I'm as honest as a Denver gal can be

One Texas cowboy, he starts to draw
I grabbed a bottle, slapped him on the jaw
I shot another, he won't grow old
In the confusion, uncle grabbed the gold
And we hightailed it down to Mexico

Now God bless cowboys, and God bless gold
God bless my uncle, and rest his soul
He taught me well boys, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, boys, I grabbed that gold
And I left him lyin' there, I left him lyin' there
I left him lyin' there by the side of the road

"Molly Malone"

In Dublin's fair city
Where girls are so pretty
It was there that I first met sweet Molly Malone
She wheeled her wheelbarrow
Through the streets broad and narrow
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"

Alive, alive, oh
Alive, alive, oh
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"

Now she was a fishmonger
And sure, t'was no wonder
For her father and mother
Were fishmongers too
And they both wheeled their barrow
Through the streets broad and narrow
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"

Alive, alive, oh
Alive, alive, oh
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"

Now she died of a fever
And no one could save her
Was then that I lost sweet Molly Malone
Now her ghost wheels her barrow
Through streets broad and narrow
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"

Alive, alive, oh
Alive, alive, oh
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"

"Nancy Whiskey"

I am a weaver a Calton Weaver
I am a rash and a rovin' blade
I've got silver in my pooches
I'll gang follow the weaver's trade
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

Now I rolled into Glasgow City
Nancy Whisky I chanced to smell
I went in, sat doon beside her
Seven long years I loved her well
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

Now the more I kissed her the more I loved her
The more I kissed her the more she smiled
I set forth on my mother's teachin'
Nancy soon had me beguiled
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

Now I rose the early morning
To quench my thirst it was my need
I tried to rise but I was not able
Nancy had me by the heid
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

Now I'm going back to the Calton weaving
I'll surely make those shuttles fly
I'll earn more at the Calton weavin
Than that I did in days gone by
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

So come all you weavers, ye Calton Weavers
Come all you weavers where e're you be
Beware of Whisky Nancy Whisky
She'll ruin you as she ruined me
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

"Passion Play (The Story Of Jesus And achius...The Little Tax Collector)"

Magdalene is trembling
Like a washing on a line
Trembling and gleaming
Never before was a man so kind
Never so redeeming

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue
In radiation rose
Ecstasy
Now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free
(Who're you gonna get)

I am up a sycamore
Looking through the leaves
A sinner of some position
Who in the world can this heart healer be
This magical physician

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue
In radiation rose
Misery
Now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free
(Who're you gonna get)

Enter the multitudes
The walking wounded
They come to this diver of the heart
of the multitudes
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done

Oh climb down climb down he says to me
From the middle of unrest
They think his light is squandered
But he sees a stray in the wilderness
And I see how far I've wandered

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue
In radiation rose
Apathy
Now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free
(Who're you gonna get)

Enter the multitudes
The walking wounded
They come to this diver of the heart
of the multitudes
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done

Oh all around the marketplace
The buzzing of the flies
The buzzing and the stinging
Divinely barren
And wickedly wise
The killer nails are ringing

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue
In radiation rose
Tragedy
Now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free
(Who're you gonna get)

"Pat's Solo"

This is my solo...
Excuse me Sir...would you please take your seat,
I'm playing my solo... no I'm serious can't you see I'm playing a solo here...
Hey buddy sit down so I can concentrate on my solo....
Ok that's it, you would think that an artist could play a solo once in a while without any interuptions. Here...you take my guitar and show us what is so important...
What You work here, you're the usher
Oooook, sorry, soooo I'll just play my solo then.

"Real Good for Free"

I slept last night in a good hotel
I went shopping today for jewels
The wind rushed around in the dirty town
And the children let out from the schools
I was standing on a noisy corner
Waiting for the walking green
Across the street he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet, for free.

Now me I play for fortune
And those velvet curtain calls
I've got a black limousine
And two gentlemen
Escorting me to the halls
And I play if you have the money

Or if you're a friend to me
But the one man band
By the quick lunch stand
He was playing real good, for free.

Nobody stopped to hear him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never
Been on their t.v.
So they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony...
I heard his refrain
As the signal changed
He was playing real good, for free.

"Sad Winds Blowin'"

Gone, just as lonely as before
There's his smoke against the ceiling
And his ashes on the floor
Gone golden genie in the blaze of a thousand sorries
Ashes and smoke are all that's staying
They'll soon be going
With the sad winds blowin'

Dark, strike a match and light a candle
Candles always look so hopeful
But it's more than I can handle

Dark, strike a match and light a candle
Candles always look so hopeful
But it's more than I can handle
Cry for a river from the sun
It's just as easy
Flame on the candle's almost done
It'll soon be going
With the sad winds blowin'

Times, just a senseless lot of ticking
She's the master of our people

Ah, if that's good enough for you, I don't know

"Seven Daffodils"

I haven't got a mansion
Nor have I any land
Not one single dollar
To crinkle in my hand

But I can show you the morning, on a thousand hills
And kiss you, and give you seven daffodils

I haven't got a fortune
To buy you pretty things
But I can make you moonbeams
Into necklaces and rings

But I can show you the morning, on a thousand hills
And kiss you, and give you seven daffodils

Yes, seven pretty daffodils
Are shining in the sun
To light our way to evening
And when the day is done
I will give you kisses, three
And a crust of bread
And a pillow of piny boughs to rest your head

No I haven't got a mansion
Nor have I any land
Not one single dollar
To crinkle in my hands

But I can show you the morning, on a thousand hills
And kiss you, and give you seven daffodils
And kiss you, and give you seven daffodils

"Strawflower Me"

Look at me
Won't you tell me what you see
Behind the tinsel flower lady
That you made me feel I must be

Don't you know
Even tinsel flowers grow uneasy
Shining all the time
Sometimes they find they can't even glow

Could you love a blue straw-flower
With no mystic magic power
Would you miss the glitter of your fantasy
You know she isn't really me, baby

Just to please you
Maybe I can be a silver rose
But don't you know it's only straw-flower me

Could you love a blue straw-flower
With no mystic magic power
Would you miss the glitter of your fantasy
You know she isn't really me, baby, baby, baby

"Tell Old Bill"

Tell old Bill when he gets home this morning
Tell old Bill when he gets home this evening
Tell old Bill when he gets home
Leave those downtown girls alone
This morning, this evening, so soon

Old Bill's wife she was bakin' bread this morning
Old Bill's wife she was bakin' bread this evening
Old Bill's wife she was bakin' bread
When she found out that Bill was dead
This morning, this evening, so soon

She said oh no it can't be so this morning
She said oh no it can't be so this evening
She said oh no it can't be so
Bill left home about an hour ago
This morning, this evening, so soon

They brought Bill home in a hurry-up wagon this morning
Brought Bill home in a hurry-up wagon this evening
Brought Bill home in a hurry-up wagon
Brought him home with his feet a-draggin'
This morning, this evening, so soon

Tell old Bill when he gets home
Leave those downtown girls alone
This morning, this evening, so soon
This morning, this evening, so soon

"Ten Thousand Miles"

Oh, fare thee well I must be gone
And leave you for a while
Wherever I go, I will return
If I go
If I go ten thousand miles
If I go
If I go
If I go ten thousand miles

Oh, the crow that is so black my love
Would change his color white
If ever I'm false to the boy I love
Day, day would turn to night
Yes, the day
Oh, the day
Yes, the day would turn to night

Oh, the rivers never will run dry
Or the rocks melt with the sun
I'll never be false to the boy I love
Tell all, all these things be done
Tell all
No, tell all
Tell all these things be done

Fare thee well
Fare thee well
Fare thee well, my love

"The Long Black Rifle"

Come closer, my love
And I'll tell you a tale
It'll make you cold
It'll turn you pale
It's a tale of a man's
Never ending love
And the long black rifle

He wed a woman
Sworn to another
And, in a rage
The other man
Shot him down
With a long black rifle
Shot him down
And away he ran

Now a prairie man
Loved a city maid
Was the love he took
Worth the price he paid
When a man ends up
At the smoking end
Of a long black rifle

He wed a woman
Sworn to another
And, in a rage
The other man
Shot him down
With a long black rifle
Shot him down
And away he ran

Now his dyin' words
I repeat to you
You can never kill love
When your love is true
It lives when only
The rust is left
Of the long black rifle

He wed a woman
Sworn to another
And, in a rage
The other man
Shot him down
With a long black rifle
Shot him down
And away he ran

"The Student Song"

Here I sit a-learnin'
Candlelight a-burnin'
Castin' flickerin' shadows on the wall
Open book before me
Tryin' its best to bore me
Up in the hills the lonesome coyote's call
Cryin' for his sweetheart
Cryin' for the moon
Cryin' just for cryin's sake
He'll have me cryin' soon
Wonder if he's lonely
Guess I'm not the only
Creature on this earth who's all alone

Spring's creepin' up the valley
And I know my best pal he's
Up there somewhere catching fireflies
But my lesson's ain't completed and I
Just can't be defeated
By the sights and sounds
That tease my ears and eyes
Outside my window
The night is full of sounds
Hootin' of a hooting owl
Layin' of my hounds

But here I sit a-learnin'
And grumblin' and gol durnin'
Ain't gonna help these lessons to go by

Eight times twelve how many
And here's a guy called Benny
Flew a kite into a lightnin' storm
Who killed ole cock robin
While all the birds were sobbin'
Gee that evenin' air smells sweet and warm
Who can study silly words
When the creek begins to run
And the crocus pops up from the ground
I challenge anyone

Now it's off to school tomorrow with
Apologies and sorrow
But I've gotta watch the season being born
Yes I've gotta watch the season being born
I've gotta watch the season being born

"Urge For Going"

I awoke today and found the frost
perched on the town
It hovered in a frozen sky, then it
gobbled summer down
When the sun turns traitor cold and all 
the trees are shivering in a naked row

I get the urge for going
But I never seem to go
I get the urge for going 
When the meadow grass is turning brown
Summertime is falling down and winter
is closing in

I had me a man in summertime
He had summer-colored skin
And not another girl in town 
My darling's heart could win
But when the leaves fell on the ground
Boy winds came around, pushed them face
down in the snow

He got the urge for going
And I had to let him go
He got the urge for going
When the meadow grass was turning brown
Summertime was falling down and winter
was closing in

Now the warriors of winter they gave a 
cold triumphant shout
And all that stays is dying and all that
lives is camping out
See the geese in chevron flight flapping 
and racing on before the snow

They got the urge for going
And they got the wings so they can go
They get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
Summertime is falling down and winter
is closing in

Apply the fire with kindling now
I'll pull the blankets up to my chin
I'll lock the vagrant winter out and
I'll fold my wandering in
I'd like to call back summertime
Have her stay for just another 
month or so

But she's got the urge for gong
So I guess she'll have to go
She gets the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
All her empire's falling down
And winter's closing in
And I get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
And summertime is falling down

"What Will You Give Me"

What will you give me for one prairie night
Silver fields and meadows and the moon's silver light
Mister cat in the hay loft with silvery eye
All these precious possessions I'll sell, if you'll buy

What will you give me for one prairie day
The golden fields of autumn and the primrose in May
Sun's courtin' meadowlarks, off in the sky
All those precious possessions I'll sell if you'll buy

What will you give me for one prairie breeze
Rippling the grasses and rustling the trees
Wafting the scent of the newly mown hay
All those precious possessions I'll sell if you'll pay

What will you give me for one prairie sky
An amethyst sea with cloud galleons sailing by
The aurora dancing on cold winter nights
All these precious possessions I'll sell for a price

What will you give me for one prairie day
With the earth cracked and smokin'
Where we'd crossed yesterday
Gone the birds from the air, gone the child I begot
All those precious possessions I sold, and for what

"Why Do Fools Fall In Love"

Why do fools fall in love
Why do birds sing so gay
And lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love
Why does the rain fall from up above
Why do fools fall in love
Why do they fall in love
Love is a losing game
Love can be a shame
I know of a fool you see
For that fool is me
Tell me why
Tell my why

Why do birds sing so gay
And lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love
Why does the rain fall from up above
Why do fools fall in love
Why do they fall in love
Why does my heart skip this crazy beat
For I know
It will reach defeat
Tell me why
tell me why
Why do fools fall in love

"Suzanne"

Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river 
You can hear the boats go by 
You can spend the night beside her 
And you know that she's half crazy 
But that's why you want to be there 
And she feeds you tea and oranges 
That come all the way from China 
And just when you mean to tell her 
That you have no love to give her 
Then she gets you on her wavelength 
And she lets the river answer 
That you've always been her lover 
And you want to travel with her 
And you want to travel blind 
And you know that she will trust you 
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind. 
And Jesus was a sailor 
When he walked upon the water 
And he spent a long time watching 
From his lonely wooden tower 
And when he knew for certain 
Only drowning men could see him 
He said "All men will be sailors then 
Until the sea shall free them" 
But he himself was broken 
Long before the sky would open 
Forsaken, almost human 
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone 
And you want to travel with him 
And you want to travel blind 
And you think maybe you'll trust him 
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind. 

Now Suzanne takes your hand 
And she leads you to the river 
She is wearing rags and feathers 
From Salvation Army counters 
And the sun pours down like honey 
On our lady of the harbour 
And she shows you where to look 
Among the garbage and the flowers 
There are heroes in the seaweed 
There are children in the morning 
They are leaning out for love 
And they will lean that way forever 
While Suzanne holds the mirror 
And you want to travel with her 
And you want to travel blind 
And you know that you can trust her 
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind.

"Master Song"

I believe that you heard your master sing 
when I was sick in bed. 
I suppose that he told you everything 
that I keep locked away in my head. 
Your master took you travelling, 
well at least that's what you said. 
And now do you come back to bring 
your prisoner wine and bread 
You met him at some temple, where 
they take your clothes at the door. 
He was just a numberless man in a chair 
who'd just come back from the war. 
And you wrap up his tired face in your hair 
and he hands you the apple core. 
Then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare 
of all the kisses we put on some time before. 

And he gave you a German Shepherd to walk 
with a collar of leather and nails, 
and he never once made you explain or talk 
about all of the little details, 
such as who had a word and who had a rock, 
and who had you through the mails. 
Now your love is a secret all over the block, 
and it never stops not even when your master fails. 

And he took you up in his aeroplane, 
which he flew without any hands, 
and you cruised above the ribbons of rain 
that drove the crowd from the stands. 
Then he killed the lights in a lonely Lane 
and, an ape with angel glands, 
erased the final wisps of pain 
with the music of rubber bands. 

And now I hear your master sing, 
you kneel for him to come. 
His body is a golden string 
that your body is hanging from. 
His body is a golden string, 
my body has grown numb. 
Oh now you hear your master sing, 
your shirt is all undone. 

And will you kneel beside this bed 
that we polished so long ago, 
before your master chose instead 
to make my bed of snow 
Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red 
and you're speaking far too low. 
No I can't make out what your master said 
before he made you go. 

Then I think you're playing far too rough 
for a lady who's been to the moon 
I've lain by this window long enough 
to get used to an empty room. 
And your love is some dust in an old man's cough 
who is tapping his foot to a tune, 
and your thighs are a ruin, you want too much, 
let's say you came back some time too soon. 

I loved your master perfectly 
I taught him all that he knew. 
He was starving in some deep mystery 
like a man who is sure what is true. 
And I sent you to him with my guarantee 
I could teach him something new, 
and I taught him how you would long for me 
no matter what he said no matter what you'd do. 

I believe that you heard your master sing 
while I was sick in bed, 
I'm sure that he told you everything 
I must keep locked away in my head. 
Your master took you travelling, 
well at least that's what you said, 
And now do you come back to bring 
your prisoner wine and bread

"Winter Lady"

Trav'ling lady, stay awhile 
until the night is over. 
I'm just a station on your way, 
I know I'm not your lover. 
Well I lived with a child of snow 
when I was a soldier, 
and I fought every man for her 
until the nights grew colder. 

She used to wear her hair like you 
except when she was sleeping, 
and then she'd weave it on a loom 
of smoke and gold and breathing. 

And why are you so quiet now 
standing there in the doorway 
You chose your journey long before 
you came upon this highway. 

Trav'ling lady stay awhile 
until the night is over. 
I'm just a station on your way, 
I know I'm not your lover.

"Stranger Song"

It's true that all the men you knew were dealers
Who said they were through with dealing
Every time you gave them shelter
I know that kind of man
It's hard to hold the hand of anyone
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much
Not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card
That is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger

And then leaning on your window sill
He'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet
An old schedule of trains, he'll say
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger

But now another stranger seems
To want you to ignore his dreams
As though they were the burden of some other
Oh, you've seen that man before
His golden arm dispatching cards
But now it's rusted from the elbow to the finger
And he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter
Yes, he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter

Ah, you hate to watch another tired man
Lay down his hand
Like he was giving up the holy game of poker
And while he talks his dreams to sleep
You notice there's a highway
That is curling up like smoke above his shoulder
It's curling just like smoke above his shoulder

You tell him to come in, sit down
But something makes you turn around
The door is open, you can't close your shelter
You try the handle of the road
It opens, do not be afraid
It's you my love, you who are the stranger
It is you my love, you who are the stranger

Well, I've been waiting, I was sure
We'd meet between the trains we're waiting for
I think it's time to board another
Please understand, I never had a secret chart
To get me to the heart of this
Or any other matter
While he talks like this, you don't know what he's after
When he speaks like this, you don't know what he's after

Let's meet tomorrow if you choose
Upon the shore, beneath the bridge
That they are building on some endless river
Then he leaves the platform
For the sleeping car that's warm
You realize, he's only advertising one more shelter
And it comes to you, he never was a stranger
And you say, "OK, the bridge or some place later."

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much
Not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card
That is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger

And leaning on your window sill
He'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet
An old schedule of trains, he'll say
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger

"Sisters Of Mercy"

Oh the sisters of mercy, they are not departed or gone. 
They were waiting for me when I thought that I just can't go on. 
And they brought me their comfort and later they brought me this song. 
Oh I hope you run into them, you who've been travelling so long. 
Yes you who must leave everything that you cannot control. 
It begins with your family, but soon it comes around to your soul. 
Well I've been where you're hanging, I think I can see how you're pinned 
When you're not feeling holy, your loneliness says that you've sinned. 

Well they lay down beside me, I made my confession to them. 
They touched both my eyes and I touched the dew on their hem. 
If your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn 
they will bind you with love that is graceful and green as a stem. 

When I left they were sleeping, I hope you run into them soon. 
Don't turn on the lights, you can read their address by the moon. 
And you won't make me jealous if I hear that they sweetened your night 
We weren't lovers like that and besides it would still be all right, 
We weren't lovers like that and besides it would still be all right.

"So Long Marianne"

Come over to the window, my little darling, 
I'd like to try to read your palm. 
I used to think I was some kind of Gypsy boy 
before I let you take me home. 
Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began 
to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again. 

Well you know that I love to live with you, 
but you make me forget so very much. 
I forget to pray for the angels 
and then the angels forget to pray for us. 

Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ... 

We met when we were almost young 
deep in the green lilac park. 
You held on to me like I was a crucifix, 
as we went kneeling through the dark. 

Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ... 

Your letters they all say that you're beside me now. 
Then why do I feel alone 
I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web 
is fastening my ankle to a stone. 

Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ... 

For now I need your hidden love. 
I'm cold as a new razor blade. 
You left when I told you I was curious, 
I never said that I was brave. 

Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ... 

Oh, you are really such a pretty one. 
I see you've gone and changed your name again. 
And just when I climbed this whole mountainside, 
to wash my eyelids in the rain 

Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ...

"Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye"

I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm, 
your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm, 
yes, many loved before us, I know that we are not new, 
in city and in forest they smiled like me and you, 
but now it's come to distances and both of us must try, 
your eyes are soft with sorrow, 
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye. 
I'm not looking for another as I wander in my time, 
walk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme 
you know my love goes with you as your love stays with me, 
it's just the way it changes, like the shoreline and the sea, 
but let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie, 
your eyes are soft with sorrow, 
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye. 

I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm, 
your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm, 
yes many loved before us, I know that we are not new, 
in city and in forest they smiled like me and you, 
but let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie, 
your eyes are soft with sorrow, 
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye.

"Stories Of The Street"

The stories of the street are mine,the Spanish voices laugh. 
The Cadillacs go creeping now through the night and the poison gas, 
and I lean from my window sill in this old hotel I chose, 
yes one hand on my suicide, one hand on the rose. 
I know you've heard it's over now and war must surely come, 
the cities they are broke in half and the middle men are gone. 
But let me ask you one more time, O children of the dusk, 
All these hunters who are shrieking now oh do they speak for us 

And where do all these highways go, now that we are free 
Why are the armies marching still that were coming home to me 
O lady with your legs so fine O stranger at your wheel, 
You are locked into your suffering and your pleasures are the seal. 

The age of lust is giving birth, and both the parents ask 
the nurse to tell them fairy tales on both sides of the glass. 
And now the infant with his cord is hauled in like a kite, 
and one eye filled with blueprints, one eye filled with night. 

O come with me my little one, we will find that farm 
and grow us grass and apples there and keep all the animals warm. 
And if by chance I wake at night and I ask you who I am, 
O take me to the slaughterhouse, I will wait there with the lamb. 

With one hand on the hexagram and one hand on the girl 
I balance on a wishing well that all men call the world. 
We are so small between the stars, so large against the sky, 
and lost among the subway crowds I try to catch your eye.

"Teachers"

I met a woman long ago 
her hair the black that black can go, 
Are you a teacher of the heart 
Soft she answered no. 
I met a girl across the sea, 
her hair the gold that gold can be, 
Are you a teacher of the heart 
Yes, but not for thee. 

I met a man who lost his mind 
in some lost place I had to find, 
follow me the wise man said, 
but he walked behind. 

I walked into a hospital 
where none was sick and none was well, 
when at night the nurses left 
I could not walk at all. 

Morning came and then came noon, 
dinner time a scalpel blade 
lay beside my silver spoon. 

Some girls wander by mistake 
into the mess that scalpels make. 
Are you the teachers of my heart 
We teach old hearts to break. 

One morning I woke up alone, 
the hospital and the nurses gone. 
Have I carved enough my Lord 
Child, you are a bone. 

I ate and ate and ate, 
no I did not miss a plate, well 
How much do these suppers cost 
We'll take it out in hate. 

I spent my hatred everyplace, 
on every work on every face, 
someone gave me wishes 
and I wished for an embrace. 

Several girls embraced me, then 
I was embraced by men, 
Is my passion perfect 
No, do it once again. 

I was handsome I was strong, 
I knew the words of every song. 
Did my singing please you 
No, the words you sang were wrong. 

Who is it whom I address, 
who takes down what I confess 
Are you the teachers of my heart 
We teach old hearts to rest. 

Oh teachers are my lessons done 
I cannot do another one. 
They laughed and laughed and said, Well child, 
are your lessons done 
are your lessons done 
are your lessons done

"One Of Us Cannot Be Wrong"

I lit a thin green candle, to make you jealous of me. 
But the room just filled up with mosquitos, 
they heard that my body was free. 
Then I took the dust of a long sleepless night 
and I put it in your little shoe. 
And then I confess that I tortured the dress 
that you wore for the world to look through. 
I showed my heart to the doctor he said I just have to quit. 
Then he wrote himself a prescription, 
and your name was mentioned in it 
Then he locked himself in a library shelf 
with the details of our honeymoon, 
and I hear from the nurse that he's gotten much worse 
and his practice is all in a ruin. 

I heard of a saint who had loved you, 
so I studied all night in his school. 
He taught that the duty of lovers 
is to tarnish the golden rule. 
And just when I was sure that his teachings were pure 
he drowned himself in the pool. 
His body is gone but back here on the lawn 
his spirit continues to drool. 

An Eskimo showed me a movie 
he'd recently taken of you 
the poor man could hardly stop shivering, 
his lips and his fingers were blue. 
I suppose that he froze when the wind took your clothes 
and I guess he just never got warm. 
But you stand there so nice, in your blizzard of ice, 
oh please let me come into the storm.

"Store Room"

It's not the wind that keeps you up, it's not the snow
It's not the moon coming like a headlight through your window
It's not the thumbnail of a screen that scrapes away your dream
It's just this man taking what he needs from the store room

It's not the news of burning towns that ruins your mind
Like a spool you turn and you turn but it won't unwind
No these wars you did not start, they don't tear your sleep apart
It's just a man taking what he needs from the store room

And now this woman by your side, well, she's asleep
And there's nothing you can give her and there's nothing you want to keep
You don't even try to prove that the noise is neighbors making love
It's just a man taking what he needs from the store room

Well go to sleep and change the locks when you wake up
Share your toast, maybe spill some coffee from your cup
Oh, there's nothing left to choose and there is so much more to lose
There's this man taking what he needs from the store room

It's not the wind that keeps you up, it's not the snow
It's not the moon coming like a headlight through your window
It's not the thumbnail of a screen that scrapes away your dream
It's just a man taking what he needs from the store room

It's not the news of burning towns that ruins your mind
Like a spool you turn and turn but won't unwind
No these wars you did not start, they don't tear your sleep apart
It's just a man taking what he needs from the store room

And now the woman by your side, well, she's awake
But there's nothing you can give her and there's nothing you want to take
You don't even try to prove that the noise is neighbors making love
It's just a man taking what he needs from the store room

Or go to sleep and change the locks when you wake up
Share your toast, maybe spill a little coffee from your cup
He's got nothing left to choose and you've got so much more to lose
There's just a man taking what he needs from the store room

It's not the wind

"Blessed Is The Memory"

I remember the promise
That you made in the barn
When the kittens were born
And you could not keep warm

So you moved away the mountain
That the sun rose behind
And you said yourself a prayer
And laid down with the blind

But you lost them in your freedom
And you need him now, you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

And the vow of compassion
That you swore through your teeth
When the war began to end
And the photographs weep

Well, nobody blames you
As the train pulls away
With its cargo of snow
For these German paper-weights

But you lost them in your freedom
And you need him now, you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

Well, its five in the morning
There's no one at home
Except for your wife
And your child on the phone

Somebody's got to listen
To a promise or two
Oh, this room is far too small
For a pilgrim like you

But you lost them in your freedom
And you need him now, you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

So, now that you've decided
To follow the sun
Like a shadow of birds
Or a king on the run

Oh, your chains are too dark
For the seas you must swim
You are smiling at the seaweed
But your smile is too grim

But you lost them in your freedom
And you need him now, you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

"Bird On The Wire"

Like a bird on the wire, 
like a drunk in a midnight choir 
I have tried in my way to be free. 
Like a worm on a hook, 
like a knight from some old fashioned book 
I have saved all my ribbons for thee. 
If I, if I have been unkind, 
I hope that you can just let it go by. 
If I, if I have been untrue 
I hope you know it was never to you. 
Like a baby, stillborn, 
like a beast with his horn 
I have torn everyone who reached out for me. 
But I swear by this song 
and by all that I have done wrong 
I will make it all up to thee. 
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch, 
he said to me, "You must not ask for so much." 
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door, 
she cried to me, "Hey, why not ask for more" 

Oh like a bird on the wire, 
like a drunk in a midnight choir 
I have tried in my way to be free.

"Story Of Isaac"

The door it opened slowly, 
my father he came in, 
I was nine years old. 
And he stood so tall above me, 
his blue eyes they were shining 
and his voice was very cold. 
He said, "I've had a vision 
and you know I'm strong and holy, 
I must do what I've been told." 
So he started up the mountain, 
I was running, he was walking, 
and his axe was made of gold. 
Well, the trees they got much smaller, 
the lake a lady's mirror, 
we stopped to drink some wine. 
Then he threw the bottle over. 
Broke a minute later 
and he put his hand on mine. 
Thought I saw an eagle 
but it might have been a vulture, 
I never could decide. 
Then my father built an altar, 
he looked once behind his shoulder, 
he knew I would not hide. 

You who build these altars now 
to sacrifice these children, 
you must not do it anymore. 
A scheme is not a vision 
and you never have been tempted 
by a demon or a god. 
You who stand above them now, 
your hatchets blunt and bloody, 
you were not there before, 
when I lay upon a mountain 
and my father's hand was trembling 
with the beauty of the word. 

And if you call me brother now, 
forgive me if I inquire, 
"Just according to whose plan" 
When it all comes down to dust 
I will kill you if I must, 
I will help you if I can. 
When it all comes down to dust 
I will help you if I must, 
I will kill you if I can. 
And mercy on our uniform, 
man of peace or man of war, 
the peacock spreads his fan.

"A Bunch Of Lonesome Heroes"

A bunch of lonesome and very quarrelsome heroes 
were smoking out along the open road 
the night was very dark and thick between them, 
each man beneath his ordinary load. 
"I'd like to tell my story," 
said one of them so young and bold, 
"I'd like to tell my story, 
before I turn into gold." 
But no one really could hear him, 
the night so dark and thick and green 
well I guess that these heroes must always live there 
where you and I have only been. 
Put out your cigarette, my love, 
you've been alone too long 
and some of us are very hungry now 
to hear what it is you've done that was so wrong. 

I sing this for the crickets, 
I sing this for the army, 
I sing this for your children 
and for all who do not need me. 
"I'd like to tell my story," 
said one of them so bold, 
"Oh yes, I'd like to tell my story 
'cause you know I feel I'm turning into gold."

"The Partisan"

When they poured across the border
I was cautioned to surrender,
this I could not do
I took my gun and vanished.
I have changed my name so often,
I've lost my wife and children
but I have many friends,
and some of them are with me.

An old woman gave us shelter,
kept us hidden in the garret,
then the soldiers came
she died without a whisper.

There were three of us this morning
I'm the only one this evening
but I must go on
the frontiers are my prison.

Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing,
through the graves the wind is blowing,
freedom soon will come
then we'll come from the shadows.

Les Allemands taient chez moi (The Germans were at my home)
ils m'ont dit "Rsigne-toi" (They said, "Surrender,")
mais je n'ai pas pu (this I could not do)
j'ai repris mon arme (I took my weapon again)

J'ai chang cent fois de nom (I have changed names a hundred times)
j'ai perdu femme et enfants (I have lost wife and children)
mais j'ai tant d'amis (But I have so many friends)
j'ai la France entire (I have all of France)

Un vieil homme dans un grenier (An old man, in an attic)
pour la nuit nous a cachs (Hid us for the night)
les Allemands l'ont pris (The Germans captured him)
il est mort sans surprise (He died without surprise)

Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing,
through the graves the wind is blowing,
freedom soon will come
then we'll come from the shadows.

"Seems So Long Ago, Nancy"

It seems so long ago, 
Nancy was alone, 
looking ate the Late Late show 
through a semi-precious stone. 
In the House of Honesty 
her father was on trial, 
in the House of Mystery 
there was no one at all, 
there was no one at all. 
It seems so long ago, 
none of us were strong 
Nancy wore green stockings 
and she slept with everyone. 
She never said she'd wait for us 
although she was alone, 
I think she fell in love for us 
in nineteen sixty one, 
in nineteen sixty one. 

It seems so long ago, 
Nancy was alone, 
a forty five beside her head, 
an open telephone. 
We told her she was beautiful, 
we told her she was free 
but none of us would meet her in 
the House of Mystery, 
the House of Mystery. 

And now you look around you, 
see her everywhere, 
many use her body, 
many comb her hair. 
In the hollow of the night 
when you are cold and numb 
you hear her talking freely then, 
she's happy that you've come, 
she's happy that you've come.

"The Old Revolution"

I finally broke into the prison, 
I found my place in the chain. 
Even damnation is poisoned with rainbows, 
all the brave young men 
they're waiting now to see a signal 
which some killer will be lighting for pay. 
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture, 
you whom I cannot betray. 

I fought in the old revolution 
on the side of the ghost and the King. 
Of course I was very young 
and I thought that we were winning 
I can't pretend I still feel very much like singing 
as they carry the bodies away. 

Into this furnace I ask you now to venture... 

Lately you've started to stutter 
as though you had nothing to say. 
To all of my architects let me be traitor. 
Now let me say I myself gave the order 
to sleep and to search and to destroy. 

Into this furnace I ask you now to venture... 

Yes, you who are broken by power, 
you who are absent all day, 
you who are kings for the sake of your children's story, 
the hand of your beggar is burdened down with money, 
the hand of your lover is clay. 

Into this furnace I ask you now to venture...

"The Butcher"

I came upon a butcher, 
he was slaughtering a lamb, 
I accused him there 
with his tortured lamb. 
He said, "Listen to me, child, 
I am what I am 
and you, you are my only son." 
Well, I found a silver needle, 
I put it into my arm. 
It did some good, 
did some harm. 
But the nights were cold 
and it almost kept me warm, 
how come the night is long 

I saw some flowers growing up 
where that lamb fell down 
was I supposed to praise my Lord, 
make some kind of joyful sound 
He said, "Listen, listen to me now, 
I go round and round 
and you, you are my only child." 

Do not leave me now, 
do not leave me now, 
I'm broken down 
from a recent fall. 
Blood upon my body 
and ice upon my soul, 
lead on, my son, it is your world.

"You Know Who I Am"

I cannot follow you, my love, 
you cannot follow me. 
I am the distance you put between 
all of the moments that we will be. 
You know who I am, 
you've stared at the sun, 
well I am the one who loves 
changing from nothing to one. 

Sometimes I need you naked, 
sometimes I need you wild, 
I need you to carry my children in 
and I need you to kill a child. 

You know who I am... 

If you should ever track me down 
I will surrender there 
and I will leave with you one broken man 
whom I will teach you to repair. 

You know who I am... 

I cannot follow you, my love, 
you cannot follow me. 
I am the distance you put between 
all of the moments that we will be. 

You know who I am...

"Lady Midnight"

I came by myself to a very crowded place 
I was looking for someone who had lines in her face. 
I found her there but she was past all concern 
I asked her to hold me, I said, "Lady, unfold me," 
but she scorned me and she told me 
I was dead and I could never return. 
Well, I argued all night like so many have before, 
saying, "Whatever you give me, I seem to need so much more." 
Then she pointed at me where I kneeled on her floor, 
she said, "Don't try to use me or slyly refuse me, 
just win me or lose me, 
it is this that the darkness is for." 

I cried, "Oh, Lady Midnight, I fear that you grow old, 
the stars eat your body and the wind makes you cold." 
"If we cry now," she said, "it will just be ignored." 
So I walked through the morning, sweet early morning, 
I could hear my lady calling, 
"You've won me, you've won me, my lord, 
you've won me, you've won me, my lord, 
yes, you've won me, you've won me, my lord, 
ah, you've won me, you've won me, my lord, 
ah, you've won me, you've won me, my lord."

"Tonight Will Be Fine"

Sometimes I find I get to thinking of the past. 
We swore to each other then that our love would surely last. 
You kept right on loving, I went on a fast, 
now I am too thin and your love is too vast. 
But I know from your eyes 
and I know from your smile 
that tonight will be fine, 
will be fine, will be fine, will be fine 
for a while. 

I choose the rooms that I live in with care, 
the windows are small and the walls almost bare, 
there's only one bed and there's only one prayer 
I listen all night for your step on the stair. 

But I know from your eyes 
and I know from your smile 
that tonight will be fine, 
will be fine, will be fine, will be fine 
for a while. 

Oh sometimes I see her undressing for me, 
she's the soft naked lady love meant her to be 
and she's moving her body so brave and so free. 
If I've got to remember that's a fine memory. 

And I know from her eyes 
and I know from her smile 
that tonight will be fine, 
will be fine, will be fine, will be fine 
for a while.

"Avalanche"

Well I stepped into an avalanche, 
it covered up my soul 
when I am not this hunchback that you see, 
I sleep beneath the golden hill. 
You who wish to conquer pain, 
you must learn, learn to serve me well. 
You strike my side by accident 
as you go down for your gold. 
The cripple here that you clothe and feed 
is neither starved nor cold 
he does not ask for your company, 
not at the centre, the centre of the world. 

When I am on a pedestal, 
you did not raise me there. 
Your laws do not compel me 
to kneel grotesque and bare. 
I myself am the pedestal 
for this ugly hump at which you stare. 

You who wish to conquer pain, 
you must learn what makes me kind 
the crumbs of love that you offer me, 
they're the crumbs I've left behind. 
Your pain is no credential here, 
it's just the shadow, shadow of my wound. 

I have begun to long for you, 
I who have no greed 
I have begun to ask for you, 
I who have no need. 
You say you've gone away from me, 
but I can feel you when you breathe. 

Do not dress in those rags for me, 
I know you are not poor 
you don't love me quite so fiercely now 
when you know that you are not sure, 
it is your turn, beloved, 
it is your flesh that I wear.

"Last Year's Man"

The rain falls down on last year's man
That's a Jew's harp on the table
That's a crayon in his hand
And the corners of the blueprint are ruined since they rolled
Far past the stems of thumbtacks
That still throw shadows on the wood
And the skylight is like skin for a drum I'll never mend
And all the rain falls down amen
On the works of last year's man
I met a lady, she was playing with her soldiers in the dark
Oh one by one she had to tell them
That her name was Joan of Arc
I was in that army, yes I stayed a little while
I want to thank you, Joan of Arc
For treating me so well
And though I wear a uniform I was not born to fight
All these wounded boys you lie beside
Goodnight, my friends, goodnight

I came upon a wedding that old families had contrived
Bethlehem the bridegroom
Babylon the bride
Great Babylon was naked, oh she stood there trembling for me
And Bethlehem inflamed us both
Like the shy one at some orgy
And when we fell together all our flesh was like a veil
That I had to draw aside to see
The serpent eat its tail

Some women wait for Jesus, and some women wait for Cain
So I hang upon my altar
And I hoist my axe again
And I take the one who finds me back to where it all began
When Jesus was the honeymoon
And Cain was just the man
And we read from pleasant Bibles that are bound in blood and skin
That the wilderness is gathering
All its children back again

The rain falls down on last year's man
An hour has gone by
And he has not moved his hand
But everything will happen if he only gives the word
The lovers will rise up
And the mountains touch the ground
But the skylight is like skin for a drum I'll never mend
And all the rain falls down amen
On the works of last year's man

"Dress Rehearsal Rag"

Four o'clock in the afternoon 
and I didn't feel like very much. 
I said to myself, "Where are you golden boy, 
where is your famous golden touch" 
I thought you knew where 
all of the elephants lie down, 
I thought you were the crown prince 
of all the wheels in Ivory Town. 
Just take a look at your body now, 
there's nothing much to save 
and a bitter voice in the mirror cries, 
"Hey, Prince, you need a shave." 
Now if you can manage to get 
your trembling fingers to behave, 
why don't you try unwrapping 
a stainless steel razor blade 
That's right, it's come to this, 
yes it's come to this, 
and wasn't it a long way down, 
wasn't it a strange way down 
There's no hot water 
and the cold is running thin. 
Well, what do you expect from 
the kind of places you've been living in 
Don't drink from that cup, 
it's all caked and cracked along the rim. 
That's not the electric light, my friend, 
that is your vision growing dim. 
Cover up your face with soap, there, 
now you're Santa Claus. 
And you've got a gift for anyone 
who will give you his applause. 
I thought you were a racing man, 
ah, but you couldn't take the pace. 
That's a funeral in the mirror 
and it's stopping at your face. 
That's right, it's come to this, 
yes it's come to this, 
and wasn't it a long way down, 
ah wasn't it a strange way down 

Once there was a path 
and a girl with chestnut hair, 
and you passed the summers 
picking all of the berries that grew there 
there were times she was a woman, 
oh, there were times she was just a child, 
and you held her in the shadows 
where the raspberries grow wild. 
And you climbed the twilight mountains 
and you sang about the view, 
and everywhere that you wandered 
love seemed to go along with you. 
That's a hard one to remember, 
yes it makes you clench your fist. 
And then the veins stand out like highways, 
all along your wrist. 
And yes it's come to this, 
it's come to this, 
and wasn't it a long way down, 
wasn't it a strange way down 

You can still find a job, 
go out and talk to a friend. 
On the back of every magazine 
there are those coupons you can send. 
Why don't you join the Rosicrucians, 
they can give you back your hope, 
you can find your love with diagrams 
on a plain brown envelope. 
But you've used up all your coupons 
except the one that seems 
to be written on your wrist 
along with several thousand dreams. 
Now Santa Claus comes forward, 
that's a razor in his mit 
and he puts on his dark glasses 
and he shows you where to hit 
and then the cameras pan, 
the stand in stunt man, 
dress rehearsal rag, 
it's just the dress rehearsal rag, 
you know this dress rehearsal rag, 
it's just a dress rehearsal rag.

"Diamonds In The Mine"

The woman in blue, she's asking for revenge, 
the man in white -- that's you -- says he has no friends. 
The river is swollen up with rusty cans 
and the trees are burning in your promised land. 
And there are no letters in the mailbox, 
and there are no grapes upon the vine, 
and there are no chocolates in the boxes anymore, 
and there are no diamonds in the mine. 

Well, you tell me that your lover has a broken limb, 
you say you're kind of restless now and it's on account of him. 
Well, I saw the man in question, it was just the other night, 
he was eating up a lady where the lions and Christians fight. 

And there are no letters in the mailbox 
and there are no grapes upon the vine, 
and there are no chocolates in the boxes anymore, 
and there are no diamonds in the mine. 

(You tell them now) 

Ah, there is no comfort in the covens of the witch, 
some very clever doctor went and sterilized the bitch, 
and the only man of energy, yes the revolution's pride, 
he trained a hundred women just to kill an unborn child. 

And there are no letters in the mailbox, 
oh no, there are no, no grapes upon your vine, 
and there are, there are no chocolates in your boxes anymore, 
and there are no diamonds in your mine. 
And there are no letters in the mailbox, 
and there are no grapes upon the vine, 
and there are no chocolates in your boxes anymore, 
and there are no diamonds in your mine.

"Love Calls You By Your Name"

You thought that it could never happen 
to all the people that you became, 
your body lost in legend, the beast so very tame. 
But here, right here, 
between the birthmark and the stain, 
between the ocean and your open vein, 
between the snowman and the rain, 
once again, once again, 
love calls you by your name. 
The women in your scrapbook 
whom you still praise and blame, 
you say they chained you to your fingernails 
and you climb the halls of fame. 
Oh but here, right here, 
between the peanuts and the cage, 
between the darkness and the stage, 
between the hour and the age, 
once again, once again, 
love calls you by your name. 

Shouldering your loneliness 
like a gun that you will not learn to aim, 
you stumble into this movie house, 
then you climb, you climb into the frame. 
Yes, and here, right here 
between the moonlight and the lane, 
between the tunnel and the train, 
between the victim and his stain, 
once again, once again, 
love calls you by your name. 

I leave the lady meditating 
on the very love which I, I do not wish to claim, 
I journey down the hundred steps, 
but the street is still the very same. 
And here, right here, 
between the dancer and his cane, 
between the sailboat and the drain, 
between the newsreel and your tiny pain, 
once again, once again, 
love calls you by your name. 

Where are you, Judy, where are you, Anne 
Where are the paths your heroes came 
Wondering out loud as the bandage pulls away, 
was I, was I only limping, was I really lame 
Oh here, come over here, 
between the windmill and the grain, 
between the sundial and the chain, 
between the traitor and her pain, 
once again, once again, 
love calls you by your name.

"Famous Blue Raincoat"

It's four in the morning, the end of December 
I'm writing you now just to see if you're better 
New York is cold, but I like where I'm living 
There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening. 
I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert 
You're living for nothing now, I hope you're keeping some kind of record. 

Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair 
She said that you gave it to her 
That night that you planned to go clear 
Did you ever go clear 

Ah, the last time we saw you you looked so much older 
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder 
You'd been to the station to meet every train 
And you came home without Lili Marlene 

And you treated my woman to a flake of your life 
And when she came back she was nobody's wife. 

Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth 
One more thin gypsy thief 
Well I see Jane's awake -- 

She sends her regards. 

And what can I tell you my brother, my killer 
What can I possibly say 
I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you 
I'm glad you stood in my way. 

If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me 
Your enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free. 

Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes 
I thought it was there for good so I never tried. 

And Jane came by with a lock of your hair 
She said that you gave it to her 
That night that you planned to go clear -- 

Sincerely, L. Cohen

"Sing Another Song, Boys"

(Let's sing another song, boys, this one has grown old and bitter.) 
Ah his fingernails, I see they're broken, 
his ships they're all on fire. 
The moneylender's lovely little daughter 
ah, she's eaten, she's eaten with desire. 
She spies him through the glasses 
from the pawnshops of her wicked father. 
She hails him with a microphone 
that some poor singer, just like me, had to leave her. 
She tempts him with a clarinet, 
she waves a Nazi dagger. 
She finds him lying in a heap 
she wants to be his woman. 
He says, "Yes, I might go to sleep 
but kindly leave, leave the future, 
leave it open." 

He stands where it is steep, 
oh I guess he thinks that he's the very first one, 
his hand upon his leather belt now 
like it was the wheel of some big ocean liner. 
And she will learn to touch herself so well 
as all the sails burn down like paper. 
And he has lit the chain 
of his famous cigarillo. 
Ah, they'll never, they'll never ever reach the moon, 
at least not the one that we're after 
it's floating broken on the open sea, look out there, my friends, 
and it carries no survivors. 
But lets leave these lovers wondering 
why they cannot have each other, 
and let's sing another song, boys, 
this one has grown old and bitter.

"Joan Of Arc"

Now the flames they followed Joan of Arc 
as she came riding through the dark 
no moon to keep her armour bright, 
no man to get her through this very smoky night. 
She said, "I'm tired of the war, 
I want the kind of work I had before, 
a wedding dress or something white 
to wear upon my swollen appetite." 
Well, I'm glad to hear you talk this way, 
you know I've watched you riding every day 
and something in me yearns to win 
such a cold and lonesome heroine. 
"And who are you" she sternly spoke 
to the one beneath the smoke. 
"Why, I'm fire," he replied, 
"And I love your solitude, I love your pride." 

"Then fire, make your body cold, 
I'm going to give you mine to hold," 
saying this she climbed inside 
to be his one, to be his only bride. 
And deep into his fiery heart 
he took the dust of Joan of Arc, 
and high above the wedding guests 
he hung the ashes of her wedding dress. 

It was deep into his fiery heart 
he took the dust of Joan of Arc, 
and then she clearly understood 
if he was fire, oh then she must be wood. 
I saw her wince, I saw her cry, 
I saw the glory in her eye. 
Myself I long for love and light, 
but must it come so cruel, and oh so bright

"Is This What You Wanted"

You were the promise at dawn, 
I was the morning after. 
You were Jesus Christ my Lord, 
I was the money lender. 
You were the sensitive woman, 
I was the very reverend Freud. 
You were the manual orgasm, 
I was the dirty little boy. 
And is this what you wanted 
to live in a house that is haunted 
by the ghost of you and me 

Is this what you wanted ... 

You were Marlon Brando, 
I was Steve McQueen. 
You were K.Y. Jelly, 
I was Vaseline. 
You were the father of modern medicine, 
I was Mr. Clean. 
You where the whore and the beast of Babylon, 
I was Rin Tin Tin. 

And is this what you wanted ... 

And is this what you wanted ... 

You got old and wrinkled, 
I stayed seventeen. 
You lusted after so many, 
I lay here with one. 
You defied your solitude, 
I came through alone. 
You said you could never love me, 
I undid your gown. 

And is this what you wanted ... 

And is this what you wanted ... 

I mean is this what you wanted ... 

That's right, is this what you wanted ...

"Chelsea Hotel 2"

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel, 
you were talking so brave and so sweet, 
giving me head on the unmade bed, 
while the limousines wait in the street. 
Those were the reasons and that was New York, 
we were running for the money and the flesh. 
And that was called love for the workers in song 
probably still is for those of them left. 
Ah but you got away, didn't you babe, 
you just turned your back on the crowd, 
you got away, I never once heard you say, 
I need you, I don't need you, 
I need you, I don't need you 
and all of that jiving around. 

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel 
you were famous, your heart was a legend. 
You told me again you preferred handsome men 
but for me you would make an exception. 
And clenching your fist for the ones like us 
who are oppressed by the figures of beauty, 
you fixed yourself, you said, "Well never mind, 
we are ugly but we have the music." 

And then you got away, didn't you babe... 

I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best, 
I can't keep track of each fallen robin. 
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel, 
that's all, I don't even think of you that often.

"Lover Lover Lover"

I asked my father, 
I said, "Father change my name." 
The one I'm using now it's covered up 
with fear and filth and cowardice and shame. 
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me, 
yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. 

He said, "I locked you in this body, 
I meant it as a kind of trial. 
You can use it for a weapon, 
or to make some woman smile." 

Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me 
yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. 

"Then let me start again," I cried, 
"please let me start again, 
I want a face that's fair this time, 
I want a spirit that is calm." 

Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me 
yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. 

"I never never turned aside," he said, 
"I never walked away. 
It was you who built the temple, 
it was you who covered up my face." 

Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me 
yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. 

And may the spirit of this song, 
may it rise up pure and free. 
May it be a shield for you, 
a shield against the enemy. 

Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me 
yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. 

Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me 
yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me.

"Field Commander Cohen"

Field Commander Cohen, he was our most important spy. 
Wounded in the line of duty, 
parachuting acid into diplomatic cocktail parties, 
urging Fidel Castro to abandon fields and castles. 
Leave it all and like a man, 
come back to nothing special, 
such as waiting rooms and ticket lines, 
silver bullet suicides, 
and messianic ocean tides, 
and racial roller-coaster rides 
and other forms of boredom advertised as poetry. 
I know you need your sleep now, 
I know your life's been hard. 
But many men are falling, 
where you promised to stand guard. 

I never asked but I heard you cast your lot along with the poor. 
But then I overheard your prayer, 
that you be this and nothing more 
than just some grateful faithful woman's favourite singing millionaire, 
the patron Saint of envy and the grocer of despair, 
working for the Yankee Dollar. 

I know you need your sleep now ... 

Ah, lover come and lie with me, if my lover is who you are, 
and be your sweetest self awhile until I ask for more, my child. 
Then let the other selves be wrong, yeah, let them manifest and come 
till every taste is on the tongue, 
till love is pierced and love is hung, 
and every kind of freedom done, then oh, 
oh my love, oh my love, oh my love, 
oh my love, oh my love, oh my love.

"Why Don't You Try"

Why don't you try to do without him 
Why don't you try to live alone 
Do you really need his hands for your passion 
Do you really need his heart for your throne 
Do you need his labour for your baby 
Do you need his beast for the bone 
Do you need to hold a leash to be a lady 
I know you're going to make, make it on your own. 
Why don't your try to forget him 
Just open up your dainty little hand. 
You know this life is filled with many sweet companions, 
many satisfying one-night stands. 
Do you want to be the ditch around a tower 
Do you want to be the moonlight in his cave 
Do you want to give your blessing to his power 
as he goes whistling past his daddy, past his daddy's grave. 

I'd like to take you take you to the ceremony, 
well, that is if I remember the way. 
You see Jack and Jill they're going to join their misery, 
I'm afraid it's time for everyone to pray. 
You can see they've finally taken cover, 
they're willing, yeah they're willing to obey. 
Their vows are difficult, they're for each other, 
so let nobody put a loophole, a loophole in their way.

"There Is A War"

There is a war between the rich and poor, 
a war between the man and the woman. 
There is a war between the ones who say there is a war 
and the ones who say there isn't. 
Why don't you come on back to the war, that's right, get in it, 
why don't you come on back to the war, it's just beginning. 

Well I live here with a woman and a child, 
the situation makes me kind of nervous. 
Yes, I rise up from her arms, she says "I guess you call this love" 
I call it service. 

Why don't you come on back to the war, don't be a tourist, 
why don't you come on back to the war, before it hurts us, 
why don't you come on back to the war, let's all get nervous. 

You cannot stand what I've become, 
you much prefer the gentleman I was before. 
I was so easy to defeat, I was so easy to control, 
I didn't even know there was a war. 

Why don't you come on back to the war, don't be embarrassed, 
why don't you come on back to the war, you can still get married. 

There is a war between the rich and poor, 
a war between the man and the woman. 
There is a war between the left and right, 
a war between the black and white, 
a war between the odd and the even. 

Why don't you come on back to the war, pick up your tiny burden, 
why don't you come on back to the war, let's all get even, 
why don't you come on back to the war, can't you hear me speaking

"A Singer Must Die"

Now the courtroom is quiet, but who will confess. 
Is it true you betrayed us The answer is Yes. 
Then read me the list of the crimes that are mine, 
I will ask for the mercy that you love to decline. 
And all the ladies go moist, and the judge has no choice, 
a singer must die for the lie in his voice. 
And I thank you, I thank you for doing your duty, 
you keepers of truth, you guardians of beauty. 
Your vision is right, my vision is wrong, 
I'm sorry for smudging the air with my song. 

Oh, the night it is thick, my defences are hid 
in the clothes of a woman I would like to forgive, 
in the rings of her silk, in the hinge of her thighs, 
where I have to go begging in beauty's disguise. 
Oh goodnight, goodnight, my night after night, 
my night after night, after night, after night, after night, after night. 

I am so afraid that I listen to you, 
your sun glassed protectors they do that to you. 
It's their ways to detain, their ways to disgrace, 
their knee in your balls and their fist in your face. 
Yes and long live the state by whoever it's made, 
sir, I didn't see nothing, I was just getting home late.

"I Tried To Leave You"

I tried to leave you, I don't deny 
I closed the book on us, at least a hundred times. 
I'd wake up every morning by your side. 
The years go by, you lose your pride. 
The baby's crying, so you do not go outside, 
and all your work it's right before your eyes. 

Goodnight, my darling, I hope you're satisfied, 
the bed is kind of narrow, but my arms are open wide. 
And here's a man still working for your smile.

"Who By Fire"

And who by fire, who by water, 
who in the sunshine, who in the night time, 
who by high ordeal, who by common trial, 
who in your merry merry month of may, 
who by very slow decay, 
and who shall I say is calling 
And who in her lonely slip, who by barbiturate, 
who in these realms of love, who by something blunt, 
and who by avalanche, who by powder, 
who for his greed, who for his hunger, 
and who shall I say is calling 

And who by brave assent, who by accident, 
who in solitude, who in this mirror, 
who by his lady's command, who by his own hand, 
who in mortal chains, who in power, 
and who shall I say is calling

"Take This Longing"

Many men have loved the bells 
you fastened to the rein, 
and everyone who wanted you 
they found what they will always want again. 
Your beauty lost to you yourself 
just as it was lost to them. 
Oh take this longing from my tongue, 
whatever useless things these hands have done. 
Let me see your beauty broken down 
like you would do for one you love. 

Your body like a searchlight 
my poverty revealed, 
I would like to try your charity 
until you cry, "Now you must try my greed." 
And everything depends upon 
how near you sleep to me 

Just take this longing from my tongue 
all the lonely things my hands have done. 
Let me see your beauty broken down 
like you would do for one your love. 

Hungry as an archway 
through which the troops have passed, 
I stand in ruins behind you, 
with your winter clothes, your broken sandal straps. 
I love to see you naked over there 
especially from the back. 

Oh take this longing from my tongue, 
all the useless things my hands have done, 
untie for me your hired blue gown, 
like you would do for one that you love. 

You're faithful to the better man, 
I'm afraid that he left. 
So let me judge your love affair 
in this very room where I have sentenced 
mine to death. 
I'll even wear these old laurel leaves 
that he's shaken from his head. 

Just take this longing from my tongue, 
all the useless things my hands have done, 
let me see your beauty broken down, 
like you would do for one you love. 

Like you would do for one you love.

"Leaving Green Sleeves"

Alas, my love, you did me wrong, 
to cast me out discourteously, 
for I have loved you so long, 
delighting in your very company. 
Now if you intend to show me disdain, 
don't you know it all the more enraptures me, 
for even so I still remain your lover in captivity. 
Green sleeves, you're all alone, 
the leaves have fallen, the men have gone. 
Green sleeves, there's no one home, 
not even the Lady Green Sleeves 

I sang my songs, I told my lies, 
to lie between your matchless thighs. 
And ain't it fine, ain't it wild 
to finally end our exercise 
Then I saw you naked in the early dawn, 
oh, I hoped you would be someone new. 
I reached for you but you were gone, 
so lady I'm going too. 

Green sleeves, you're all alone ... 

Green sleeves, you're all alone, 
the leaves have fallen, the men have all gone home. 
Green sleeves, it's so easily done, 
leaving the Lady Green Sleeves.

"True Love Leaves No Traces"

As the mist leaves no scar 
On the dark green hill 
So my body leaves no scar 
On you and never will 
Through windows in the dark 
The children come, the children go 
Like arrows with no targets 
Like shackles made of snow 

True love leaves no traces 
If you and I are one 
It's lost in our embraces 
Like stars against the sun 

As a falling leaf may rest 
A moment on the air 
So your head upon my breast 
So my hand upon your hair 

And many nights endure 
Without a moon or star 
So we will endure 
When one is gone and far 

True love leaves no traces 
If you and I are one 
It's lost in our embraces 
Like stars against the sun

"Iodine"

I needed you, I knew I was in danger
Of losing what I used to think was mine
You let me love you till I was a failure
You let me love you till I was a failure
Your beauty on my bruise like iodine

I asked you if a man could be forgiven
And though I failed at love, was this a crime
You said, "Don't worry, don't worry, darling,"
You said, "Don't worry, don't you worry, darling
There are many ways a man can serve his time"

You covered up that place I could not master
It wasn't dark enough to shut my eyes
So I was with you, oh sweet compassion
Yes I was with you, oh sweet compassion
Compassion with the sting of iodine

Your saintly kisses reeked of iodine
Your fragrance with a fume of iodine
And pity in the room like iodine

My masquerade of trust was iodine
And everywhere the flare of iodine
Yes it started with the flare of iodine

"Paper Thin Hotel"

The walls of this hotel are paper-thin 
Last night I heard you making love to him 
The struggle mouth to mouth and limb to limb 
The grunt of unity when he came in 
I stood there with my ear against the wall 
I was not seized by jealousy at all 
In fact a burden lifted from my soul 
I heard that love was out of my control 
A heavy burden lifted from my soul 
I heard that love was out of my control 

I listened to your kisses at the door 
I never heard the world so clear before 
You ran your bath and you began to sing 
I felt so good I couldn't feel a thing 

I stood there with my ear against the wall ... 

And I can't wait to tell you to your face 
And I can't wait for you to take my place 
You are The Naked Angel In My Heart 
You are The Woman With Her Legs Apart 
It's written on the walls of this hotel 
You go to heaven once you've been to hell 

A heavy burden lifted from my soul 
I heard that love was out of my control

"Memories"

Frankie Laine, he was singing Jezebel
I pinned an Iron Cross to my lapel
I walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl
I said, "Look, you don't know me now but very soon you will
So won't you let me see"
I said "won't you let me see"
I said "won't you let me see
Your naked body"

"Just dance me to the dark side of the gym
Chances are I will let you do most anything
I know you're hungry, I can hear it in your voice
And there are many parts of me to touch, you have your choice
Ah but no you cannot see
She said "No you cannot see"
She said "No you cannot see
My naked body"

So we're dancing close, the band is playing Stardust
The balloons and paper streamers they're floating down on us
She says, "You've got a minute left to fall in love"
In solemn moments such as this I have put my trust
And all my faith to see
I said all my faith to see
I said all my faith to see
Her naked body
Naked body

All my faith...

(...you cheated you lied)

"I Left A Woman Waiting"

I left a woman waiting 
I met her sometime later 
She said, I see your eyes are dead 
What happened to you, lover 
What happened to you, my lover 
What happened to you, lover 
What happened to you 
And since she spoke the truth to me 
I tried to answer truthfully 
Whatever happened to my eyes 
Happened to your beauty 
Happened to your beauty 
What happened to your beauty 
Happened to me 

We took ourselves to someone's bed 
And there we fell together 
Quick as dogs and truly dead were we 
And free as running water 
Free as running water 
Free as running water 
Free as you and me 
The way it's got to be 
The way it's got to be, lover

"Don't Go Home With Your Hard-On"

I was born in a beauty salon 
My father was a dresser of hair 
My mother was a girl you could call on 
When you called she was always there 
When you called she was always there 
When you called she was always there 
When you called she was always there 
When you called she was always there 

Ah but don't go home with your hard-on 
It will only drive you insane 
You can't shake it (or break it) with your Motown 
You can't melt it down in the rain 

You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 

I've looked behind all of the faces 
That smile you down to you knees 
And the lips that say, Come on, taste us 
And when you try to they make you say Please 

When you try to they make you say Please 
When you try to they make you say Please 
When you try to they make you say Please 
When you try to they make you say Please 

Ah but don't go home with your hard-on ... 

Here come's your bride with her veil on 
Approach her, you wretch, if you dare 
Approach her, you ape with your tail on 
Once you have her she'll always be there 

Once you have her she'll always be there 
Once you have her she'll always be there 
Once you have her she'll always be there 
Once you have her she'll always be there 

Ah but don't go home with your hard-on ... 

So I work in that same beauty salon 
I'm chained to the old masquerade 
The lipstick, the shadow, the silicone 
I follow my father's trade 

I follow my father's trade 
Yes I follow my father's trade 
Yes I follow my father's trade 
Yes I follow my father's trade 

Ah but don't go home with your hard-on 
It will only drive you insane 
You can't shake it (or break it) with your Motown 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain

"Fingerprints"

I touched you once too often 
Now I don't know who I am 
My fingerprints were missing 
When I wiped away the jam 
Yes I called my fingerprints all night 
But they don't seem to care 
The last time that I saw them 
They were leafing through your hair 

Fingerprints, fingerprints 
Where are you now my fingerprints 

Yeah I thought I'd leave this morning 
So I emptied out your drawer 
A hundred thousand fingerprints 
They floated to the floor 

You know you hardly stopped to pick them up 
You don't care what you lose 
Ah you don't even seem to know 
Whose fingerprints are whose 

Fingerprints, fingerprints 
Where are you now my fingerprints 

And now you want to marry me 
You want to take me down the aisle 
You want to throw confetti fingerprints 
You know that's not my style 

O sure I'd like to marry you 
But I can't face the dawn 
With any girl who knew me 
When my fingerprints were on 

Fingerprints, fingerprints 
Where are you now my fingerprints 

Fingerprints, oh fingerprints 
Where are you now my fingerprints

"Death Of A Ladies' Man"

Ah the man she wanted all her life was hanging by a thread 
"I never even knew how much I wanted you," she said. 
His muscles they were numbered and his style was obsolete. 
"O baby, I have come too late." She knelt beside his feet. 
"I'll never see a face like yours in years of men to come 
I'll never see such arms again in wrestling or in love." 
And all his virtues burning in the smoky Holocaust 
She took unto herself most everything her lover lost 
Now the master of this landscape he was standing at the view 
with a sparrow of St. Francis that he was preaching to 
She beckoned to the sentry of his high religious mood 
She said, "I'll make a place between my legs, 
I'll show you solitude." 

He offered her an orgy in a many mirrored room 
He promised her protection for the issue of her womb 
She moved her body hard against a sharpened metal spoon 
She stopped the bloody rituals of passage to the moon 

She took his much admired oriental frame of mind 
and the heart-of-darkness alibi his money hides behind 
She took his blonde madonna and his monastery wine -- 
"This mental space is occupied and everything is mine." 

He tried to make a final stand beside the railway track 
She said, "The art of longing's over and it's never coming back." 
She took his tavern parliament, his cap, his cocky dance, 
she mocked his female fashions and his working-class moustache. 

The last time that I saw him he was trying hard to get 
a woman's education but he's not a woman yet 
And the last time that I saw her she was living with some boy 
who gives her soul an empty room and gives her body joy. 

So the great affair is over but whoever would have guessed 
it would leave us all so vacant and so deeply unimpressed 
It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star 
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far. 

It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star 
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far. 

It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star 
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far.

"The Guests"

One by one, the guests arrive 
The guests are coming through 
The open-hearted many 
The broken-hearted few 
And no one knows where the night is going 
And no one knows why the wine is flowing 
Oh love I need you 
I need you 
I need you 
I need you 
Oh . . . I need you now 

And those who dance, begin to dance 
Those who weep begin 
And "Welcome, welcome" cries a voice 
"Let all my guests come in." 

And no one knows where the night is going ... 

And all go stumbling through that house 
in lonely secrecy 
Saying "Do reveal yourself" 
or "Why has thou forsaken me" 

And no one knows where the night is going ... 

All at once the torches flare 
The inner door flies open 
One by one they enter there 
In every style of passion 

And no one knows where the night is going ... 

And here they take their sweet repast 
While house and grounds dissolve 
And one by one the guests are cast 
Beyond the garden wall 

And no one knows where the night is going ... 

Those who dance, begin to dance 
Those who weep begin 
Those who earnestly are lost 
Are lost and lost again 

And no one knows where the night is going ... 

One by the guests arrive 
The guests are coming through 
The broken-hearted many 
The open-hearted few 

And no one knows where the night is going ...

"Humbled In Love"

Do you remember all of those pledges 
That we pledged in the passionate night 
Ah they're soiled now, they're torn at the edges 
Like moths on a still yellow light 
No penance serves to renew them 
No massive transfusions of trust 
Why not even revenge can undo them 
So twisted these vows and so crushed 
And you say you've been humbled in love 
Cut down in your love 
Forced to kneel in the mud next to me 
Ah but why so bitterly turn from the one 
Who kneels there as deeply as thee 

Children have takes these pledges 
They have ferried them out of the past 
Oh beyond all the graves and the hedges 
Where love must go hiding at last 
And here where there is no description 
Oh here in the moment at hand 
No sinner need rise up forgiven 
No victim need limp to the stand 

And you say you've been humbled in love... 

And look dear heart, look at the virgin 
Look how she welcomes him into her gown 
Yes, and mark how the stranger's cold armour 
Dissolves like a star falling down 
Why trade this vision for desire 
When you may have them both 
You will never see a man this naked 
I will never hold a woman this close 

And you say you've been humbled in love...

"The Window"

Why do you stand by the window 
Abandoned to beauty and pride 
The thorn of the night in your bosom 
The spear of the age in your side 
Lost in the rages of fragrance 
Lost in the rags of remorse 
Lost in the waves of a sickness 
That loosens the high silver nerves 
Oh chosen love, Oh frozen love 
Oh tangle of matter and ghost 
Oh darling of angels, demons and saints 
And the whole broken-hearted host 
Gentle this soul 

And come forth from the cloud of unknowing 
And kiss the cheek of the moon 
The New Jerusalem glowing 
Why tarry all night in the ruin 
And leave no word of discomfort 
And leave no observer to mourn 
But climb on your tears and be silent 
Like a rose on its ladder of thorns 

Oh chosen love, Oh frozen love... 

Then lay your rose on the fire 
The fire give up to the sun 
The sun give over to splendour 
In the arms of the high holy one 
For the holy one dreams of a letter 
Dreams of a letter's death 
Oh bless thee continuous stutter 
Of the word being made into flesh 

Oh chosen love, Oh frozen love... 

Gentle this soul

"Came So Far For Beauty"

I came so far for beauty
I left so much behind
My patience and my family
My masterpiece unsigned

I thought I'd be rewarded
For such a lonely choice
And surely she would answer
To such a very hopeless voice

I practiced on my sainthood
I gave to one and all
But the rumours of my virtue
They moved her not at all

I changed my style to silver
I changed my clothes to black
And where I would surrender
Ah now I would attack

I stormed the old casino
For the money and the flesh
And I myself decided
What was rotten and what was fresh

And men to do my bidding
And broken bones to teach
The value of my pardon
The shadow of my reach

But no, I could not touch her
With such a heavy hand
Her star beyond my order
Her nakedness unmanned

I came so far for beauty
I left so much behind
My patience and my family
My masterpiece unsigned

"The Traitor"

Now the Swan it floated on the English river 
Ah the Rose of High Romance it opened wide 
A sun tanned woman yearned me through the summer 
and the judges watched us from the other side 
I told my mother "Mother I must leave you 
preserve my room but do not shed a tear 
Should rumour of a shabby ending reach you 
it was half my fault and half the atmosphere" 

But the Rose I sickened with a scarlet fever 
and the Swan I tempted with a sense of shame 
She said at last I was her finest lover 
and if she withered I would be to blame 

The judges said you missed it by a fraction 
rise up and brace your troops for the attack 
Ah the dreamers ride against the men of action 
Oh see the men of action falling back 

But I lingered on her thighs a fatal moment 
I kissed her lips as though I thirsted still 
My falsity had stung me like a hornet 
The poison sank and it paralysed my will 

I could not move to warn all the younger soldiers 
that they had been deserted from above 
So on battlefields from here to Barcelona 
I'm listed with the enemies of love 

And long ago she said "I must be leaving, 
Ah but keep my body here to lie upon 
You can move it up and down and when I'm sleeping 
Run some wire through that Rose and wind the Swan" 

So daily I renew my idle duty 
I touch her here and there -- I know my place 
I kiss her open mouth and I praise her beauty 
and people call me traitor to my face

"Our Lady Of Solitude"

All summer long she touched me 
She gathered in my soul 
From many a thorn, from many thickets 
Her fingers, like a weaver's 
Quick and cool 
And the light came from her body 
And the night went through her grace 
All summer long she touched me 
And I knew her, I knew her 
Face to face 

And her dress was blue and silver 
And her words were few and small 
She is the vessel of the whole wide world 
Mistress, oh mistress, of us all 

Dearly dead Queen of Solitude 
I thank you with my heart 
for keeping me so close to thee 
while so many, oh so many, stood apart 

And the light came from her body 
And the night went through her grace 
All summer long she touched me 
I knew her, I knew her 
Face to face

"The Gypsy's Wife"

And where, where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight
I've heard all the wild reports, they can't be right
But whose head is this she's dancing with on the threshing floor
Whose darkness deepens in her arms a little more
And where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight
Where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight

Ah the silver knives are flashing in the tired old cafe
A ghost climbs on the table in a bridal negligee
She says, "My body is the light, my body is the way"
I raise my arm against it all and I catch the bride's bouquet

And where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight
Where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight

Too early for the rainbow, too early for the dove
These are the final days, this is the darkness, this is the flood
And there is no man or woman can be touched
But you who come between them will be judged

And where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight
Where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight

"The Smokey Life"

I've never seen your eyes so wide 
I've never seen your appetite quite this occupied 
Elsewhere is your feast of love 
I know ... where long ago we agreed to keep it light 
So lets be married one more night 
It's light, light enough 
To let it go 
It's light enough to let it go 

Remember when the scenery started fading 
I held you til you learned to walk on air 
So don't look down the ground is gone, 
there's no one waiting anyway 
The Smoky Life is practiced 
Everywhere 

So set your restless heart at ease 
Take a lesson from these Autumn leaves 
They waste no time waiting for the snow 
Don't argue now you'll be late 
There is nothing to investigate 

It's light enough, light enough 
To let it go 
Light enough to let it go 

Remember when the scenery started fading 
I held you til you learned to walk on air 
So don't look down the ground is gone, 
there's no one waiting anyway 
The Smoky Life is practiced everywhere 

Come on back if the moment lends 
You can look up all my very closest friends 

Light, light enough 
To let it go 
It's light enough to let it go

"Ballad Of The Absent Mare"

Say a prayer for the cowboy 
His mare's run away 
And he'll walk til he finds her 
His darling, his stray 
but the river's in flood 
and the roads are awash 
and the bridges break up 
in the panic of loss. 
And there's nothing to follow 
There's nowhere to go 
She's gone like the summer 
gone like the snow 
And the crickets are breaking 
his heart with their song 
as the day caves in 
and the night is all wrong 

Did he dream, was it she 
who went galloping past 
and bent down the fern 
broke open the grass 
and printed the mud with 
the iron and the gold 
that he nailed to her feet 
when he was the lord 

And although she goes grazing 
a minute away 
he tracks her all night 
he tracks her all day 
Oh blind to her presence 
except to compare 
his injury here 
with her punishment there 

Then at home on a branch 
in the highest tree 
a songbird sings out 
so suddenly 
Ah the sun is warm 
and the soft winds ride 
on the willow trees 
by the river side 

Oh the world is sweet 
the world is wide 
and she's there where 
the light and the darkness divide 
and the steam's coming off her 
she's huge and she's shy 
and she steps on the moon 
when she paws at the sky 

And she comes to his hand 
but she's not really tame 
She longs to be lost 
he longs for the same 
and she'll bolt and she'll plunge 
through the first open pass 
to roll and to feed 
in the sweet mountain grass 

Or she'll make a break 
for the high plateau 
where there's nothing above 
and there's nothing below 
and it's time for the burden 
it's time for the whip 
Will she walk through the flame 
Can he shoot from the hip 

So he binds himself 
to the galloping mare 
and she binds herself 
to the rider there 
and there is no space 
but there's left and right 
and there is no time 
but there's day and night 

And he leans on her neck 
and he whispers low 
"Whither thou goest 
I will go" 
And they turn as one 
and they head for the plain 
No need for the whip 
Ah, no need for the rein 

Now the clasp of this union 
who fastens it tight 
Who snaps it asunder 
the very next night 
Some say the rider 
Some say the mare 
Or that love's like the smoke 
beyond all repair 

But my darling says 
"Leonard, just let it go by 
That old silhouette 
on the great western sky" 
So I pick out a tune 
and they move right along 
and they're gone like the smoke 
and they're gone like this song

"Dance Me To The End Of Love"

Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin 
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in 
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove 
Dance me to the end of love 
Dance me to the end of love 
Oh let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone 
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon 
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of 
Dance me to the end of love 
Dance me to the end of love 

Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on 
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long 
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above 
Dance me to the end of love 
Dance me to the end of love 

Dance me to the children who are asking to be born 
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn 
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn 
Dance me to the end of love 

Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin 
Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in 
Touch me with your naked hand, touch me with your glove
Dance me to the end of love 
Dance me to the end of love 
Dance me to the end of love

"Coming Back To You"

Maybe I'm still hurting 
I can't turn the other cheek 
But you know that I still love you 
It's just that I can't speak 
I looked for you in everyone 
And they called me on that too 
I lived alone but I was only 
Coming back to you 
Ah they're shutting down the factory now 
Just when all the bills are due 
And the fields they're under lock and key 
Tho' the rain and the sun come through 
And springtime starts but then it stops 
In the name of something new 
And all the senses rise against this 
Coming back to you 

And they're handing down my sentence now 
And I know what I must do 
Another mile of silence while I'm 
Coming back to you 

There are many in your life 
And many still to be 
Since you are a shining light 
There's many that you'll see 
But I have to deal with envy 
When you choose the precious few 
Who've left their pride on the other side of 
Coming back to you 

Even in your arms I know 
I'll never get it right 
Even when you bend to give me 
Comfort in the night 
I've got to have your word on this 
Or none of it is true 
And all I've said was just instead of 
Coming back to you

"The Law"

How many times did you call me 
And I knew it was late 
I left everybody 
But I never went straight 
I don't claim to be guilty 
But I do understand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 
Now my heart's like a blister 
From doing what I do 
If the moon has a sister 
It's got to be you 
I'm going to miss you forever 
Tho' it's not what I planned 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 

Now the deal has been dirty 
Since dirty began 
I'm not asking for mercy 
Not from the man 
You just don't ask for mercy 
While you're still on the stand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 

I don't claim to be guilty 
Guilty's too grand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 

That's all I can say, baby 
That's all I can say 
It wasn't for nothing 
That they put me away 
I fell with my angel 
Down the chain of command 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand

"The Night Comes On"

I went down to the place 
Where I knew she lay waiting 
Under the marble and the snow 
I said, Mother I'm frightened 
The thunder and the lightning 
I'll never come through this alone 
She said, I'll be with you 
My shawl wrapped around you 
My hand on your head when you go 
And the night came on 
It was very calm 
I wanted the night to go on and on 
But she said, Go back, Go back to the World 

We were fighting in Egypt 
When they signed this agreement 
That nobody else had to die 
There was this terrible sound 
My father went down 
With a terrible wound in his side 
He said, Try to go on 
Take my books, take my gun 
Remember, my son, how they lied 
And the night comes on 
It's very calm 
I'd like to pretend that my father was wrong 
But you don't want to lie, not to the young 

We were locked in this kitchen 
I took to religion 
And I wondered how long she would stay 
I needed so much 
To have nothing to touch 
I've always been greedy that way 
But my son and my daughter 
Climbed out of the water 
Crying, Papa, you promised to play 
And they lead me away 
To the great surprise 
It's Papa, don't peek, Papa, cover your eyes 
And they hide, they hide in the World 

Now I look for her always 
I'm lost in this calling 
I'm tied to the threads of some prayer 
Saying, When will she summon me 
When will she come to me 
What must I do to prepare 
When she bends to my longing 
Like a willow, like a fountain 
She stands in the luminous air 
And the night comes on 
And it's very calm 
I lie in her arms she says, When I'm gone
I'll be yours, yours for a song 

Now the crickets are singing 
The vesper bells ringing 
The cat's curled asleep in his chair 
I'll go down to Bill's Bar 
I can make it that far 
And I'll see if my friends are still there 
Yes, and here's to the few 
Who forgive what you do 
And the fewer who don't even care 
And the night comes on 
It's very calm 
I want to cross over, I want to go home 
But she says, Go back, go back to the World

"Hallelujah"

Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I didwell, reallywhat's it to you
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah

"The Captain"

Now the Captain called me to his bed 
He fumbled for my hand 
"Take these silver bars," he said 
"I'm giving you command." 
"Command of what, there's no one here 
There's only you and me -- 
All the rest are dead or in retreat 
Or with the enemy." 
"Complain, complain, that's all you've done 
Ever since we lost 
If it's not the Crucifixion 
Then it's the Holocaust." 
"May Christ have mercy on your soul 
For making such a joke 
Amid these hearts that burn like coal 
And the flesh that rose like smoke." 

"I know that you have suffered, lad, 
But suffer this awhile 
Whatever makes a soldier sad 
Will make a killer smile." 
"I'm leaving, Captain, I've got to go 
There's blood upon your hand 
But tell me, Captain, if you know 
Of a decent place to stand." 

"There is no decent place to stand 
In a massacre 
But if a woman take your hand 
Then go and stand with her." 
"I left a wife in Tennessee 
And a baby in Saigon -- 
I risked my life, but not to hear 
Some country-western song." 

"Ah but if you cannot raise your love 
To a very high degree, 
Then you're just the man I've been thinking of -- 
So come and stand with me." 
"Your standing days are done," I cried, 
"You'll rally me no more. 
I don't even know what side 
We fought on, or what for." 

"I'm on the side that's always lost 
Against the side of Heaven 
I'm on the side of Snake-eyes tossed 
Against the side of Seven. 
And I've read the Bill of Human Rights 
And some of it was true 
But there wasn't any burden left 
So I'm laying it on you." 

Now the Captain he was dying 
But the Captain wasn't hurt 
The silver bars were in my hand 
I pinned them to my shirt.

"Hunter's Lullaby"

Your father's gone a-hunting 
He's deep in the forest so wild 
And he cannot take his wife with him 
He cannot take his child 
Your father's gone a-hunting 
In the quicksand and the clay 
And a woman cannot follow him 
Although she knows the way 

Your father's gone a-hunting 
Through the silver and the glass 
Where only greed can enter 
But spirit, spirit cannot pass 

Your father's gone a-hunting 
For the beast we'll never bind
And he leaves a baby sleeping 
And his blessings all behind 

Your father's gone a-hunting 
And he's lost his lucky charm 
And he's lost the guardian heart 
That keeps the hunter from the harm 

Your father's gone a-hunting 
He asked me to say goodbye 
And he warned me not to stop him 
I wouldn't, I wouldn't even try

"Heart With No Companion"

I greet you from the other side 
Of sorrow and despair 
With a love so vast and shattered 
It will reach you everywhere 
And I sing this for the captain 
Whose ship has not been built 
For the mother in confusion 
Her cradle still unfilled 

For the heart with no companion 
For the soul without a king 
For the prima ballerina 
Who cannot dance to anything 

Through the days of shame that are coming 
Through the nights of wild distress 
Tho' your promise count for nothing 
You must keep it nonetheless 

You must keep it for the captain 
Whose ship has not been built 
For the mother in confusion 
Her cradle still unfilled 

For the heart with no companion ... 

I greet you from the other side ...

"If It Be Your Will"

If it be your will
That I speak no more
And my voice be still
As it was before
I will speak no more
I shall abide until
I am spoken for
If it be your will

If it be your will
That a voice be true
From this broken hill
I will sing to you
From this broken hill
All your praises they shall ring
If it be your will
To let me sing

From this broken hill 
All your praises they shall ring 
If it be your will 
To let me sing 

If it be your will 
If there is a choice 
Let the rivers fill 
Let the hills rejoice 
Let your mercy spill
On all these burning hearts in hell
If it be your will
To make us well

And draw us near
And bind us tight
All your children here
In their rags of light
In our rags of light
All dressed to kill
And end this night
If it be your will
If it be your will

"First We Take Manhattan"

They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom 
For trying to change the system from within 
I'm coming now, I'm coming to reward them 
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin 
I'm guided by a signal in the heavens 
I'm guided by this birthmark on my skin 
I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons 
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin 

I'd really like to live beside you, baby 
I love your body and your spirit and your clothes 
But you see that line there moving through the station 
I told you, I told you, told you, I was one of those 

Ah you loved me as a loser, but now you're worried that I just might win 
You know the way to stop me, but you don't have the discipline 
How many nights I prayed for this, to let my work begin 
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin 

I don't like your fashion business mister 
And I don't like these drugs that keep you thin 
I don't like what happened to my sister 
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin 

I'd really like to live beside you, baby ... 

And I thank you for those items that you sent me 
The monkey and the plywood violin 
I practiced every night, now I'm ready 
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin 

I am guided 

Ah remember me, I used to live for music 
Remember me, I brought your groceries in 
Well it's Father's Day and everybody's wounded 
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

"Ain't No Cure For Love"

I loved you for a long, long time 
I know this love is real 
It don't matter how it all went wrong 
That don't change the way I feel 
And I can't believe that time's 
Gonna heal this wound I'm speaking of 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure for love 
I'm aching for you baby 
I can't pretend I'm not 
I need to see you naked 
In your body and your thought 
I've got you like a habit 
And I'll never get enough 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure for love 

There ain't no cure for love 
There ain't no cure for love 
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky 
The holy books are open wide 
The doctors working day and night 
But they'll never ever find that cure for love 
There ain't no drink no drug 
(Ah tell them, angels) 
There's nothing pure enough to be a cure for love 

I see you in the subway and I see you on the bus 
I see you lying down with me, I see you waking up 
I see your hand, I see your hair 
Your bracelets and your brush 
And I call to you, I call to you 
But I don't call soft enough 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure for love 

I walked into this empty church I had no place else to go 
When the sweetest voice I ever heard, whispered to my soul 
I don't need to be forgiven for loving you so much 
It's written in the scriptures 
It's written there in blood 
I even heard the angels declare it from above 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure for love 

There ain't no cure for love 
There ain't no cure for love 
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky 
The holy books are open wide 
The doctors working day and night 
But they'll never ever find that cure, 
That cure for love

"Everybody Knows"

Everybody knows that the dice are loaded 
Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed 
Everybody knows that the war is over 
Everybody knows the good guys lost 
Everybody knows the fight was fixed 
The poor stay poor, the rich get rich 
That's how it goes 
Everybody knows 
Everybody knows that the boat is leaking 
Everybody knows that the captain lied 
Everybody got this broken feeling 
Like their father or their dog just died 

Everybody talking to their pockets 
Everybody wants a box of chocolates 
And a long stem rose 
Everybody knows 

Everybody knows that you love me baby 
Everybody knows that you really do 
Everybody knows that you've been faithful 
Ah give or take a night or two 
Everybody knows you've been discreet 
But there were so many people you just had to meet 
Without your clothes 
And everybody knows 

Everybody knows, everybody knows 
That's how it goes 
Everybody knows 

Everybody knows, everybody knows 
That's how it goes 
Everybody knows 

And everybody knows that it's now or never 
Everybody knows that it's me or you 
And everybody knows that you live forever 
Ah when you've done a line or two 
Everybody knows the deal is rotten 
Old Black Joe's still pickin' cotton 
For your ribbons and bows 
And everybody knows 

And everybody knows that the Plague is coming 
Everybody knows that it's moving fast 
Everybody knows that the naked man and woman 
Are just a shining artifact of the past 
Everybody knows the scene is dead 
But there's gonna be a meter on your bed 
That will disclose 
What everybody knows 

And everybody knows that you're in trouble 
Everybody knows what you've been through 
From the bloody cross on top of Calvary 
To the beach of Malibu 
Everybody knows it's coming apart 
Take one last look at this Sacred Heart 
Before it blows 
And everybody knows 

Everybody knows, everybody knows 
That's how it goes 
Everybody knows 

Oh everybody knows, everybody knows 
That's how it goes 
Everybody knows 

Everybody knows

"I'm Your Man"

If you want a lover 
I'll do anything you ask me to 
And if you want another kind of love 
I'll wear a mask for you 
If you want a partner 
Take my hand 
Or if you want to strike me down in anger 
Here I stand 
I'm your man 
If you want a boxer 
I will step into the ring for you 
And if you want a doctor 
I'll examine every inch of you 
If you want a driver 
Climb inside 
Or if you want to take me for a ride 
You know you can 
I'm your man 

Ah, the moon's too bright 
The chain's too tight 
The beast won't go to sleep 
I've been running through these promises to you 
That I made and I could not keep 
Ah but a man never got a woman back 
Not by begging on his knees 
Or I'd crawl to you baby 
And I'd fall at your feet 
And I'd howl at your beauty 
Like a dog in heat 
And I'd claw at your heart 
And I'd tear at your sheet 
I'd say please, please 
I'm your man 

And if you've got to sleep 
A moment on the road 
I will steer for you 
And if you want to work the street alone 
I'll disappear for you 
If you want a father for your child 
Or only want to walk with me a while 
Across the sand 
I'm your man 

If you want a lover 
I'll do anything you ask me to 
And if you want another kind of love 
I'll wear a mask for you

"Take This Waltz"

Now in Vienna there's ten pretty women 
There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry 
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows 
There's a tree where the doves go to die 
There's a piece that was torn from the morning 
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws 
Oh I want you, I want you, I want you 
On a chair with a dead magazine 
In the cave at the tip of the lily 
In some hallways where love's never been 
On a bed where the moon has been sweating 
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
Take its broken waist in your hand 

This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz 
With its very own breath of brandy and Death 
Dragging its tail in the sea 

There's a concert hall in Vienna 
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews 
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking 
They've been sentenced to death by the blues 
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture 
With a garland of freshly cut tears 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
Take this waltz it's been dying for years 

There's an attic where children are playing 
Where I've got to lie down with you soon 
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns 
In the mist of some sweet afternoon 
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow 
All your sheep and your lilies of snow 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
With its "I'll never forget you, you know" 

This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz ... 

And I'll dance with you in Vienna 
I'll be wearing a river's disguise 
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder, 
My mouth on the dew of your thighs 
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook, 
With the photographs there, and the moss 
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty 
My cheap violin and my cross 
And you'll carry me down on your dancing 
To the pools that you lift on your wrist 
Oh my love, Oh my love 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
It's yours now. It's all that there is

"Jazz Police"

Can you tell me why the bells are ringing 
Nothing's happened in a million years 
I've been sitting here since Wednesday morning 
Wednesday morning can't believe my ears 
Jazz police are looking through my folders 
Jazz police are talking to my niece 
Jazz police have got their final orders 
Jazzer, drop your axe, it's Jazz police 

Jesus taken serious by the many 
Jesus taken joyous by a few 
Jazz police are paid by J. Paul Getty 
Jazzers paid by J. Paul Getty II 

Jazz police I hear you calling 
Jazz police I feel so blue 
Jazz police I think I'm falling, 
I'm falling for you 

Wild as any freedom loving racist 
I applaud the actions of the chief 
Tell me now oh beautiful and spacious 
Am I in trouble with the Jazz police 

Jazz police are looking through my folders ... 

They will never understand our culture 
They'll never understand the Jazz police 
Jazz police are working for my mother 
Blood is thicker margarine than grease 

Let me be somebody I admire 
Let me be that muscle down the street 
Stick another turtle on the fire 
Guys like me are mad for turtle meat 

Jazz police I hear you calling 
Jazz police I feel so blue 
Jazz police I think I'm falling, 
I'm falling for you

"I Can't Forget"

I stumbled out of bed 
I got ready for the struggle 
I smoked a cigarette 
And I tightened up my gut 
I said this can't be me 
Must be my double 
And I can't forget, I can't forget 
I can't forget but I don't remember what 
I'm burning up the road 
I'm heading down to Phoenix 
I got this old address 
Of someone that I knew 
It was high and fine and free 
Ah, you should have seen us 
And I can't forget, I can't forget 
I can't forget but I don't remember who 

I'll be there today 
With a big bouquet of cactus 
I got this rig that runs on memories 
And I promise, cross my heart, 
They'll never catch us 
But if they do, just tell them it was me 

Yeah I loved you all my life 
And that's how I want to end it 
The summer's almost gone 
The winter's tuning up 
Yeah, the summer's gone 
But a lot goes on forever 
And I can't forget, I can't forget 
I can't forget but I don't remember what

"Tower Of Song"

Well my friends are gone and my hair is grey
I ache in the places where I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
I'm just paying my rent every day
Oh in the Tower of Song

I said to Hank Williams how lonely does it get
Hank Williams hasn't answered yet
But I hear him coughing all night long
A hundred floors above me
In the Tower of Song

I was born like this, I had no choice
I was born with the gift of a golden voice
And twenty-seven angels from the Great Beyond
They tied me to this table right here
In the Tower of Song

So you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll
I'm very sorry, baby, doesn't look like me at all
I'm standing by the window where the light is strong
Ah they don't let a woman kill you
Not in the Tower of Song

Now you can say that I've grown bitter but of this you may be sure
The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor
And there's a mighty judgment coming, but I may be wrong
You see, you hear these funny voices
In the Tower of Song

I see you standing on the other side
I don't know how the river got so wide
I loved you baby, way back when
And all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed
But I feel so close to everything that we lost
We'll never, we'll never have to lose it again

Now I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'll be back
They're moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track
But you'll be hearing from me baby, long after I'm gone
I'll be speaking to you sweetly
From a window in the Tower of Song

Yeah my friends are gone and my hair is grey
I ache in the places where I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
I'm just paying my rent every day
Oh in the Tower of Song

"The Future"

Give me back my broken night
My mirrored room, my secret life
It's lonely here
There's no one left to torture
Give me absolute control
Over every living soul
And lie beside me, baby
That's an order
Give me crack and anal sex
Take the only tree that's left
And stuff it up the hole
In your culture
Give me back the Berlin wall
Give me Stalin and St Paul
I've seen the future, brother
It is murder

Things are going to slide, slide in all directions
Won't be nothing
Nothing you can measure anymore
The blizzard, the blizzard of the world
Has crossed the threshold
And it has overturned
The order of the soul
When they said REPENT REPENT
I wonder what they meant
When they said REPENT REPENT
I wonder what they meant
When they said REPENT REPENT
I wonder what they meant

You don't know me from the wind
You never will, you never did
I'm the little Jew
Who wrote the Bible
I've seen the nations rise and fall
I've heard their stories, heard them all
But love's the only engine of survival
Your servant here, he has been told
To say it clear, to say it cold
It's over, it ain't going
Any further
And now the wheels of heaven stop
You feel the devil's riding crop
Get ready for the future
It is murder

Things are going to slide

There'll be the breaking of the ancient
Western code
Your private life will suddenly explode
There'll be phantoms
There'll be fires on the road
And the white man dancing
You'll see your woman
Hanging upside down
Her features covered by her fallen gown
And all the lousy little poets
Coming round
Tryin' to sound like Charlie Manson
And the white man dancin'

Give me back the Berlin wall
Give me Stalin and St Paul
Give me Christ
Or give me Hiroshima
Destroy another fetus now
We don't like children anyhow
I've seen the future, baby
It is murder

Things are going to slide

When they said repent repent

"Waiting For The Miracle"

Baby, I've been waiting, 
I've been waiting night and day. 
I didn't see the time, 
I waited half my life away. 
There were lots of invitations 
and I know you sent me some, 
but I was waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 
I know you really loved me. 
but, you see, my hands were tied. 
I know it must have hurt you, 
it must have hurt your pride 
to have to stand beneath my window 
with your bugle and your drum, 
and me I'm up there waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 

Ah I don't believe you'd like it, 
You wouldn't like it here. 
There ain't no entertainment 
and the judgements are severe. 
The Maestro says it's Mozart 
but it sounds like bubble gum 
when you're waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 

Waiting for the miracle 
There's nothing left to do. 
I haven't been this happy 
since the end of World War II. 

Nothing left to do 
when you know that you've been taken. 
Nothing left to do 
when you're begging for a crumb 
Nothing left to do 
when you've got to go on waiting 
waiting for the miracle to come. 

I dreamed about you, baby. 
It was just the other night. 
Most of you was naked 
Ah but some of you was light. 
The sands of time were falling 
from your fingers and your thumb, 
and you were waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come 

Ah baby, let's get married, 
we've been alone too long. 
Let's be alone together. 
Let's see if we're that strong. 
Yeah let's do something crazy, 
something absolutely wrong 
while we're waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 

Nothing left to do ... 

When you've fallen on the highway 
and you're lying in the rain, 
and they ask you how you're doing 
of course you'll say you can't complain -- 
If you're squeezed for information, 
that's when you've got to play it dumb 
You just say you're out there waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come.

"Be For Real"

Are you back in my life to stay 
Or is it just for today 
Oh that you're gonna need me 
If it's a thrill you're looking for 
Honey, I'm flexible. Oh, yeah. 
Just be for real won't you, Baby 
Be for real oh, Baby 
You see I, I don't want to be hurt by love again 

So you see I'm not naive. 
I just would like to believe 
Ah what you tell me. 
So don't give me the world today 
And tomorrow take it away. 
Don't do that to me, darling. 

Just be for real won't you, Baby 
Be for real won't you, Baby 

Been hurt so many times 
You see I, I don't want to be hurt by love again. 

(I don't give a damn about the truth, Baby 
Except for the naked truth. Oh yeah) 

Just be for real won't you, Baby 
Be for real won't you, Baby 

No, no, no, no 
It's just that I, I don't want to be hurt by love again. 

Thanks for the song Mr. Knight.

"Closing Time"

Ah we're drinking and we're dancing 
and the band is really happening 
and the Johnny Walker wisdom running high 
And my very sweet companion 
she's the Angel of Compassion 
she's rubbing half the world against her thigh 
And every drinker every dancer 
lifts a happy face to thank her 
the fiddler fiddles something so sublime 
all the women tear their blouses off 
and the men they dance on the polka-dots 
and it's partner found, it's partner lost 
and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops 
it's CLOSING TIME 
Yeah the women tear their blouses off 
and the men they dance on the polka-dots 
and it's partner found, it's partner lost 
and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops 
it's CLOSING TIME 

Ah we're lonely, we're romantic 
and the cider's laced with acid 
and the Holy Spirit's crying, "Where's the beef" 
And the moon is swimming naked 
and the summer night is fragrant 
with a mighty expectation of relief 
So we struggle and we stagger 
down the snakes and up the ladder 
to the tower where the blessed hours chime 
and I swear it happened just like this 
a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss 
the Gates of Love they budged an inch 
I can't say much has happened since 
but CLOSING TIME 

I swear it happened just like this 
a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss 
the Gates of Love they budged an inch 
I can't say much has happened since 
CLOSING TIME 

I loved you for your beauty 
but that doesn't make a fool of me 
you were in it for your beauty too 
and I loved you for your body 
there's a voice that sounds like God to me 
declaring, declaring, declaring that your body's really you 
And I loved you when our love was blessed 
and I love you now there's nothing left 
but sorrow and a sense of overtime 
and I missed you since the place got wrecked 
And I just don't care what happens next 
looks like freedom but it feels like death 
it's something in between, I guess 
it's CLOSING TIME 

Yeah I missed you since the place got wrecked 
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex 
looks like freedom but it feels like death 
it's something in between, I guess 
it's CLOSING TIME 

Yeah we're drinking and we're dancing 
but there's nothing really happening 
and the place is dead as Heaven on a Saturday night 
And my very close companion 
gets me fumbling gets me laughing 
she's a hundred but she's wearing 
something tight 
and I lift my glass to the Awful Truth 
which you can't reveal to the Ears of Youth 
except to say it isn't worth a dime 
And the whole damn place goes crazy twice 
and it's once for the devil and once for Christ 
but the Boss don't like these dizzy heights 
we're busted in the blinding lights, 
busted in the blinding lights 
of CLOSING TIME 

The whole damn place goes crazy twice 
and it's once for the devil and once for Christ 
but the Boss don't like these dizzy heights 
we're busted in the blinding lights, 
busted in the blinding lights 
of CLOSING TIME 

Oh the women tear their blouses off 
and the men they dance on the polka-dots 
It's CLOSING TIME 
And it's partner found, it's partner lost 
and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops 
It's CLOSING TIME 
I swear it happened just like this 
a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss 
It's CLOSING TIME 
The Gates of Love they budged an inch 
I can't say much has happened since 
But CLOSING TIME 
I loved you when our love was blessed 
I love you now there's nothing left 
But CLOSING TIME 
I miss you since the place got wrecked 
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex.

"Anthem"

The birds they sang 
At the break of day 
Start again 
I heard them say 
Don't dwell on what 
Has passed away 
Or what is yet to be. 
Ah the wars they will 
Be fought again 
The holy dove 
She will be caught again 
Bought and sold 
And bought again 
The dove is never free. 

Ring the bells that still can ring 
Forget your perfect offering 
There is a crack a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in. 

We asked for signs 
The signs were sent 
The birth betrayed 
The marriage spent 
Yeah the widowhood 
Of every government
Signs for all to see. 

I can run no more 
With that lawless crowd 
While the killers in high places 
Say their prayers out loud. 
But they've summoned, they've summoned up 
A thundercloud 
They're gonna hear from me. 

Ring ring ring ring ring 

Ring the bells that still can ring 
Forget your perfect offering 
There is a crack a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in 

You can add up the parts 
But you won't have the sum 
You can strike up the march, 
There is no drum 
Every heart, every heart 
To love will come 
But like a refugee. 

Ring the bells that still can ring 
Forget your perfect offering 
There is a crack, a crack in everything 
That's how the light gets in. 

Ring the bells that still can ring 
Forget your perfect offering 
There is a crack, a crack in everything 
That's how the light gets in. 
That's how the light gets in. 
That's how the light gets in.

"Democracy"

It's coming through a hole in the air, 
from those nights in Tiananmen Square. 
It's coming from the feel 
that this ain't exactly real, 
or it's real, but it ain't exactly there. 
From the wars against disorder, 
from the sirens night and day, 
from the fires of the homeless, 
from the ashes of the gay 
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 
It's coming through a crack in the wall 
on a visionary flood of alcohol 
from the staggering account 
of the Sermon on the Mount 
which I don't pretend to understand at all. 
It's coming from the silence 
on the dock of the bay, 
from the brave, the bold, the battered 
heart of Chevrolet 
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 

It's coming from the sorrow in the street, 
the holy places where the races meet 
from the homicidal bitchin' 
that goes down in every kitchen 
to determine who will serve and who will eat. 
From the wells of disappointment 
where the women kneel to pray 
for the grace of God in the desert here 
and the desert far away 
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 

Sail on, sail on 
O mighty Ship of State 
To the Shores of Need 
Past the Reefs of Greed 
Through the Squalls of Hate 
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on. 

It's coming to America first, 
the cradle of the best and of the worst. 
It's here they got the range 
and the machinery for change 
and it's here they got the spiritual thirst. 
It's here the family's broken 
and it's here the lonely say 
that the heart has got to open 
in a fundamental way 
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 

It's coming from the women and the men. 
O baby, we'll be making love again. 
We'll be going down so deep 
the river's going to weep, 
and the mountain's going to shout Amen 
It's coming like the tidal flood 
beneath the lunar sway, 
imperial, mysterious, 
in amorous array 
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 

Sail on, sail on ... 

I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean 
I love the country but I can't stand the scene. 
And I'm neither left or right 
I'm just staying home tonight, 
getting lost in that hopeless little screen. 
But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags 
that Time cannot decay, 
I'm junk but I'm still holding up 
this little wild bouquet 
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.

"Light As The Breeze"

She stands before you naked 
you can see it, you can taste it, 
and she comes to you light as the breeze. 
Now you can drink it or you can nurse it, 
it don't matter how you worship 
as long as you're 
down on your knees. 
So I knelt there at the delta, 
at the alpha and the omega, 
at the cradle of the river and the seas. 
And like a blessing come from heaven 
for something like a second 
I was healed and my heart 
was at ease. 

O baby I waited 
so long for your kiss 
for something to happen, 
oh something like this. 

And you're weak and you're harmless 
and you're sleeping in your harness 
and the wind going wild 
in the trees, 
and it ain't exactly prison 
but you'll never be forgiven 
for whatever you've done 
with the keys. 

O baby I waited ... 

It's dark now and it's snowing 
O my love I must be going, 
The river has started to freeze. 
And I'm sick of pretending 
I'm broken from bending 
I've lived too long on my knees. 

Then she dances so graceful 
and your heart's hard and hateful 
and she's naked 
but that's just a tease. 
And you turn in disgust 
from your hatred and from your love 
and comes to you 
light as the breeze. 

O baby I waited ... 

There's blood on every bracelet 
you can see it, you can taste it, 
and it's Please baby 
please baby please. 
And she says, Drink deeply, pilgrim 
but don't forget there's still a woman 
beneath this 
resplendent chemise. 

So I knelt there at the delta, 
at the alpha and the omega, 
I knelt there like one who believes. 
And the blessings come from heaven 
and for something like a second 
I'm cured and my heart 
is at ease

"Always"

(Oh friends, .. don't matter if you're a man or a woman. If you're in love 
with somebody, these are the words that you got to learn to say. Now 
listen carefully. Here it comes...) 
I'll be loving you always 
with a love that's true, always 
When the thing you've planned 
needs my helping hand, 
I will understand, always, always 

Days may not be fair, always 
Yeah but that's when I'll be there, always 
Not for just an hour, 
Not for just a day, 
Not for just a year, but always. 

I said that I'll be loving you, always 
with a love that's true, always. 
When the thing you've planned 
needs my helping hand, 
I will, I will understand, always, always 

(Oh that's pretty ... that's pretty too ... Oh darling) 

The days may not be fair, always 
Yeah but that's when I'll be there, always 
Not for just a second, or a minute, or an hour, 
Not for just a weekend and a shake down in the shower, 
Not for just the summer and the winter going sour, 
But always, always, always 

(Ok if you don't want to quit, let's try it one more time) 

I'll be loving you, always 
with a love that's true, always. 
When the thing you've planned 
needs my helping hand, 
I will understand, I will, I will understand, always, always 

The days may not be fair, always 
(Don't worry, baby) 
That's when I'll be there, always 
Not for just an hour, 
Not for just a day, 
Not for just a year, but always.

"In My Secret Life"

I saw you this morning
You were moving so fast
Can't seem to loosen my grip
On the past
And I miss you so much
There's no one in sight
And we're still making love
In My Secret Life

I smile when I'm angry
I cheat and I lie
I do what I have to do
To get by
But I know what is wrong
And I know what is right
And I'd die for the truth
In My Secret Life

Hold on, hold on, my brother
My sister, hold on tight
I finally got my orders
I'll be marching through the morning
Marching through the night
Moving cross the borders
Of My Secret Life

Looked through the paper
Makes you want to cry
Nobody cares if the people
Live or die
And the dealer wants you thinking
That it's either black or white
Thank God it's not that simple
In My Secret Life

I bite my lip
I buy what I'm told
From the latest hit
To the wisdom of old
But I'm always alone
And my heart is like ice
And it's crowded and cold
In My Secret Life

"A Thousand Kisses Deep"

The ponies run, the girls are young,
The odds are there to beat.
You win a while, and then its done 
Your little winning streak.
And summoned now to deal
With your invincible defeat,
You live your life as if its real,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

Im turning tricks, Im getting fixed,
Im back on Boogie Street.
You lose your grip, and then you slip
Into the Masterpiece.
And maybe I had miles to drive,
And promises to keep
You ditch it all to stay alive,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

And sometimes when the night is slow,
The wretched and the meek,
We gather up our hearts and go,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

Confined to sex, we pressed against
The limits of the sea
I saw there were no oceans left
For scavengers like me.
I made it to the forward deck.
I blessed our remnant fleet 
And then consented to be wrecked,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

Im turning tricks, Im getting fixed,
Im back on Boogie Street.
I guess they wont exchange the gifts
That you were meant to keep.
And quiet is the thought of you,
The file on you complete,
Except what we forgot to do,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

And sometimes when the night is slow,
The wretched and the meek,
We gather up our hearts and go,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

The ponies run, the girls are young, 
The odds are there to beat . . .

"That Don't Make It Junk"

I fought against the bottle,
But I had to do it drunk 
Took my diamond to the pawnshop 
But that dont make it junk.

I know that Im forgiven,
But I dont know how I know
I dont trust my inner feelings 
Inner feelings come and go.

How come you called me here tonight
How come you bother
With my heart at all
You raise me up in grace,
Then you put me in a place,
Where I must fall.

Too late to fix another drink 
The lights are going out 
Ill listen to the darkness sing 
I know what thats about.

I tried to love you my way,
But I couldnt make it hold.
So I closed the Book of Longing
And I do what I am told.

How come you called me here tonight
How come you bother with my heart at all
You raise me up in grace,
Then you put me in a place,
Where I must fall.

I fought against the bottle,
But I had to do it drunk 
Took my diamond to the pawnshop 
But that dont make it junk.

"Here It Is"

Here is your crown
And your seal and rings
And here is your love
For all things.

Here is your cart,
And your cardboard and piss
And here is your love
For all of this.

May everyone live,
And may everyone die.
Hello, my love,
And my love, Goodbye.

Here is your wine,
And your drunken fall
And here is your love.
Your love for it all.

Here is your sickness.
Your bed and your pan
And here is your love
For the woman, the man.

May everyone live,
And may everyone die.
Hello, my love,
And, my love, Goodbye.

And here is the night,
The night has begun
And here is your death
In the heart of your son.

And here is the dawn,
(Until death do us part)
And here is your death,
In your daughters heart.

May everyone live,
And may everyone die.
Hello, my love,
And, my love, Goodbye.

And here you are hurried,
And here you are gone
And here is the love,
That its all built upon.

Here is your cross,
Your nails and your hill
And here is your love,
That lists where it will

May everyone live,
And may everyone die.
Hello, my love,
And my love, Goodbye.

"Love Itself"

The light came through the window,
Straight from the sun above,
And so inside my little room
There plunged the rays of Love.

In streams of light I clearly saw
The dust you seldom see,
Out of which the Nameless makes
A Name for one like me.

Ill try to say a little more
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door 
Then Love Itself
Love Itself was gone.

All busy in the sunlight
The flecks did float and dance,
And I was tumbled up with them
In formless circumstance.

Ill try to say a little more
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door 
Then Love Itself
Love Itself was gone.

Then I came back from where Id been.
My room, it looked the same 
But there was nothing left between
The Nameless and the Name.

All busy in the sunlight
The flecks did float and dance,
And I was tumbled up with them
In formless circumstance.

Ill try to say a little more
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door 
Then Love itself,
Love Itself was gone.
Love Itself was gone.

"By The Rivers Dark"

By the rivers dark
I wandered on.
I lived my life
in Babylon.

And I did forget
My holy song
And I had no strength
In Babylon.

By the rivers dark
Where I could not see
Who was waiting there
Who was hunting me.

And he cut my lip
And he cut my heart.
So I could not drink
From the river dark.

And he covered me,
And I saw within,
My lawless heart
And my wedding ring,

I did not know
And I could not see
Who was waiting there,
Who was hunting me.

By the rivers dark
I panicked on.
I belonged at last
to Babylon.

Then he struck my heart
With a deadly force,
And he said, This heart
It is not yours.

And he gave the wind
My wedding ring
And he circled us
With everything.

By the rivers dark,
In a wounded dawn,
I live my life
In Babylon.

Though I take my song
From a withered limb,
Both song and tree,
They sing for him.

Be the truth unsaid
And the blessing gone,
If I forget
My Babylon.

I did not know 
And I could not see
Who was waiting there,
Who was hunting me.

By the rivers dark, 
Where it all goes on
By the rivers dark
In Babylon.

"Alexandra Leaving"

Suddenly the night has grown colder
The god of love preparing to depart
Alexandra hoisted on his shoulder
They slip between the sentries of the heart

Upheld by the simplicities of pleasure
They gain the light, they formlessly entwine
And radiant beyond your widest measure
They fall among the voices and the wine

Its not a trick, your senses all deceiving
A fitful dream, the morning will exhaust 
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for this to happen
Go firmly to the window. Drink it in
Exquisite music. Alexandra laughing
Your first commitments tangible again

And you who had the honor of her evening
And by that honor had your own restored 
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Alexandra leaving with her lord

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for the occasion
In full command of every plan you wrecked 
Do not choose a cowards explanation
that hides behind the cause and the effect

And you who were bewildered by a meaning
Whose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed 
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

"You Have Loved Enough"

I said Id be your lover.
You laughed at what I said.
I lost my job forever.
I was counted with the dead.

I swept the marble chambers,
But you sent me down below.
You kept me from believing
Until you let me know

That I am not the one who loves 
Its love that seizes me.
When hatred with his package comes,
You forbid delivery.

And when the hunger for your touch 
Rises from the hunger,
You whisper, "You have loved enough,
Now let me be the Lover."

I swept the marble chambers,
But you sent me down below.
You kept me from believing
Until you let me know

That I am not the one who loves 
Its love that chooses me.
When hatred with his package comes,
You forbid delivery.

And when the hunger for your touch
Rises from the hunger . . .

"Boogie Street"

O Crown of Light, O Darkened One,
I never thought wed meet.
You kiss my lips, and then its done
Im back on Boogie Street.

A sip of wine, a cigarette,
And then its time to go.
I tidied up the kitchenette
I tuned the old banjo.
Im wanted at the traffic-jam.
Theyre saving me a seat.
Im what I am, and what I am,
Is back on Boogie Street.

And O my love, I still recall
The pleasures that we knew
The rivers and the waterfall,
Wherein I bathed with you.
Bewildered by your beauty there,
Id kneel to dry your feet.
By such instructions you prepare
A man for Boogie Street.

O Crown of Light, O Darkened One

So come, my friends, be not afraid.
We are so lightly here.
It is in love that we are made
In love we disappear.
Tho all the maps of blood and flesh
Are posted on the door,
Theres no one who has told us yet
What Boogie Street is for.

O Crown of Light, O Darkened One,
I never thought wed meet.
You kiss my lips, and then its done
Im back on Boogie Street.

A sip of wine, a cigarette,
And then its time to go . . .

"The Land Of Plenty"

Dont really know who sent me
To raise my voice and say
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day.

I dont know why I come here,
Knowing as I do,
What you really think of me,
What I really think of you.

For the millions in a prison,
That wealth has set apart 
For the Christ who has not risen,
From the caverns of the heart 

For the innermost decision,
That we cannot but obey -
For whats left of our religion,
I lift my voice and pray
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day.

I know I said Id meet you,
Id meet you at the store,
But I cant buy it, baby.
I cant buy it anymore.

And I dont really know who sent me,
To raise my voice and say
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day.

I dont know why I come here,
knowing as I do,
what you really think of me,
what I really think of you.

For the innermost decision
That we cannot but obey
For whats left of our religion
I lift my voice and pray
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day.

"Go No More A-Roving"

[Dedicated to Irving Layton]

So we'll go no more a-roving
So late into the night,
Though the heart be still as loving,
And the moon be still as bright.
For the sword outwears its sheath,
And the soul outwears the breast,
And the heart must pause to breathe,
And love itself have rest.
Though the night was made for loving,
And the day returns too soon,
Yet we'll go no more a-roving
By the light of the moon.

"Because Of"

Because of a few songs
Wherein I spoke of their mystery,
Women have been
Exceptionally kind
to my old age.
They make a secret place
In their busy lives
And they take me there.
They become naked
In their different ways
and they say,
"Look at me, Leonard
Look at me one last time."
Then they bend over the bed
And cover me up
Like a baby that is shivering.

"The Letters"

You never liked to get
The letters that I sent.
But now you've got the gist
Of what my letters meant.
You're reading them again,
The ones you didn't burn.
You press them to your lips,
My pages of concern.
I said there'd been a flood.
I said there's nothing left.
I hoped that you would come.
I gave you my address.
Your story was so long,
The plot was so intense,
It took you years to cross
The lines of self-defense.
The wounded forms appear
The loss, the full extent
And simple kindness here,
The solitude of strength.
You walk into my room.
You stand there at my desk,
Begin your letter to
The one who's coming next.

"Undertow"

I set out one night
When the tide was low
There were signs in the sky
But I did not know
I'd be caught in the grip
Of the undertow
Ditched on a beach
Where the sea hates to go
With a child in my arms
And a chill in my soul
And my heart the shape
Of a begging bowl

"Morning Glory"

No words this time
No words.
No, there are times when nothing can be done.
Not this time.
Is it censorship
Is it censorship
No, it's evaporation.
No, it's evaporation.
Is this leading somewhere
Yes.
We're going down the lane.
Is this going somewhere
Into the garden.
Into the backyard.
We're walking down the driveway.
Are we moving towards....
We're in the backyard.
...some transcendental moment
It's almost light.
That's right. 
That's it.
Are we moving towards some transcendental moment
That's right.
That's it.
Do you think you'll be able to pull it off
Yes. Do you think you can pull it off
Yes, it might happen.
I'm all ears.
I'm all ears.
Oh the morning glory

"On That Day"

Some people say
It's what we deserve
For sins against g-d
For crimes in the world
I wouldn't know
I'm just holding the fort
Since that day
They wounded New York
Some people say
They hate us of old
Our women unveiled
Our slaves and our gold
I wouldn't know
I'm just holding the fort
But answer me this
I won't take you to court
Did you go crazy
Or did you report
On that day
On that day
They wounded New York

"Villanelle For Our Time"

From bitter searching of the heart,
Quickened with passion and with pain
We rise to play a greater part.
This is the faith from which we start
Men shall know commonwealth again
From bitter searching of the heart.
We loved the easy and the smart,
But now, with keener hand and brain,
We rise to play a greater part.
The lesser loyalties depart,
And neither race nor creed remain
From bitter searching of the heart.
Not steering by the venal chart
That tricked the mass for private gain,
We rise to play a greater part.
Reshaping narrow law and art
Whose symbols are the millions slain,
From bitter searching of the heart
We rise to play a greater part.

"There For You"

When it all went down
And the pain came through
I get it now
I was there for you
Don't ask me how
I know it's true
I get it now
I was there for you
I make my plans
Like I always do
But when I look back
I was there for you
I walk the streets
Like I used to do
And I freeze with fear
But I'm there for you
I see my life
In full review
It was never me
It was always you
You sent me here
You sent me there
Breaking things
I can't repair
Making objects
Out of thoughts
Making more
By thinking not
Eating food
And drinking wine
A body that
I thought was mine
Dressed as Arab
Dressed as Jew
O mask of iron
I was there for you
Moods of glory
Moods so foul
The world comes through
A bloody towel
And death is old
But it's always new
I freeze with fear
And I'm there for you
I see it clear
I always knew
It was never me
I was there for you
I was there for you
My darling one
And by your law
It all was done

"Dear Heather"

Dear Heather
Please walk by me again
With a drink in your hand
And your legs all white
From the winter

"Nightingale"

[Dedicated to Carl Anderson (1945-2004)]

I built my house beside the wood
So I could hear you singing
And it was sweet and it was good
And love was all beginning
Fare thee well my nightingale
'Twas long ago I found you
Now all your songs of beauty fail
The forest closes 'round you
The sun goes down behind a veil
'Tis now that you would call me
So rest in peace my nightingale
Beneath your branch of holly
Fare thee well my nightingale
I lived but to be near you
Tho' you are singing somewhere still
I can no longer hear you

"To A Teacher"

[Dedicated to A. M. Klein (1909-1972)]

Hurt once and for all into silence.
A long pain ending without a song to prove it.
Who could stand beside you so close to Eden,
When you glinted in every eye the held-high
razor, shivering every ram and son
And now the silent loony bin, where
The shadows live in the rafters like
Day-weary bats,
Until the turning mind, a radar signal,
lures them to exaggerate
Mountain-size on the white stone wall
Your tiny limp.
How can I leave you in such a house
Are there no more saints and wizards
to praise their ways with pupils,
No more evil to stun with the slap
of a wet red tongue
Did you confuse the Messiah in a mirror
and rest because he had finally come
Let me cry Help beside you, Teacher.
I have entered under this dark roof
As fearlessly as an honoured son
Enters his father's house.

"The Faith"

[Based on a Quebec folk song]

The sea so deep and blind
The sun, the wild regret
The club, the wheel, the mind,
O love, aren't you tired yet
The club, the wheel, the mind
O love, aren't you tired yet
The blood, the soil, the faith
These words you can't forget
Your vow, your holy place
O love, aren't you tired yet
The blood, the soil, the faith
O love, aren't you tired yet
A cross on every hill
A star, a minaret
So many graves to fill
O love, aren't you tired yet
So many graves to fill
O love, aren't you tired yet
The sea so deep and blind
Where still the sun must set
And time itself unwind
O love, aren't you tired yet
And time itself unwind
O love, aren't you tired yet

"Tennessee Waltz (Live)"

I was dancing with my darlin'
to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
Introduced him to my loved one
and while they were waltzing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me.
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes I lost my little darlin'
The night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz.
She comes dancing through the darkness
To the Tennessee Waltz
And I feel like I'm falling apart
And it's stronger than drink
And it's deeper than sorrow
This darkness she's left in my heart.

"Going Home"

I'd love to speak with Leonard
He's a sportsman and a shepherd
He's a lazy bastard
Living in a suit

But he does say what I tell him
Even though it isn't welcome
He just doesn't have the freedom
To refuse

He will speak these words of wisdom
Like a sage, a man of vision
Though he knows he's really nothing
But the brief elaboration of a tube

Going home without my sorrow
Going home sometime tomorrow
Going home to where it's better
Than before

Going home without my burden
Going home behind the curtain
Going home without this costume
That I wore

He wants to write a love song
An anthem of forgiving
A manual for living
With defeat

A cry above the suffering
A sacrifice recovering
But that isn't what I need him
To complete

I want him to be certain
That he doesn't have a burden
That he doesn't need a vision
That he only has permission
To do my instant bidding which is to
Say what I have told him to repeat

Going home without my sorrow
Going home sometime tomorrow
Going home to where it's better than before

Going home without my burden
Going home behind the curtain
Going home without the costume that I wore

I'm going home without my sorrow
Going home sometime tomorrow
Going home to where it's better than before

Going home without my burden
Going home behind the curtain
Going home without this costume that I wore

I love to speak with Leonard
He's a sportsman and a shepherd
He's a lazy bastard living in a suit

"Amen"

Tell me again
When I've been to the river
And I've taken the edge off my thirst
Tell me again
We're alone and I'm listening
I'm listening so hard that it hurts
Tell me again
When I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again
When I've seen through the horror
Tell me again
Tell me over and over
Tell me that you want me then
Amen...

Tell me again
When the victims are singing
And the Laws of Remorse are restored
Tell me again
That you know what I'm thinking
But vengeance belongs to the Lord
Tell me again
When I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again
When I've seen through the horror
Tell me again
Tell me over and over
Tell me that you love me then
Amen...

Tell me again
When the day has been ransomed
And the night has no right to begin
Try me again
When the angels are panting
And scratching at the door to come in
Tell me again
When I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again
When I've seen through the horror
Tell me again
Tell me over and over
Tell me that you need me then
Amen...

Tell me again
When the filth of the butcher
Is washed in the blood of the lamb
Tell me again
When the rest of the culture
Has passed through the Eye of the Camp
Tell me again
When I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again
When I've seen through the horror
Tell me again
Tell me over and over
Tell me that you love me then
Amen...

"Show Me The Place"

Show me the place where you want your slave to go
Show me the place I've forgotten I don't know
Show me the place where my head is bendin' low
Show me the place where you want your slave to go

Show me the place, help me roll away the stone
Show me the place, I can't move this thing alone
Show me the place where the word became a man
Show me the place where the suffering began

The troubles came I saved what I could save
A thread of light, a particle, a wave
But there were chains, so I hastened to behave
There were chains, so I loved you like a slave

Show me the place where you want your slave to go
Show me the place I've forgotten I don't know
Show me the place where my head is bendin' low
Show me the place where you want your slave to go

The troubles came I saved what I could save
A thread of light, a particle, a wave
But there were chains, so I hastened to behave
There were chains, so I loved you like a slave

Show me the place
Show me the place
Show me the place

Show me the place, help me roll away the stone
Show me the place, I can't move this thing alone
Show me the place where the word became a man
Show me the place where the suffering began

"Darkness"

I caught the darkness
It was drinking from your cup
I caught the darkness
I'm drinking from your cup
I said Is this contagious
You said Just drink it up

I got no future
I know my days are few
The present's not that pleasant
Just a lot of things to do
I thought the past would last me
But the darkness got that too

I should have seen it coming
It was right behind your eyes
You were young and it was summer
I just had to take a dive
Winning you was easy
But darkness was the prize

I don't smoke no cigarette
I don't drink no alcohol
I ain't had much loving yet
But that's always been your call
Hey I don't miss it baby
I got no taste for anything at all

I used to love the rainbow
And I used to love the view
I loved the early morning
I'd pretend that it was new
But I caught the darkness baby
And I got it worse than you

I caught the darkness
It was drinking from your cup
I caught the darkness
I'm drinking from your cup
I said Is this contagious
You said Just drink it up

"Anyhow"

I know it really is a pity
The way you treat me now
I know you cant forgive me
But forgive me anyhow
The ending got so ugly
I even heard you say
You never ever loved me
But could you love me anyway

I dreamed about you baby
You were wearing half your dress
I know you have to hate me
But could you hate me less
I used up all my chances
And youll never take me back
But there aint no harm in asking
Could you cut me one more slack

Im naked and Im filthy
And theres sweat upon my brow
And both of us are guilty
Anyhow
Have mercy on me baby
After all I did confess
Even though you have to hate me
Could you hate me less

Its a shame and its a pity
I know you cant forgive me
The ending got so ugly
You never ever loved me
Dreamed about you baby
I know you have to hate me
Im naked and Im filthy
And both of us are guilty
Anyhow
Have mercy on me baby

"Crazy To Love You"

Had to go crazy to love you
Had to go down to the pit
Had to do time in the tower
Begging my crazy to quit

Had to go crazy to love you
You who were never the one
Whom I chased through the souvenir heartache
Her braids and her blouse all undone

Sometimes Id head for the highway
Im old and the mirrors dont lie
But crazy has places to hide in
That are deeper than any goodbye

Had to go crazy to love you
Had to let everything fall
Had to be people I hated
Had to be no one at all

Im tired of choosing desire
I been saved by a blessed fatigue
The gates of commitment unwired
And nobody trying to leave

Sometimes Id head for the highway
Im old and the mirrors dont lie
But crazy has places to hide in
That are deeper than any goodbye

Had to go crazy to love you
You who were never the one
Whom I chased through the souvenir heartache
Her braids and her blouse all undone

"Come Healing"

O gather up the brokenness
And bring it to me now
The fragrance of those promises
You never dared to vow

The splinters that you carry
The cross you left behind
Come healing of the body
Come healing of the mind

And let the heavens hear it
The penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb

Behold the gates of mercy
In arbitrary space
And none of us deserving
The cruelty or the grace

O solitude of longing
Where love has been confined
Come healing of the body
Come healing of the mind

O see the darkness yielding
That tore the light apart
Come healing of the reason
Come healing of the heart

O troubled dust concealing
An undivided love
The Heart beneath is teaching
To the broken Heart above

O let the heavens falter
And let the earth proclaim
Come healing of the Altar
Come healing of the Name

O longing of the branches
To lift the little bud
O longing of the arteries
To purify the blood

And let the heavens hear it
The penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb

O let the heavens hear it
The penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb

"Banjo"

Theres something that Im watching
Means a lot to me
Its a broken banjo bobbing
On the dark infested sea

Dont know how it got there
Maybe taken by the wave
Off of someones shoulder
Or out of someones grave

Its coming for me darling
No matter where I go
Its duty is to harm me
My duty is to know

Theres something that Im watching
Means a lot to me
Its a broken banjo bobbing
On the dark infested sea

"Lullaby"

Sleep baby sleep
The days on the run
The wind in the trees
Is talking in tongues

If your heart is torn
I dont wonder why
If the night is long
Heres my lullaby
Heres my lullaby

Well the mouse ate the crumb
Then the cat ate the crust
Now theyve fallen in love
Theyre talking in tongues

If your heart is torn
I dont wonder why
If the night is long
Heres my lullaby
Heres my lullaby

Sleep baby sleep
Theres a morning to come
The wind in the trees
Theyre talking in tongues

If your heart is torn
I dont wonder why
If the night is long
Heres my lullaby
Heres my lullaby

"Different Sides"

We find ourselves on different sides
Of a line nobody drew
Though it all may be one in the higher eye
Down here where we live it is two

I to my side call the meek and the mild
You to your side call the Word
By virtue of suffering I claim to have won
You claim to have never been heard

Both of us say there are laws to obey
But frankly I dont like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
I want to leave it alone

The pull of the moon, the thrust of the sun
And thus the ocean is crossed
The waters are blessed while a shadowy guest
Kindles a light for the lost

Both of us say there are laws to obey
But frankly I dont like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
I want to leave it alone

Down in the valley the famine goes on
The famine up on the hill
I say that you shouldnt, you couldnt, you cant
You say that you must and you will

Both of us say there are laws to obey
But frankly I dont like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
I want to leave it alone

You want to live where the suffering is
I want to get out of town
Cmon baby give me a kiss
Stop writing everything down

Both of us say there are laws to obey
Yeah, but frankly I dont like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
I want to leave it alone

Both of us say there are laws to obey
But frankly I dont like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
I want to leave it alone

"Slow"

Im slowing down the tune
I never liked it fast
You want to get there soon
I want to get there last

Its not because Im old
Its not the life I led
I always liked it slow
Thats what my momma said

Im lacing up my shoe
But I dont want to run
Ill get here when I do
Dont need no starting gun

Its not because Im old
Its not what dying does
I always liked it slow
Slow is in my blood

I always liked it slow
I never liked it fast
With you its got to go
With me its got to last

Its not because Im old
Its not because Im dead
I always liked it slow
Thats what my momma said

All your moves are swift
All your turns are tight
Let me catch my breath
I thought we had all night

I like to take my time
I like to linger as it flies
A weekend on your lips
A lifetime in your eyes

I always liked it slow...

Im slowing down the tune
I never liked it fast
You want to get there soon
I want to get there last

So baby let me go
Youre wanted back in town
In case they want to know
Im just trying to slow it down

"Almost Like The Blues"

I saw some people starving
There was murder, there was rape
Their villages were burning
They were trying to escape
I couldn't meet their glances
I was staring at my shoes
It was acid, it was tragic
It was almost like the blues

I have to die a little
Between each murderous thought
And when I'm finished thinking
I have to die a lot
There's torture and there's killing
And there's all my bad reviews
The war, the children missing
Lord, it's almost like the blues

So I let my heart get frozen
To keep away the rot
My father says I'm chosen
My mother says I'm not
I listened to their story
Of the Gypsies and the Jews
It was good, it wasn't boring
It was almost like the blues

There is no God in Heaven
And there is no Hell below
So says the great professor
Of all there is to know
But I've had the invitation
That a sinner can't refuse
And it's almost like salvation
It's almost like the blues

"Samson In New Orleans"

You said that you were with me
You said you were my friend
Did you really love the city
Or did you just pretend

You said you loved her secrets
And her freedoms hid away
She was better than America
Thats what I heard you say

You said how could this happen
You said how can this be
The remnant all dishonored
On the bridge of misery

And we who cried for mercy
From the bottom of the pit
Was our prayer so damn unworthy
The Son rejected it

So gather up the killers
Get everyone in town
Stand me by those pillars
Let me take this temple down

The king so kind and solemn
He wears a bloody crown
So stand me by that column
Let me take this temple down

You said how could this happen
You said how can this be
The chains are gone from heaven
The storms are wild and free

Theres other ways to answer
That certainly is true
Me, Im blind with death and anger
And thats no place for you

Theres a woman in the window
And a bed in Tinsel Town
Ill write you when its over
Let me take this temple down

"A Street"

I used to be your favorite drunk
Good for one more laugh
Then we both ran out of luck
Luck was all we ever had
You put on a uniform
To fight the Civil War
You looked so good I didnt care
What side youre fighting for

It wasnt all that easy
When you up and walked away
But Ill save that little story
For another rainy day
I know the burdens heavy
As you wheel it through the night
Some people say its empty
But that dont mean its light

You left me with the dishes
And a baby in the bath
Youre tight with the militias
You wear their camouflage
You always said were equal
So let me march with you
Just an extra in the sequel
To the old red white and blue

Baby dont ignore me
We were smokers we were friends
Forget that tired story
Of betrayal and revenge
I see the Ghost of Culture
With numbers on his wrist
Salute some new conclusion
Which all of us have missed

I cried for you this morning
And Ill cry for you again
But Im not in charge of sorrow
So please dont ask me when
There may be wine and roses
And magnums of champagne
But well never no well never
Ever be that drunk again

The partys over
But Ive landed on my feet
Ill be standing on this corner
Where there used to be a street

"Did I Ever Love You"

Did I ever love you
Did I ever need you
Did I ever fight you
Did I ever want to

Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
Are we still leaning
Across the old table

Did I ever love you...

Was it ever settled
Was it ever over
And is it still raining
Back in November

The lemon trees blossom
The almond trees wither
Was I ever someone
Who could love you forever

Was it ever settled
Was it ever over
And is it still raining
Back in November

The lemon trees blossom
The almond trees wither
It's Spring and it's Summer
And it's Winter forever

Did I ever love you
Does it really matter
Did I ever fight you
You don't need to answer

Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
Are we still leaning
Across the old table

Did I ever love you...

"My Oh My"

Wasnt hard to love you
Didnt have to try
Wasnt hard to love you
Didnt have to try
Held you for a little while
My Oh My Oh My

Drove you to the station
Never asked you why
Drove you to the station
Never asked you why
Held you for a little while
My Oh My Oh My

All the boys are waving
Trying to catch your eye
All the boys are waving
Trying to catch your eye
Held you for a little while
My Oh My Oh My

Wasnt hard to love you
Didnt have to try
Wasnt hard to love you
Didnt have to try
Held you for a little while
My Oh My Oh My

"Nevermind"

The war was lost
The treaty signed
I was not caught
I crossed the line

I was not caught
Though many tried
I live among you
Well disguised

I had to leave
My life behind
I dug some graves
You'll never find

The story's told
With facts and lies
I had a name
But never mind

Never mind
Never mind
The war was lost
The treaty signed

There's truth that lives
And truth that dies
I don't know which
So never mind

    
   

Your victory
Was so complete
That some among you
Thought to keep

A record of
Our little lives
The clothes we wore
Our spoons our knives

The games of luck
Our soldiers played
The stones we cut
The songs we made

Our law of peace
Which understands
A husband leads
A wife commands

And all of this
Expressions of
The Sweet Indifference
Some call Love

The High Indifference
Some call Fate
But we had Names
More intimate

Names so deep and
Names so true
They're blood to me
They're dust to you

There is no need
That this survive
There's truth that lives
And truth that dies

Never mind
Never mind
I live the life
I left behind

There's truth that lives
And truht that dies
I don't know which
So never mind

    
   

I could not kill
The way you kill
I could not hate
I tried I failed

You turned me in
At least you tried
You side with them
Whom you despise

This was your heart
This swarm of flies
This was once your mouth
This bowl of lies

You serve them well
I'm not surprised
You're of their kin
You're of their kind

Never mind
Never mind
I had to leave
My life behind
The story's told
With facts and lies
You own the world
So never mind

Never mind
Never mind
I live the life
I left behind

I live it full
I live it wide
Through layers of time
You can't divide

My woman's here
My children too
Their graves are safe
From ghosts like you

In places deep
With roots entwined
I live the life I left behind

The war was lost
The treaty signed
I was not caught
I crossed the line

I was not caught
Though many tried
I live among you
Well disguised

"Born In Chains"

[SHARON, HATTIE AND CHARLEY]
I was born...

[LEONARD]
I was born in chains but I was taken out of Egypt
I was bound to a burden, but the burden it was raised
Oh Lord I can no longer keep this secret
Blessed is the name, the name be praised.

[SHARON]
I fled to the edge of the mighty sea of sorrow
Pursued by the riders of a cruel and dark regime
But the waters parted and my soul crossed over
Out of Egypt, out of Pharaohs dream

[LEONARD]
Word of words and the measure of all measures
Blessed is the name, the name be blessed
Written on my heart in burning letters
Thats all I know, I do not know the rest

[HATTIE]
I was idle with my soul, when I heard that you could use me
I followed very closely, but my life remained the same
But then you showed me where you had been wounded
In every atom broken is the Name

[CHARLEY]
I was alone on the road, your love was so confusing
And all my teachers told me that I had myself to blame
But in the grip of sensual illusion
A sweet unknowing unified the name

[LEONARD]
Word of words, and the measure of all measures
Blessed is the name, the name be blessed
Written on my heart in burning letters
Thats all I know, I cannot read the rest

[LEONARD]
I've heard the soul unfolds in the chambers of its longing
And the bitter liquor sweetens in the hammered  cup
Ah but all the ladders of the night have fallen
Just darkness now, to lift the longing up

[LEONARD]
Word of words and measure of all measures
Blessed is the name, the name be blessed
Written on my heart in burning letters
Thats all I know, I cannot read the rest

[SHARON, HATTIE AND CHARLEY]
Just darkness now, to lift the spirit up

"You Got Me Singing"

You got me singing
Even tho' the news is bad
You got me singing
The only song I ever had

You got me singing
Ever since the river died
You got me thinking
Of the places we could hide

You got me singing
Even though the world is gone
You got me thinking
I'd like to carry on

You got me singing
Even tho' it all looks grim
You got me singing
The Hallelujah hymn

You got me singing
Like a prisoner in a jail
You got me singing
Like my pardon's in the mail

You got me wishing
Our little love would last
You got me thinking
Like those people of the past

You got me singing
Even though the world is gone
You got me thinking
I'd like to carry on

You got me singing
Even tho' it all went wrong
You got me singing
The Hallelujah song

"You Want It Darker"

If you are the dealer, I'm out of the game
If you are the healer, it means I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory then mine must be the shame
You want it darker
We kill the flame

Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name
Vilified, crucified, in the human frame
A million candles burning for the help that never came
You want it darker

Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my lord

There's a lover in the story
But the story's still the same
There's a lullaby for suffering
And a paradox to blame
But it's written in the scriptures
And it's not some idle claim
You want it darker
We kill the flame

They're lining up the prisoners
And the guards are taking aim
I struggled with some demons
They were middle class and tame
I didn't know I had permission to murder and to maim
You want it darker

Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my lord

Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name
Vilified, crucified, in the human frame
A million candles burning for the love that never came
You want it darker
We kill the flame

If you are the dealer, let me out of the game
If you are the healer, I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory, mine must be the shame
You want it darker

Hineni, hineni
Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my lord

Hineni
Hineni, hineni
Hineni

"Treaty"

I've seen you change the water into wine
I've seen you change it back to water, too
I sit at your table every night
I try but I just don't get high with you
I wish there was a treaty we could sign
I do not care who takes this bloody hill
I'm angry and I'm tired all the time
I wish there was a treaty, I wish there was a treaty
Between your love and mine

Ah, they're dancing in the street  it's Jubilee
We sold ourselves for love but now we're free
I'm so sorry for that ghost I made you be
Only one of us was real and that was me

I haven't said a word since you been gone
That any liar couldn't say as well
I just can't believe the static coming on
You were my ground, my safe and sound
You were my aerial

Ah, the fields are crying out  it's Jubilee
We sold ourselves for love but now we're free
I'm so sorry for that ghost I made you be
Only one of us was real and that was me

I heard the snake was baffled by his sin
He shed his scales to find the snake within
But born again is born without a skin
The poison enters into everything

And I wish there was a treaty we could sign
I do not care who takes this bloody hill
I'm angry and I'm tired all the time
I wish there was a treaty, I wish there was a treaty
Between your love and mine

"On The Level"

I knew that it was wrong
I didn't have a doubt
I was dying to get back home
And you were starting out

I said I'd best be moving on
You said, we have all day
You smiled at me like I was young
It took my breath away

Your crazy fragrance all around
Your secrets all in view
My lost, my lost was saying found
My don't was saying do

Let's keep it on the level
When I walked away from you
I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too

They oughta give my heart a medal
For letting go of you
When I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too

Now I'm living in this temple
Where they tell you what to do
I'm old and I've had to settle
On a different point of view

I was fighting with temptation
But I didn't want to win
A man like me don't like to see
Temptation caving in

Your crazy fragrance all around
Your secrets in my view
My lost, my lost was saying found
My don't was saying do

Let's keep it on the level
When I walked away from you
I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too

They ought to give my heart a medal
For letting go of you
When I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too

They ought to give my heart a medal
For letting go of you
When I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too

"Leaving The Table"

I'm leaving the table
I'm out of the game
I don't know the people
In your picture frame
If I ever loved you or no, no
It's a crying shame if I ever loved you
If I knew your name

You don't need a lawyer
I'm not making a claim
You don't need to surrender
I'm not taking aim
I don't need a lover, no, no
The wretched beast is tame
I don't need a lover
So blow out the flame

There's nobody missing
There is no reward
Little by little
We're cutting the cord
We're spending the treasure, oh, no, no
That love cannot afford
I know you can feel it
The sweetness restored

I don't need a reason
For what I became
I've got these excuses
They're tired and lame
I don't need a pardon, no, no, no, no, no
There's no one left to blame
I'm leaving the table
I'm out of the game

I'm leaving the table
I'm out of the game

"If I Didn't Have Your Love"

If the sun would lose its light
And we lived an endless night
And there was nothing left that you could feel
That's how it would be
What my life would seem to me
If I didn't have your love to make it real

If the stars were all unpinned
And a cold and bitter wind
Swallowed up the world without a trace
Ah, well that's where I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I couldn't lift the veil and see your face

And if no leaves were on the tree
And no water in the sea
And the break of day had nothing to reveal
That's how broken I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I didn't have your love to make it real

If the sun would lose its light
And we lived in an endless night
And there was nothing left that you could feel
If the sea were sand alone
And the flowers made of stone
And no one that you hurt could ever heal
Well that's how broken I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I didn't have your love to make it real

"Traveling Light"

I'm traveling light
It's au revoir
My once so bright, my fallen star
I'm running late, they'll close the bar
I used to play one mean guitar
I guess I'm just somebody who
Has given up on the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light like we used to do

Good night, good night, my fallen star
I guess you're right, you always are
I know you're right about the blues
You live some life you'd never choose
I'm just a fool, a dreamer who forgot to dream of the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light like we used to do

Traveling light
It's au revoir
My once so bright, my fallen star
I'm running late, they'll close the bar
I used to play one mean guitar
I guess I'm just somebody who
Has given up on the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light like we used to do

But if the road leads back to you
Must I forget the things I knew
When I was friends with one or two
Traveling light like we used to do
I'm traveling light

"It Seemed The Better Way"

It seemed the better way
When first I heard him speak
Now it's much too late
To turn the other cheek

Sounded like the truth
Seemed the better way
Sounded like the truth
But it's not the truth today

I wonder what it was
I wonder what it meant
First he touched on love
Then he touched on death

Sounded like the truth
Seemed the better way
Sounded like the truth
But it's not the truth today

I better hold my tongue
I better take my place
Lift this glass of blood
Try to say the grace

Seemed the better way
When first I heard him speak
But now it's much too late
To turn the other cheek

Sounded like the truth
Seemed the better way
Sounded like the truth
But it's not the truth today

I better hold my tongue
I better take my place
Lift this glass of blood
Try to say the grace

"Steer Your Way"

Steer your way past the ruins of the Altar and the Mall
Steer your way through the fables of Creation and The Fall
Steer your way past the Palaces that rise above the rot
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought

Steer your heart past the Truth that you believed in yesterday
Such as Fundamental Goodness and the Wisdom of the Way
Steer your heart, precious heart, past the women whom you bought
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought

Steer your way through the pain that is far more real than you
That smashed the Cosmic Model, that blinded every view
And please don't make me go there, though there be a God or not
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought

They whisper still, the ancient stones, the blunted mountains weep
As he died to make men holy, let us die to make things cheap
And say the Mea Culpa, which you probably forgot
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought

Steer your way, O my heart, though I have no right to ask
To the one who was never, never equal to the task
Who knows he's been convicted, who knows he will be shot
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought

They whisper still, the ancient stones, the blunted mountains weep
As he died to make men holy, let us die to make things cheap
And say your Mea Culpa, which you gradually forgot
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought

"String Reprise  Treaty"

I wish there was a treaty we could sign
It's over now, the water and the wine
We were broken then but now we're borderline
And I wish there was a treaty, I wish there was a treaty between your love and mine

"Happens To The Heart"

I was always working steady
But I never called it art
I got my shit together
Meeting Christ and reading Marx
It failed my little fire
But it's bright the dying spark
Go tell the young messiah
What happens to the heart

There's a mist of summer kisses
Where I tried to double-park
The rivalry was vicious
The women were in charge
It was nothing, it was business
But it left an ugly mark
I've come here to revisit
What happens to the heart

I was selling holy trinkets
I was dressing kind of sharp
Had a pussy in the kitchen
And a panther in the yard

In the prison of the gifted
I was friendly with the guards
So I never had to witness
What happens to the heart

I should have seen it coming
After all I knew the chart
Just to look at her was trouble
It was trouble from the start
Sure we played a stunning couple
But I never liked the part
It ain't pretty, it ain't subtle
What happens to the heart

Now the angel's got a fiddle
The devil's got a harp
Every soul is like a minnow
Every mind is like a shark
I've broken every window
But the house, the house is dark
I care but very little
What happens to the heart

Then I studied with this beggar
He was filthy, he was scarred
By the claws of many women
He had failed to disregard
No fable here no lesson
No singing meadowlark
Just a filthy beggar guessing
What happens to the heart

I was always working steady
But I never called it art
It was just some old convention
Like the horse before the cart
I had no trouble betting
On the flood, against the ark
You see, I knew about the ending
What happens to the heart

I was handy with a rifle
My father's .303
I fought for something final
Not the right to disagree

"Moving On"

I loved your face I loved your hair
Your t-shirts and your evening-wear
As for the world the job the war
I ditched them all to love you more

And now you're gone, now you're gone
As if there ever was a you
Who broke the heart and made it new
Who's moving on, who's kiddin' who

I loved your moods I love the way
They threaten every single day
Your beauty ruled me though I knew
Twas more hormonal than the view

Now you're gone, now you're gone
As if there ever was a you
Queen of lilac, queen of blue
Who's moving on, who's kiddin' who

I loved your face I loved your hair
Your t-shirts and your evening-wear
As for the world the job the war
I ditched them all to love you more

And now you're gone, now you're gone
As if there ever was a you
Who held me dyin' pulled me through
Who's moving on, who's kiddin' who

Who's moving on, who's kiddin' who

"The Night Of Santiago"

She said she was a maiden
That wasn't what I heard
For the sake of conversation
I took her at her word
The lights went out behind us
The fireflies undressed
The broken sidewalk ended
I touched her sleeping breasts
They opened to me urgently
Likelilies from the dead
Behind a fine embroidery
Her nipples rose like bread
Then I took off my necktie
And she took off her dress
My belt and pistol set aside
We tore away the rest

The night of Santiago
And I was passing through
So I took her to the river
As any man would do

Her thighs they slipped away from me
Like schools of startled fish
Though I've forgotten half my life
I still remember this
Now, as a man I won't repeat
The things she said aloud
Except for this, my lips are sealed forever
And for now
And soon there's sand in every kiss
And soon the dawn is ready
And soon the night surrenders
To a daffodil machete
I gave her something pretty
And I waited till she laughed
I wasn't born a gypsy
To make a woman sad

The night of Santiago
And I was passing through
I took her to the river
As any man would do
The night of Santiago
And I was passing through
I took her to the river
As any man would do

I didn't fall in love of course
It's never up to you
But she was walking back and forth
And I was passing through
When I took her to the river
In her virginal apparel
When I took her to the river
On that night of Santiago
And yes she lied about it all
Her children and her husband
You were born to judge the world
Forgive me but I wasn't

The night of Santiago
And I was passing through
So I took her to the river
As any man would do

The night of Santiago
And I was passing through
So I took her to the river
As any man would do

The night of Santiago
And I was passing through
So I took her to the river
As any man would do

"Thanks For The Dance"

Thanks for the dance
I'm sorry you're tired
The evening has hardly begun

Thanks for the dance
Try to look inspired
One-two-three, one-two-three, one

There is a rose in your hair
Your shoulders are bare
You've been wearing this costume forever
So turn up the music
Pour out the wine
Stop at the surface
The surface is fine
We don't need to go any deeper

Thanks for the dance
I hear that we're married
One-two-three, one-two-three, one
Thanks for the dance
And the baby you carried
It was almost a daughter or a son

And there's nothing to do
But to wonder if you
Are as hopeless as me
And as decent
We're joined in the spirit
Joined at the hip
Joined in the panic
Wondering if
We've come to some sort
Of agreement

It was fine, it was fast
We were first, we were last
In line at the
Temple of Pleasure
But the green was so green
And the blue was so blue
I was so I
And you were so you
The crisis was light
As a feather

Thanks for the dance
It was hell, it was swell, it was fun
Thanks for all the dances
One-two-three, one-two-three, one

"It's Torn"

I see you in windows that open so wide
There's nothing beyond them and no one inside
You kick off your sandals and shake out your hair
The salt on your shoulders like sparks in the air
There's silt on your ankles and sand on your feet
The river too shallow, the ocean too deep
You smile at your suffering, the sweetest reprieve
Why did you leave us, why did you leave

You kick off your sandals and shake out your hair
It's torn where you're dancing, it's torn everywhere
It's torn on the right and it's torn on the left
It's torn in the center which few can accept

It's torn where there's beauty, it's torn where there's death
It's torn where there's mercy but torn somewhat less
It's torn in the highest from kingdom to crown
The messages fly but the network is down
Bruised at the shoulder and cut at the wrist
The sea rushes home to its thimble of mist
The opposites falter, the spirals reverse
And Eve must re-enter the sleep of her birth
And up through the system the worlds are withdrawn
From every dominion the mind stood upon
And now that it's over and now that it's done
The name has no number, not even the one

Come gather the pieces all scattered and lost
The lie in what's holy, the light in what's not
The story's been written the letter's been sealed
You gave me a lily but now it's a field

You kick off your sandals and shake out your hair
It's torn where you're dancing, it's torn everywhere

"The Goal"

I can't leave my house
Or answer the phone
I'm going down again
But I'm not alone

Settling at last
Accounts of the soul
This for the trash
That paid in full

As for the fall, it
Began long ago
Can't stop the rain
Can't stop the snow

I sit in my chair
I look at the street
The neighbor returns
My smile of defeat

I move with the leaves
I shine with the chrome
I'm almost alive
I'm almost at home

No one to follow
And nothing to teach
Except that the goal
Falls short of the reach

"Puppets"

German puppets burned the Jews
Jewish puppets did not choose
Puppet vultures eat the dead
Puppet corpses they are fed
Puppet winds and puppet waves
Puppet sailors in their graves
Puppet flower, puppet stem
Puppet time dismantles them
Puppet me and puppet you
Puppet German
Puppet Jew

Puppet Presidents command
Puppet troops to burn the land
Puppet fire, puppet flames
Feed on all the puppet names
Puppet lovers in their bliss
Turn away from all of this
Puppet reader shakes his head
Takes his puppet wife to bed
Puppet me and puppet you
Puppet German, puppet Jew

Puppet Presidents command
Puppet troops to burn the land
Puppet fire, puppet flames
Feed on all the puppet names
Puppet night comes down to play
The after act to puppet day

"The Hills"

I can't make the hills
The system is shot
I'm living on pills
For which I thank God

My animal howls
My angel's upset
But I'm not allowed
A trace of regret

For someone will use
The thing I could not be
My heart will be hers
Impersonally

She'll step on the path
She'll see what I mean
My will cut in half
And freedom between

For this in a second
Our lives will collide
The endless suspended
The door opened wide

And she will be born
To someone like you
What I left undone
She will certainly do

I know she is coming
And I know she will look
And that is the longing
And this is the hook

I can't make the hills
The system is shot
I'm living on pills
For which I thank God

My page was too white
My ink was too thinned
The day wouldn't write
But the night penciled in

But I know she's coming
And I know she will look
That is the longing
This is the hook

I know she is coming
And I know she will look
That is the longing
And this is the hook

I can't make the hills
The system is shot
I'm living on pills
For which I thank God

I sailed like a swan
I sank like a rock
But time is long gone
Past my laughing stock

I can't make the hills
The system is shot
I'm living on pills
For which I thank God

"Listen To The Hummingbird"

Listen to the hummingbird
Whose wings you cannot see
Listen to the hummingbird
Don't listen to me

Listen to the butterfly
Whose days but number three
Listen to the butterfly
Don't listen to me

Listen to the mind of God
Which doesn't need to be
Listen to the mind of God
Don't listen to me

Listen to the hummingbird
Whose wings you cannot see
Listen to the hummingbird
Don't listen to me

"Feels So Good"

Feels so good, not to love you like I did
Feels so good, not to love you like I did
It's like they tore away my blindfold and they said, we're gonna let this prisoner live
It's like they tore away my blindfold and they said, we're gonna let this prisoner live

Feels so good to wake up in the morning by myself
Cup of coffee in the kitchen, fire up a little danger to my health
Ah, they're selling freedom everywhere, it's flying off the shelf
Yeah, they're selling freedom everywhere but love, that's something else

Ah you drift into my dreams as if you had the right
And you show me how you broke me doing all the little things I really like
But I let it all go by just so long as you and I don't have to fight
Yeah, I let it all go by just so long as you and I don't have to fight

Well I don't know about tomorrow but I know what's coming next
I've used up all my questions I have no answers left
In a while I won't remember what I promised you I never would forget
In a while I won't remember what I promised you I never would forget

Feels so good not to wonder who you'll get
Who you love, who you touch and who you kiss
Oh baby, who'd ever guess that there's a side of loneliness as sweet as this
Would you ever guess that there's a side of loneliness as sweet as this

Feels so good not to love you like I did
Feels so good not to love you like I did
It's like they tore away my blindfold and they said, we're gonna let this prisoner live
It's like they tore away my blindfold and they said, we're gonna let this prisoner live

"Necropsy Of Love"

If it came about you died
It might be said I loved you
Love is an absolute as death is
And neither bears false witness to the other
But you remain alive

No, I do not love you
Hate the word
That private tyranny inside a public sound
Your freedom's yours and not my own
But hold my separate madness like a sword
And plunge it in your body all night long

If death shall strip our bones of all but bones
Then here's the flesh and flesh that's drunken-sweet
As wine cups in deceptive lunar light
Reach up your hand and turn the moonlight off
And maybe it was never there at all
So never promise anything to me
But reach across the darkness with your hand
Reach across the distance of tonight
And touch the moving moment once again
Before you fall asleep

"Never Gave Nobody Trouble"

Couldn't pay the mortgage
And it broke my baby's heart
I couldn't pay the mortgage
It broke my baby's heart
I never gave nobody trouble
But it ain't too late to start

Don't wanna break no window
Don't wanna burn no car
Don't wanna break no window
And I don't wanna burn your car
You got the right to all your riches
But you let it go too far

You sail the mighty ocean
On a yacht designed for you
You sail the mighty ocean
On a yacht designed for you
Yeah, but the ocean's thick with garbage
You ain't gonna make it through

[Solo]

I never gave nobody trouble
I'm a law and order man
I never gave nobody trouble
I'm a law and order man
I said, I never gave nobody trouble
But you know god damn well that I can

"Recitation"

You came to me this morning and you handled me like meat.
Youd have to be a man to know how good that feels, how sweet.
My mirrored twin, my next of kin, Id know you in my sleep and who but you would take me in, a thousand kisses deep.

I loved you when you opened like a lily to the heat, you see Im just another snowman standing in the rain and sleet, who loved you with his frozen love, his second hand physique, with all he is, and all he was,
A thousand kisses deep.

I know you had to lie to me, I know you had to cheat, to pose all hot and high behind the veils of shear deceit, our perfect porn aristocrat so elegant and cheap, Im old but Im still into that,
A thousand kisses deep.

Im good at love, Im good at hate, it' s in between I freeze.
Been working out, but its too late, its been to late for years.
But you look good, you really do, they love you on the street.
If you were here Id kneel for you,
a thousand kisses deep.

The autumn moved across your skin, got something in my eye, a light that doesnt need to live, and doesnt need to die.
A riddle in the book of love, obscure and obsolete, till witnessed here in time and blood,
A thousand kisses deep.

And I'm still working with the wine, still dancing cheek to cheek, the band is playing Auld Lang Syne, but the heart will not retreat.
I ran with Diz and I sang with Ray, I never had their sweep, but once or twice they let me play
A thousand kisses deep.

I loved you when you opened like a lily to the heat, you see, I'm just another snowman standing in the rain and sleet, who loved you with his frozen love, his second hand physique, with all he is, and all he was,
A thousand kisses deep.

But you dont need to hear me now, and every word I speak, it counts against me anyhow,
A thousand kisses deep.

"I Don't Wanna Be Funny Anymore"

I don't wanna be funny anymore
I don't wanna be funny anymore
Lately, I've been feeling like the odd man out
I hurt my friends saying things I don't mean out loud

I don't wanna be funny anymore
I got a too short skirt, maybe I can be the cute one
Is there room in the band I don't need to be the front man
If not, then I'll be the biggest fan

I don't want the joke to be on me
Yeah, I'll buy the clothes and I'll be the best dressed
Yeah, I'll read the books and I'll be the smartest
I'll play guitar and I'll be the artist

Try not to laugh
I know it'll be hard
I'm serious
I know it's a first but

I don't wanna be funny anymore
Yeah, I'll be the gossip, hear it through the grape vine
Pass it on, she's done with the old times
That funny girl doesn't wanna smile for a while

"Troublemaker Doppelganger"

Is that a hearse or a limousine
It's like I've seen it on the TV screen
She had the body of a beauty queen
Put on a pedestal for good hygiene

I saw a girl that looked like you
And I wanted to tell everyone to run away from her
Run away, run away
It couldn't have been you but she had your eyes
Made for faking smiles and turning tides
Hands full of young men wrapped around her finger

They made you a throne out of magazines
They made you a crown out of peonies
She grew up as the pretty young thing
Let them look up her skirt on the backyard swing
Oh no

Daddy told you to stay indoors
And I can understand how a girl gets bored-
Too old to play and too young to mess around
She was a victim of the same disease
That's roaming the streets and bites when it please
And makes us wanna live forever or die in infamy

I wanna live in a world where I can keep my doors wide open
But who knows what'd get in and what'd get out
One of these nights, I'll sleep with the windows down
But not until that creature's in the pound

No child is born knowing there's an ugly or evil thing
When did my folks stop covering my eyes
Was it my brother who taught me about jealousy
Was it my sister who taught me about vanity
Was it that girl, that beautiful girl
Thirsty for love and eager for attention
Was it that girl who taught me about destruction

I wanna live in a world where I can keep my doors wide open
But who knows what'd get in and what'd get out

"Green Eyes, Red Face"

Slow dancing
At low tide, low tide
Drawn to move
By the moon, by the moon

And I see the seat next to yours is unoccupied
And I was wondering if you'd let me come and sit by your side
I've got plenty of affection
I'd be glad to show you some time

Slow motion
In double time, double time
You are all
I can't deny

And I see the seat next to yours is unoccupied
And I was wondering if you'd let me come and sit by your side
I've got plenty of affection
I'd be glad to show you some time

What am I supposed to do
With you in the room
What am I supposed to say
With your green eyes on my red face
With your green eyes on my red face

"Strange Torpedo"

You got yourself a bunch of bad habits
Not hard to see that love is a weakness
Seems to me, the way you understand it
Is that you're never gonna make it happen

I get smoke in my eyes every time I try
To look you in the eye
Do I even know what your face looks like
Or just the cloud of smoke in it's place
I'm trying to tell you something you might've heard before

You got a dollar in your pocket
You got a pebble in your sock and
You've got a mind of gold you keep secret
I gotta hope that one day you'll use it

I get tongue-tied every time I try
To tell you what I think is right
Cause I think it's wrong when you sit around
Looking like a toy in the lost and found
I am telling you something you might've heard before
And forgot on the spot

You're a strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
And I'll play the fool, and I'll play the fool

I see the blood rushing to your head
Your words are slurred and your cheeks are red
You'd do anything to stop pretending
Can't have regrets when you can't remember them

You are one of a kind, I cannot lie
You're wild when your body's in overdrive
And I'm more surprised every time you're alive
When I check for your breath in the morning

You're a strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
And I'll play the fool, and I'll play the fool

I thought you'd hit rock bottom
But I'm starting to think that it doesn't exist
Cause you've been falling for so long
And you haven't hit anything solid yet

I thought you'd hit rock bottom
But I'm starting to think that it doesn't exist
Cause you've been falling for so long
And you haven't hit anything solid yet

You're a strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
And I'll play the fool, and I'll play the fool, and I'll play the fool

"Dream State..."

We woke up to the thunder
We huddled under covers
We didn't say anything
If you hadn't come over
I would be so much colder
I would be much less confused

And then the water came
And washed it all away
It left me with nothing to say
Could not believe my eyes
I could not recognize
Your face in the rubble

Without you, I am surely the last of our kind
Without you, I am surely the last of my kind

We had a lot to measure
We had more past than pleasure
And time grows deep like weeds
You catch me when I'm falling
Sometimes, I wish you wouldn't
I can't tell if I'm learning

And then the water came
And washed it all away
It left me with nothing to say
Could not believe my eyes
I could not recognize
Your face in the rubble

Without you I am surely the last of our kind
Without you I am surely the last of my kind
Without you I am surely the last of our kind
Without you I am surely the last of my kind
Without you I am surely the last of our kind
Without you I am surely the last of my kind

"Trust"

I set a fire on the stove
And fed it every word I wrote
I watched my journals turn to smoke
Now all there is is what I spoke

I decided long ago
To make the most of what I know
And worry not of what I don't
Perfect the art of letting go

Cause if I trust in something else
Then I don't need to trust myself
I've learned a lot since I began
But I think I was wiser then

I've done too much and not enough
In trying to put you above
I cannot tell if I'm in love
Or whose regard I'm thinking of

If beauty is the only way
To make the nightmares go away
I'll plant a garden in your brain
And let the roots absorb the pain

I set a fire to my soul
I hope it ate til it was full
I set a fire to my soul
It burned me and it made me whole

"Map On A Wall"

Oh please, don't make fun of me
Of my crooked smile and my crowded teeth
Of my pigeon feet, of my knobby knees
Well, I got more problems than not

But I feel fine and I made up my mind
To live happily, feeling beautiful beneath the trees
Above a ground that's solid at the core
Oh please, don't make fun of me
Oh you know I get frightened so easily
When I'm all alone and the floorboards creak
It's those noises in the dark

But I am alive and I made up my mind
To live fearlessly, running wild beneath the trees
Above a ground that's solid at the core

Send my regards to the north my friends
I am built for the heat, I regret to admit
My fear of freezing keeps me on my feet
And so far my whole life's one long lucky streak
They say you should take the credit when it comes
But I believe in haunted wood

Oh please, don't make fun of me
Oh I'll try my best to tell it like it is
But I'll bite my tongue and I'll close my lips
When nobody wants to hear it

But here we are and something about it doesn't feel like an accident
We're all looking for something to adore
And how to survive the bending and breaking

I've walked on two legs since I was a child
But when did I realize that some ways out
Past the horizon for thousands of miles
There are people like me, walking on legs like mine

Coming closer and farther away
Coming to me and from my embrace
Hoping good comes from good
And good comes from bad anyway

Oh please, don't make fun of me
With my heart of gold and my restless soul
Oh please, don't make fun of me
This smile happens genuinely

If you want to see the world, you have to say goodbye
Cause a map does no good hanging on a wall
If you want to see the world, you have to say goodbye
Cause a map does no good hanging on a wall

"Direct Address"

You know it's unfair that I am here and you are there
I feel short in the exchange- I show you mine you walk away
I'm wearing mine out on my sleeve, you're wearing yours where I can't see
But I'll remember your face for years to come
And wonder what you thought about when you got home

Honesty is like a kiss on the lips
Come closer and I'll tell you exactly how it is
Now I'm barely breathing, I'm moving ahead
But if I see you smile, it's gonna knock me dead

I'm stiff in my tracks trying to recover
From whatever drug you used to put me under

I don't believe in love at first sight
I don't believe in love at first sight
It's hard enough for me to not fall in love with every person I see

I let my mind get turned inside out
Just to see what the kids were laughing about
It wasn't worth understanding something
I could've gone my whole life not knowing

You know what they say about curiosity
That murderer had his chokehold on me
I ran away without turning back
But every now and then I want what I can't have

I'm still thinking of a man from years ago-
Eyes open wide in the front row
Dark features, leaning on the doorframe
I would've sold my soul to know his first name

I don't believe in love at first sight
I don't believe in love at first sight
I don't believe in love at first sight
Maybe I would if you looked at me right

"...Familiar Place"

I came through the backyard
You let the garden die
How did I get here
How did I get here
What did I do to deserve this

The mountain was taller than I could've fathomed
I hardly believe it from here at the bottom
I can't imagine why you'd want to be at the top
Oh my god, what will I do if you ever stop

Without you, I am surely the last of our kind
Without you, I am surely the last of my kind

"Night Shift"

The first time I tasted somebody else's spit, I had a coughing fit
I mistakenly called them by your name
I was let down it wasn't the same

I'm doing fine, trying to derail my one track mind
Regaining my self-worth in record time
But I can't help but think of your other in the bed that was mine

Am I a masochist, resisting urges to punch you in the teeth, call you a bitch and leave
Why did I come here To sit and watch you stare at your feet
What was the plan Absolve your guilt and shake hands

I feel no need to forgive but I might as well
But let me kiss your lips so I know how it felt
Pay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down
Walk for hours in the dark feeling all hell

Don't hold your breath, forget you ever saw me at my best
You don't deserve what you don't respect
Don't deserve what you say you love and then neglect

Now bite your tongue, it's too dangerous to fall so young
Take back what you said
Can't lose what you never had

I feel no need to forgive but I might as well
But let me kiss your lips so I know how it felt
Pay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down
Walk for hours in the dark feeling all hell

You got a 9 to 5, so I'll take the night shift
And I'll never see you again if I can help it
In five years I hope the songs feel like covers
Dedicated to new lovers

You got a 9 to 5, so I'll take the night shift
And I'll never see you again if I can help it
In five years I hope the songs feel like covers
Dedicated to new lovers

You got a 9 to 5, so I'll take the night shift
And I'll never see you again if I can help it
In five years I hope the songs feel like covers
Dedicated to new lovers

"Addictions"

Freeze frame, tidal wave in the passenger side
I'm still a nervous kid after all this time
Can you imagine what it's like to be here with you now
Forget your current lover, remember me that one July
Lay in bed, black under oaths, watching the planes at night
I knew one day it'd be so hard to have you by my side

Now I'm awake at 2AM
Without a cause to draw you in

Buy low, sell high kind of guy
Invest your time in what's worthwhile
Was I a risk without reward or did I make you proud

Now I'm awake at 2AM
Without a cause to draw you in

I'm just calling 'cause I'm used to it
You pick up 'cause you're not a quitter
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too

You've been around the world and back
Always return to the ones you love
You've got a sense of adventure
An adventure for comfort that keeps you at home

I'm just calling 'cause I'm used to it
You pick up 'cause you're not a quitter
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too

Releasing
Years of senseless waiting
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too

"The Shell"

I'm a ghost
Walking in a boring dream
You are there
Talking and I'm not listening
I am busy doing nothing
And you're rudely interrupting

It's a myth and now I see it clearly
You don't have to be sad to make something worth hearing
Now I'm calm and content
One more burden off my back

You don't wanna be a creator
Doesn't mean you've got nothing to say
Put down the pen, don't let it force your hand

I'm a ghost
Walking on an empty street
No name anymore
No need to call for me
I'm a long-lost hometown hero
Late to legendary past lives within me

If I had the offer to do it again
Make me invincible, invisible, or brain dead
If the body and the life were two things that we could divide
I'd deliver up my shell to be filled with somebody else

You don't wanna be a creator
Doesn't mean you've got nothing to say
Put down the pen, don't let it force your hand

You don't wanna be a leader
Doesn't mean you don't know the way
Hold your own hand, walk on without a plan

"Nonbeliever"

You threw your books into the river
Told your Mom that you're a non-believer
She says she wasn't surprised but that doesn't make it ok

You say nobody loves a city
Nobody loves what can't love 'em back
One-way ticket in your pocket
What happened to the charm of a small town

If you find what you're looking for
Be sure to send a postcard
You promised you'd never forget
The little ones when you got big

You deal an unspoken debt
No kindness without wanting something back
What do I owe you What did I forget
Are we even after all of that

You shook my hand and said goodbye
You'll never let me see you cry again
What good has come from learning to pretend
You said I could've been a better friend

If you find what you're looking for
Be sure to send a new address
And if you find what you're looking for
Write a letter and tell us what it is, and tell us what it is

Everybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out
Everybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out
Everybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out
Everybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out

"Yours & Mine"

I'm afraid of pain
Both yours and mine
Both yours and mine
I'm afraid of pain
From where it comes
And where it falls

Somebody lit the store on fire
Somebody lit the house on fire
Somebody lit the crowd on fire
Marching away and you've got nothing to say
You've got nothing to say
Have you got nothing to say

For those of you who told me I should stay indoors
Take care of you and yours
Take care of you and yours
But me and mine (me and mine)
Me and mine (me and mine)
We've got a long way to go
Before we get home
'Cause this ain't my home anymore
This ain't my home anymore
This ain't my home

Somebody lit the store on fire

Take care of you and yours
Take care of you and yours
But me and mine (me and mine)
Me and mine (me and mine)

This ain't my home anymore

"Body To Flame"

(Huh)
Longing for your short hair to grow back to the way you like
Thank you for the gesture
I regret ever implying that you could be better
Didn't mean to empty your perfect body
And fill it with my passing will

Easily won, weary of losing, gullible girl
Weak and alluring, well we break our rules
Get drunk in the dark
Laughing aloud at the spinning stars

Believe me, I'm speaking plainly and painfully
Trying to stay elegant, eloquent and akin to you
I see you holding your breath with your arms outstretched
Waiting for someone to come rip open your chest

You take me aside
To solemnly confide
When it comes the time
You plan to give your body to the flame

"Timefighter"

And I'll get old
And I'll get tired
And I won't run
Into the water
You gotta let me go down
Will you remember me as I am now

And I know you're strong
I know you're a manmade fortress
But we're alone
And I'm so willing to be proven wrong

And I fight time
It won in a landslide
I'm just as good as anybody
I'm just as bad as anybody

You talk like you know the walls are thin
And I don't mind if you don't mind me listening
And I'm tired of all these wires
If I go far enough
Will they not follow us

And I fight time
It won in a landslide
I'm just as good as anybody
I'm just as bad as anybody

And I fight time
It won in a landslide
I'm just as good as anybody
I'm just as bad as anybody

"Next Of Kin"

Reading in the phone booth
Sucking on a ginger root
I never got to talk to you
Why is this the image I come back to
Pick my jewelry from the ash
Find the box with the cold hard cash in it
Give it to the next of kin

I used to be too deep inside my head
Now I'm too far out of my skin
Too far out of my skin
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed

I make a desert of my mind
Unfold myself so flat and wide
Have nothing in mind in sight
No cover for my thoughts to hide
Never entered my code
But I held your hand in the pocket of my coat
I learned to be loving and then to be alone
Satisfied body and a hungry soul

I used to be too deep inside my head
Now I'm too far out of my skin
Too far out of my skin
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed

I don't wanna be that man on the train
On a grey commute, imagining fame
Sweet relief, I will never be complete
I will never be complete
I'll never know everything
I will never be complete
I will never be complete
I will never be complete
I'll never know everything

I used to be too deep inside my head
Now I'm too far out of my skin
Too far out of my skin

"Pillar Of Truth"

Your hands are folded
Your eyes are closing
Your words are broken
Your eyes are dry

I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust
I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust

You are your mother's child
You're a mother of a mother of a mother now
Raised in the age of the milkman
I can't claim to understand

I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust
I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust

Lord, prepare me
For the shadows
For the sparrows
At my window
Lord, have mercy
On my descendants
For they know not
What they do
For they know not
Who you are
And they know not
What to do

I, the anchor
I'm slowly sinking
Into darkness
Yet unknown
But the fading
Light around me
Is full of faces
Who carry my name

I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust
I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust

Lord, be near me
My final hour
I once had sight
But now I'm blind
Oh, I tried to be
A second coming
And if I want
Nobody knew
If my throat can't sing
Then my soul
Screams out to you

I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust
I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust

"Historians"

You said "Don't go changing
I'll rearrange to let you in
And I'll be your historian
And you'll be mine
And I'll fill pages of scribbled ink
Hoping the words carry meaning"

Then one day, the motorcade
Covered in flower wreaths
First in a big parade
Will come to take one of us away
Leaving the other with plenty to read

This is what I want to talk about
But somehow the words will not leave my mouth
Was I most complete at the beginning Or the bow
If past you were to meet future me
Would you be holding me here and now

"Fool's Gold"

I drank the dregs of the champagne alone
Warm, flat, coppery coins down my throat
I'm saving up for a rainy day
And I plan to spend it in one place
I threw the party so I could stay put
You brought the bottle like a promise I forgot
A new year begins, it ushers us in
The knot in my gut is coming with

He'll blame the alcohol
And you'll blame the full moon
She'll blame the fall of man
But I blame the part of you
That can't let up on the reigns
You've got life in a chokehold
You say that it's all the same
All glittering fool's gold

I can't tell how big my heart is
Let's open the doors, see how many fit
Like drunks in a bathtub keep piling in
Now I'm locking the door till the morning

He'll blame the alcohol
And you'll blame the full moon
She'll blame the fall of man
And I blame the evening news
For giving us doomsday
And dropping the ball
Building our fear
Like bricks in a wall
He'll blame his mom and dad
And you'll say you understand
She'll blame the wrath of God
And I come up empty-handed
Every time he cries out
You'll blame the altitude
She'll blame society
But I blame the part of you
That can't let up on the reigns
You've got life in a chokehold
You say that it's all the same
All glittering fool's gold

"My Mother & I"

My mother hates her body
We share the same outline
She swears that she loves mine
I blur at the edges
I'm all soft shapes and lines
Shapeshifting all the time

The stars have a lot to say
About babies born in the month of May
We are down-to-earth
We see eye-to-eye
We dig our feet in
My mother and I
My mother and I

They called me an old soul
When I was too young to know
The difference between a soul and a ghost
I feared what was inside
Trapped in my body
Kept from the outside
A spirit searching for a second life

The stars have a lot to say
About women born in the month of May
We want love
Warm and forever
We want to die in the presence of our loved ones
My mother and I
My mother and I

All she has given
All I have taken
All is forgiven
All is forsaken

"Forever Half Mast"

I'm takin' back roads all the way back home
Everything I've done, just a little lovely crow
I didn't choose this town, I can't undo it now
I tried to love the beast no matter what it thinks of me

You're worried that you'll go to Hell
For all the lives that you can't save
For all the money that you waste
For all the good you throw away

Yes, you're evil, but you're not that bad
You put out your palm more than the back of your hand
They were wrong when they said forget the past
Let your flag fly at forever half mast
Let your flag fly at forever half mast

We're in a state of disarray united by our darkest days
Achin' from the growing pains, they always say it's just a phase
America, the tried and true, red and white and black and blue
Tell me, who did this to you If it was me I hardly knew

Yes, you're evil, but you're not that bad
You put out your palm more than the back of your hand
They were wrong when they said forget the past
Let your flag fly at forever half mast
Let your flag fly at forever half mast

Off you run and run for more
Nobody escaped before
Wait for something magical
Mistake turn into miracle

"Last Christmas"

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognize me
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

Marry Christmas
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying "I love you", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover, but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love
You'll never fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

"Hot & Heavy"

Being back here makes me hot in the face
Hot blood in my pulsing veins
Heavy memories weighing on my brain
Hot and heavy in the basement of your parents' place
You used to be so sweet
Now you're a firecracker on a crowded street
Couldn't look away even if I wanted
Try to walk away but I come back to the start

Get me to the floor even though I'm not a dancer
Ask me all the questions that your parents wouldn't answer
How could I deny it, diamond in the rough
You let me in your world until you had enough
You knew that I wanted you to bend the rules
How did I believe I had a hold on you
You were always stronger than people suspected
Underestimated and overprotected
When I went away it was the only option
Couldn't trust myself to proceed with caution
The most that I could give to you is nothing at all
The best that I could offer was to miss your calls

Being back here makes me hot in the face
Hot blood in my pulsing veins
Heavy memories weighing on my brain
Hot and heavy in the basement of your parents' place
You used to be so sweet
Now you're a firecracker on a crowded street
Couldn't look away even if I wanted
Try to walk away but I come back to the start

And it happens over and over, and over and over again
Over and over, and over and over again
I wish I was over it, over it, over it, over it

A hidden gem, my own goldmine
You had the wide and wild eyes
You were a secret to yourself
You couldn't keep from anyone else
Now you're the biggest brightest flame
You are a fire that can't be tamed
You're better than ever, but I knew you when
It's bittersweet to see you again

"Christine"

You're falling asleep on my shoulder in the back of your boyfriend's car
We're coming home from a sermon saying how bent and evil we are
I tried to imagine what you're dreaming, you're muttering nonsense between steady breathing
I have to wake you up to get out, your man waves from the end of the drive 'til I'm in the house

He can be nice, sometimes
Other nights, you admit he's not what you had in mind
All in all, nobody's perfect
There may be better, but you don't feel worth it
That's where we disagree

You always wanted to raise a baby by the lake
Maybe they'll grow up and never make the same mistakes
Knowing you, they'd be the first kid to never hurt another
I see you look at him and wonder if he'll make you a mother

But if you get married, I'd object
Throw my shoe at the altar and lose your respect
I'd rather lose my dignity
Than lose you to somebody who won't make you happy

"First Time"

Broke into the screened-in porch
Now I'm crawling through the dog door
I may let you see me on my knees
But you never see me on all fours

Drooling on the tile
I'm a starfish on the kitchen floor
Catch my breath to breathe your name
I'm just the fool you took me for

You can feel it for the first time, the second time
You can feel it for the first time, the second time

You gave me your hands 'cause you
Didn't know what to with them
And I showed you the way
Even though I'd never been

Where did we go right
I think about it all the time
If I had paid closer attention
Maybe I could take us back to there and then

You can feel it for the first time, the second time
You can feel it for the first time, the second time
I can't go back to who I was before I met you
I can't undo with I've done, I wouldn't want to
I wouldn't want to, I wouldn't want to

Sneaking out of the house
I must be out of my mind
I'm running out of excuses
We're running out of time

You say the love will come and go
We'll learn to rude the ebb and flow
You always leave before the light
Come back, same time and place the next night

And how will I know if history repeats itself
How will I know when it's gonna come back around
How will I know Has my face changed, baby
How will I know I'll stay ready for you to take me
Take me, take me
Take me

"VBS"

In the summer of '07 I was sure I'd go to heaven
But I was hedging my bets at VBS
The preacher in a t-shirt told me I could be a leader
Taught me how to build a fire and to spread the word

In the evening everybody went to worship and weep
Hands above our heads, reaching for God
Back in the cabin, snorting nutmeg in your bunk bed
You were waiting for a revelation of your own

Sedentary secrets like peach pits in your gut
Locked away like jam jars in the cellar of your heart
Waiting to be tasted and ultimately wasted
You were gonna win me over from the start

The poetry was so bad
It took a lot to not laugh
You said that I showed you the light
But all it did in the end
Was make the dark feel darker than before

Your dad keeps his sleeves down through the summer for a reason
Your mother wears her makeup extra thick for a reason
When I tell you you were born and you are here for a reason
You are not convinced the reason is a good one

While you're going to sleep your mind keeps you awake
And it makes your heart beat fast and loud
There's nothing you can do but the only thing you found
Playing Slayer at full volume helps to block it out

The poetry was so bad
It took a lot to not laugh
You said that I showed you the light
But all it did in the end
Was make the dark feel darker than before
Dark feel darker than before
Dark feel darker than before

"Cartwheel"

Here and there and gone again
Firefly juice on your skin
You're glowing like an atom bomb
This natural thing that you've undone
Outgrew older sister's clothes again
Won't admit you're growing tall and thin
You like your body pulling at the seams
You're not prepared for what the future brings

Curse words and empty cups
Cracked blacktop curling up
Heatwave by midday
Heat lightning on a summer night
And I remember when you used to call
Holed up in the closet in the hall
Scared you wouldn't live to 45
The same age as your father when he died
You'd say, "We need to talk
Sneak out, meet me on your block"
I'd sit by you, silent on the curb
What to say when there is not a word
Spell broke at daybreak
Light another candle on the cake
Cartwheel and a broken wrist
Skin scarred and sun-kissed

When you told me 'bout your first time
A soccer player at the senior high
I felt my body crumple to the floor-
Betrayal like I'd never felt before
I thought back to many years ago
A late night promise on the telephone
We'd build a house of twigs and vines
Grow old together just to pass the time
Now there's only past and present day
I can't believe a word you say
The future isn't worth its weight in gold
The future is a benevolent black hole

"Thumbs"

You hung up the phone
And I asked you what was wrong
Your dad has come to town
He'd like to meet
I said "You don't have to see him"
But for whatever reason you can't tell him no

So we meet him at a bar
You were holding my hand hard
He ordered rum and coke
I can't drink either anymore
He hadn't seen you since the fifth grade
Now you're nineteen and you're five-eight
He said "Honey, you sure look great
Do you get the checks I send on your birthday"

I would kill him
If you let me
I would kill him
Quick and easy
Your nails are digging
Into my knee
I don't know
How you keep smiling

I love your eyes
And he has them
But you have his
'Cause he was first
I imagine my thumbs on the irises
Pressing in until they burst

I clear my throat
And say we ought to get home
He offers us a ride
I reply "No, that's alright"
When we leave
You feel him watching
So we walk a mile in the wrong direction

I would kill him
If you let me
I would kill him
Quick and easy
Your nails are digging
Into my knee
I don't know
How you keep smiling
I don't know
How you keep smiling
I don't know
How you keep smiling

I wanna take your face between my hands and say
"You two are connected by a pure coincidence
Bound to him by blood, but baby, it's all relative
You've been in his fist ever since you were a kid
But you don't owe him shit even if he said you did
You don't owe him shit even if he said you did"

"Going Going Gone"

Daniel made a pass
We started flirting after class
Stealing hats and trading jackets
Locking lips and braces brackets
After dinner, before dark
We'd meet at the same bench in the park
Sweaty palms, averted eyes
Wasn't sure if he and I were going out

Going out
Going out, ooh
Going, going, out

The sunset threw a tantrum
It wasn't ready to go just yet
Mother Earth said, "Time for bed"
It resisted and the sky went red
The color filtered out
Like pulling teeth out of a cloud
The bloody battle ended
No, the sun can't break the habit of going down

Going down
Going down, ooh
Going, going, down

Daniel in ten years
Grabbing asses, spilling beers
Another ten and he'll have a daughter
She'll grow up and he can't stop her
Back on the bench, making plans
Watching the day end hand in hand
I always had to be home by eight
My dad would kill me if I was late
I'll be going now

Going now
Going now, ooh
Going, going, now

Going gone
Going gone
Going gone, ooh
Going, going, gone

"Cool, yeah that was the one I think"
"Yup that was great, that's what we were looking for. Thanks guys"
"Cool, wow I am so happy. Thank you everyone for doing this. I owe y'all whatever you ask of me for the rest of my life"

"Partner in Crime"

When I asked you to coffee
Could you tell I don't drink it
When I got to the caf
Could you tell what I was thinking
My heart's on my sleeve, it's embarrassing
The pulpy thing, beating

When you asked my age, I lied
I saw relief dawn on your eyes
It's not your fault, it's mine
Let the record show
I walked in on my own

Knee deep in the city that never sleeps
I lay down in the middle of the street
Lamplight like parallel suns
Crowding out the early morning stars
Concrete holding heat from the daytime
Picking petals to see if you will be mine

Do you love me, do you love me not
Do you love me, do you love me not
Do you love me, do you love me not
Do you love me, do you love me, not

You were my partner in crime
It was a welcome waste of time
Eating cherries on the bridge, feet dangling
Throwing the pits and stems into the racing current below
I get vertigo looking down, and looking in

Drop me off at the curb by my curfew
Round the corner so nobody sees you
You drop a hint that you got a girlfriend
I tried my best not to take it
I wanna run my fingers through you
You say nobody understands you like I do

But do you love me, do you love me not
Do you love me, do you love me not
Do you love me, do you love me not
Do you love me, do you love me, not

"Brando"

You told me to skip school
To go with you to the movies
You knew you were uncool
But you thought you could fool me
They play oldies in the afternoon
For the elderly, and me and you
Fred and Ginger, black and white
I watch you watch 'It's a Wonderful Life'

You called me cerebral
I didn't know what you meant
But now I do, would it have killed you
To call me pretty instead
I'm in a second story window
And you're yelling at me "Stella"
And I'm laughing 'cause you think you're Brando
But you'll never come close

All I need for you to admit
Is that you never knew me like you thought you did
You never knew me like you thought you did
Like you thought you did

You say, "Here's looking at you kid"
Thinking I wouldn't understand the reference
You admit, you think we're fated
I'll be lucky if I'm your third wife
That's only something you would say in the car
We've been breathing the same air for too long
If the snow wasn't coming down so hard
I would open the door and walk home
It's only a couple miles
What could go wrong
If I hitch a ride with a guy in a pick-up
Who doesn't know left, from right, from wrong

All I need for you to admit
Is that you never knew me like you thought you did
You never knew me like you thought you did
Like you thought you did

All I need for you to admit
Is that you never knew me like you thought you did
You never knew me like you thought you did
Like you thought you did

"Please Stay"

Your clothes in the dryer
Your hair on the shower wall
Your toothbrush is too much
Your shoes empty in the hall
Your keys on the counter
Your dirty dish in the sink
Please, don't make me see these things

The books on your shelf that you never read
The hunting knife you kept by your bed
The flowers you dried and tied up with twine
Suspended from the ceiling

You tell me you love me, like it'll be the last time
Like you're playing out, the end of a storyline
I say I love you too, because it's true
What else am I supposed to do
Maybe bar the door when you move to leave

I think you mean what you say
When you say you wanna die
I think you mean what you say
When you say you want to stay alive

Quit your job
Cut your hair
Get a dog
Change your name
Change your mind
Change your ways
Give them time
Go back to school, go back to sleep
Tell the secret you can't keep
Begin, be done
Break a vow, make a new one
Call me if you need a friend, or never talk to me again

But please stay
But please stay
But please stay
But please stay

"Triple Dog Dare"

I'm not tired yet
We still got a lot to figure out
Like what was the end of the movie about, anyways
You're yawning on your couch
I wonder if I overstayed my welcome
Until you asked me if I'd like to take a walk
We're going to the five and dime
The only open place at this time of night
You're dancing in the aisle 'cause the radio
Is singing you a song you know
And the kid at the counter is gawking at your grace
I can tell what he's thinking by the look on his face
It's not his fault, I'm sure I look the same
It's what you do but it's not you I blame

Your mama read my palm
She wouldn't tell me what it was she saw
But after that, you weren't allowed to spend the night
I'm staring at my hands
Red, ruddy skin, I don't understand
How did they betray me What did I do
I never touched you how I wanted to
What can I say to your mom to let you come outside
You know I'll be seeking if you run and hide
If the door were to open, would you walk through the frame
If you're too afraid, it won't be you I blame

You passed a note in class
Told me to meet you at the overpass
Your lip was trembling when you said that we are cursed
You're trying not to cry
When you tell me you're afraid that we may die
I said "So what Everybody's scared of that"
I want you to tell me that you miss me
Want you to hold and hurt and kiss me
I wanna run away and live on your family's boat
It's a triple dog dare, you're a chicken if you don't
I can fish for our food and you know how to start a flame
If you don't get out now you'll only have yourself to blame

You said, "You have me there
If it's a triple dog dare"
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare

They put our faces on the milk jugs
Missing children 'til they gave up
Your mama was right, and through the grief
Can't fight the feeling of relief
Nothing worse could happen now
Nothing worse could happen now
Nothing worse could happen now

"Kissing Lessons"

Rachel was a year older
When I was in the second grade
I thought she might know everything
I took her word like a golden ring
I asked her how to win my man
And she said, "I know just the thing"
Gave me lipgloss and a hair toss
And, after school, a lesson in kissing

She called me by the name of a crush
I couldn't decide if she was Cole or Justin
I think I called her baby or darling most the time

We'd take turns being seduced
Imagining the day it would come into use
Imagining the day we'd start breaking hearts
And taking names

She wanted a three-story house
I wanted to live by a body of water
With my children and their father
Children and their father
Three sons and a beautiful daughter (Oh)

Rachel's family moved out of town
I don't remember when we stopped hanging out
But I still wear a letter R charm on my bracelet
And wonder if she thinks of me as her first kiss

"Thumbs Again"

You hung up the phone
And I asked you what was wrong
Your dad has come to town
He'd like to meet
I said, "You don't have to see him"
But for whatever reason, you can't tell him no

So we meet him at a bar
You were holding my hand hard
He ordered rum and Coke
I can't drink either anymore
He hadn't seen you since the fifth grade
Now you're nineteen and you're 5'8"
He said, "Honey, you sure look great
Do you get the checks I send on your birthday"

I would kill him
If you let me
I would kill him
Quick and easy
Your nails are digging
Into my knee
I don't know how you keep smiling

I love your eyes
And he has 'em
Or you have his
'Cause he was first
I imagine my thumbs on the irises
Pressing in until they burst

I clear my throat
And say we ought to get home
He offers us a ride
I reply, "No, that's alright"
And when we leave
You feel him watching
So we walk a mile in the wrong direction

I would kill him
If you let me
I would kill him
Quick and easy
Your nails are digging

I don't know how you keep smiling

I wanna take your face between my hands and say
"You two are connected by a pure coincidence
Bound to him by blood, but baby, it's all relative
You've been in his fist ever since you were a kid
But you don't owe him shit even if he said you did
You don't owe him shit even if he said you did"

"brutal"

I want it to be, like, messy

I'm so insecure, I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I if not exploited
And I'm so sick of seventeen
Where's my fucking teenage dream
If someone tells me one more time
"Enjoy your youth," I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious, and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more

All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get
Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here

(Yeah)

I feel like no one wants me
And I hate the way I'm perceived
I only have two real friends
And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
'Cause I love people I don't like
And I hate every song I write
And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart
And I can't even parallel park

All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get
Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here

(Yeah)
(Just havin' a really good time)

Got a broken ego, broken heart
(Yeah, it's brutal out here, yeah, it's brutal out here)
And God, I don't even know where to start

"traitor"

Brown guilty eyes and little white lies
Yeah, I played dumb but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

And ain't it funny
How you ran to her
The second that we called it quits

And ain't it funny
How you said you were friends
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

You talked to her
When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter

It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still a traitor

Now you bring her around
Just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy

And I know if you were true
There's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

Ain't it funny
All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid

Ain't it funny
Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

You talked to her
When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter

It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still a traitor

God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
When she's sleeping in the bed we made
Don't you dare forget about the way

You betrayed me
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

You talked to her
When we were together
You gave me your word
But that didn't matter

It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still

You're still a traitor
Yeah, you're still a traitor

God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you

"drivers license"

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else

And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
Oh, and I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street

Red lights
Stop signs
I still see your face
In the white cars
Front yards
Can't drive past the places
We used to
Go to
'Cause I still fucking love you, babe

Sidewalks
We crossed
I still hear your voice
In the traffic
We're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue
Know we're through
But I still fucking love you, babe

I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever now I drive alone past your street

"1 step forward, 3 steps back"

Called you on the phone today
Just to ask you how you were
All I did was speak normally
Somehow I still struck a nerve

You got me fucked up in the head, boy
Never doubted myself so much
Like am I pretty Am I fun, boy
I hate that I gave you power over that kind of stuff

'Cause it's always one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me, boy I don't understand
No, I don't understand

And maybe in some masochistic way
I kind of find it all exciting
Like which lover will I get today
Will you walk me to the door or send me home cryin'

It's one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me, boy I don't understand

No, it's back and forth, did I say something wrong
It's back and forth, going over everything I said
It's back and forth, did I do something wrong
It's back and forth, maybe, this is all your fault instead

It's one step forward and three steps back
And I'd leave you, but the roller coaster's all I've ever had
Yeah, it's one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me, boy
I don't understand
No, I don't understand

"deja vu"

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin' 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin' in harmony
I bet she's braggin'
To all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you

Do you get dj vu when she's with you
Do you get dj vu Ah, hmm
Do you get dj vu, huh

Do you call her, almost say my name
'Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
'Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (I love you)

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the song she's singing now when she's with you

Do you get dj vu when she's with you
Do you get dj vu (Oh-oh)
Do you get dj vu

Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel
A different girl now, but there's nothing new

I know you get dj vu
I know you get dj vu
I know you get dj vu

"good 4 u"

Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world

And good for you, I guess that you've been working on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really taking off
It's like we never even happened, baby
What the fuck is up with that

And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you
Well, screw that and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily

"enough for you"

I wore make-up when we dated
'Cause I thought you'd like me more
If I looked like the other prom queens
I know that you loved before
Tried so hard to be everything that you like
Just for you to say you're not the compliment type

And I knew how you took your coffee
And your favourite songs by heart
I read all of your self-help books so you'd think that I was smart
Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me
I knew from the start this is exactly how you'd leave

You found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
Yeah all I ever wanted was to be enough for you

And maybe I'm just not as interesting as the girls you had before
But God, you couldn't have cared less about
Someone who loved you more
I'd say you broke my heart
But you broke much more than that
Now, I don't want your sympathy
I just want myself back before

You found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough

Don't you think I loved you too much
To be used and discarded
Don't you think I loved you too much
To think I deserve nothing
But don't tell me you're sorry, boy
Feel sorry for yourself
'Cause someday, I'll be everything to somebody else

And they'll think that I'm so exciting
And you'll be the one who's cryin'
Yeah, you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
You say I'm never satisfied
But that's not me, it's you

'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough
But I don't think anything could ever be enough
For you
Enough for you
No, nothing's enough for you

"happier"

We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine
You know I know you've moved on
Found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you

And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet
She's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me

Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know
I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy but don't be happier

And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me

And now I'm picking her apart
Like cutting her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful
She looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know
I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better

I hope you're happy
I wish you all the best
Really
Say you love her, baby
Just not like you loved me
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy
But don't be happier

I hope you're happy
Just not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know
Can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy but don't be happier

"jealousy, jealousy"

I kinda wanna throw my phone across the room
'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true
With paper-white teeth and perfect bodies
Wish I didn't care

I know their beauty's not my lack
But it feels like that weight is on my back
And I can't let it go

Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself
I'd rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
My jealousy, jealousy started followin' me (He-he-he, he)
Started followin' me (He-he-he, he)

And I see everyone gettin' all the things I want
I'm happy for them, but then again, I'm not
Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos
I can't stand it
Oh God, I sound crazy

Their win is not my loss
I know it's true, but
I can't help gettin' caught up in it all

Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself
Rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
My jealousy, jealousy (Yeah)

All your friends are so cool, you go out every night
In your daddy's nice car, yeah, you're livin' the life
Got a pretty face, a pretty boyfriend, too
I wanna be you so bad and I don't even know you
All I see is what I should be
Happier, prettier, jealousy, jealousy
All I see is what I should be
I'm losin' it, all I get's jealousy, jealousy

Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
And I'm so sick of myself
Rather be, rather be (Oh, oh)
Anyone, anyone else (Anybody else)
Jealousy, jealousy
Oh, I'm so sick of myself
I'd rather be, rather be (Oh-oh-oh)
Anyone, anyone else
Jealousy, jealousy started followin' me

"favorite crime"

Know that I loved you so bad
I let you treat me like that
I was your willing accomplice, honey

And I watched as you fled the scene
Doe-eyed as you buried me
One heart broke, four hands bloody

The things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

You used me as an alibi
I crossed my heart as you crossed the line
And I defended you to all my friends

And now, every time a siren sounds
I wonder if you're around
'Cause you know that I'd do it all again

Oh, the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

It's bittersweet to think about the damage that we'd do
'Cause I was going down, but I was doing it with you
Yeah, everything we broke, and all the trouble that we made
But I say that I hate you with a smile on my face

Oh, look what we became

Oh, the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
Oh, the things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

Your favorite crime
Your favorite crime
'Cause baby, you were mine

"hope ur ok"

I knew a boy once, when I was small
A tow-head blond, with eyes of salt
He played the drum in the marching band
His parents cared more about the Bible
Than being good to their own child
He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad

And somehow, we fell out of touch
Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush
Don't know if I'll see you again someday
But if you're out there, I hope that you're OK

My middle school friend grew up alone
She raised her brothers on her own
Her parents hated who she loved
She couldn't wait to go to college
She was tired 'cause she was brought
Into a world where family was merely blood

Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
We don't talk much but I just gotta say
"I miss you, and I hope that you're OK."

Address the letters, to the holes in my butterfly wings
Nothing's forever, nothing's as good as it seems
And when the clouds won't iron out
And the monsters creep into your house
And every door is hard to close

Well, I hope you know how proud I am you were created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
God, I hope that you're happier today
'Cause I love you, and I hope that you're OK

"all-american bitch"

I am light as a feather, I'm as stiff as a board
I pay attention to things that most people ignore
And I'm alright with the movies
That make jokes 'bout senseless cruelty, that's for sure
And I am built like a mother and a total machine
I feel for your every little issue, I know just what you mean
And I make light of the darkness
I've got sun in my motherfuckin' pocket, best believe
Yeah, you know me, I

Forgive, and I forget
I know my age, and I act like it
Got what you can't resist
I'm a perfect all-American

I am light as a feather, I'm as fresh as the air
Coca-Cola bottles that I only use to curl my hair
I got class and integrity
Just like a goddamn Kennedy, I swear
With love to spare, I

Forgive, and I forget
I know my age, and I act like it
Got what you can't resist
I'm a perfect all-American bitch
With perfect all-American lips
And perfect all-American hips
I know my place
I know my place, and this is it

I don't get angry when I'm pissed
I'm the eternal optimist
I scream inside to deal with it, like, "Ah"
Like, "Ah" (Oh my fucking God)

All the time
I'm grateful all the time
I'm sexy, and I'm kind
I'm pretty when I cry
Oh, all the time
I'm grateful all the time (Grateful all the fucking time)
I'm sexy, and I'm kind
I'm pretty when I cry

"bad idea right"

Hey

Haven't heard from you in a couple of months
But I'm out right now and I'm all fucked up
And you're callin' my phone and you're all alone
And I'm sensing some undertone
And I'm right here with all my friends
But you're sending me your new address
And I know we're done, I know we're through
But, God, when I look at you

My brain goes, "Ah"
Can't hear my thoughts (I cannot hear my thoughts)
Like blah-blah-blah (Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah)
Should probably not
I should probably, probably not
I should probably, probably not

Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right
Seeing you tonight
Fuck it, it's fine

Yes, I know that he's my ex
But can't two people reconnect
I only see him as a friend
The biggest lie I ever said
Oh, yes, I know that he's my ex
But can't two people reconnect
I only see him as a friend
I just tripped and fell into his bed

Now I'm gettin' in the car, wreckin' all my plans
I know I should stop, but I can't
And I told my friends I was asleep
But I never said where or in whose sheets
And I pull up to your place on the second floor
And you're standing, smiling at the door
And I'm sure I've seen much hotter men
But I really can't remember when

My brain goes, "Ah"
Can't hear my thoughts (I cannot hear my thoughts)
Like blah-blah-blah (Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah)
Should probably not
I should probably, probably not
I should probably, probably not

Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right
Seeing you tonight
Fuck it, it's fine

Yes, I know that he's my ex
But can't two people reconnect
I only see him as a friend
The biggest lie I ever said
Oh, yes, I know that he's my ex
But can't two people reconnect
I only see him as a friend
I just tripped and fell into his bed

Oh, yes, I know that he's my ex
Can't two people reconnect
The biggest lie I ever said
I just tripped and fell into his bed
My brain goes, "Ah"
Can't hear my thoughts
The biggest lie I ever said
My brain goes, "Ah"
Can't hear my thoughts
I just tripped and fell into his bed

Thoughts
Blah
Thoughts
Blah

"vampire"

Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it

I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity

'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so nave
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, famefucker
Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire

Every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy God I hate the way I called them crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching (How do you lie, how do you lie, how do you lie)

Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her
'Cause girls your age know better

I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so nave
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, famefucker
Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire

You said it was true love
But wouldn't that be hard
You can't love anyone
'Cause that would mean you had a heart
I tried to help you out
Now I know that I can't
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing
I'll never understand

I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so nave
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, famefucker
Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire

"lacy"

Lacy, oh, Lacy, skin like puff pastry
Aren't you the sweetest thing on this side of Hell
Dear angel Lacy, eyes white as daisies
Did I ever tell you that I'm not doin' well

Ooh, I care, I care, I care
Like perfume that you wear, I linger all the time
Watching, hidden in plain sight
Ooh, I try, I try, I try
But it takes over my life, I see you everywhere
The sweetest torture one could bear

Smart, sexy Lacy, I'm losin' it lately
I feel your compliments like bullets on skin
Dazzling starlet, Bardot reincarnate
Well, aren't you the greatest thing to ever exist

Ooh, I care, I care, I care
Like ribbons in your hair, my stomach's all in knots
You got the one thing that I want
Ooh, I try, I try, I try
Try to rationalize, people are people, but
It's like you're made of angel dust

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

Lacy, oh, Lacy, it's like you're out to get me
You poison every little thing that I do
Lacy, oh, Lacy, I just loathe you lately
And I despise my jealous eyes and how hard they fell for you
Yeah, I despise my rotten mind and how much it worships you

"ballad of a homeschooled girl"

Cat got my tongue
And I don't think I get along with anyone
Blood running cold
I'm on the outside of the greatest inside joke
And I hate all my clothes
Feels like my skin doesn't fit right over my bones
So I guess I should go
The party's done, and I'm no fun, I know, I know
I know, I know

I broke a glass, I tripped and fell
I told secrets I shouldn't tell
I stumbled over all my words
I made it weird, I made it worse
Each time I step outside
It's social suicide
It's social suicide
Wanna curl up and die
It's social suicide

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah

I laughed at the wrong time, sat with the wrong guy (Uh-huh)
Searchin' "how to start a conversation" on a website (How to flirt)
I talked to this hot guy, swore I was his type
Guess that he was makin' out with boys, like the whole night (Oh)
Everythin' I do is tragic (Oh)
Every guy I like is gay (Oh)
The morning after I panic (Oh)
Oh God, what did I say (Oh, oh, oh)

I broke a glass, I tripped and fell
I told secrets I shouldn't tell
I stumbled over all my words
I made it weird, I made it worse
Each time I step outside
It's social suicide
It's social suicide
Wanna curl up and die
It's social suicide
Yeah, when I'm alone, I'm fine
But don't let me out at night
It's social suicide
It's social suicide

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah

I broke a glass, tripped and fell
Told secrets I shouldn't tell
Stumbled over all my words
Made it weird, then made it worse
Each day that I'm alive
It's social suicide
It's social suicide
Wanna curl up and die
It's social suicide
It's social suicide
Don't let me out at night
I'm shocked I'm still alive
It's social suicide

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-a
