h-ah, ah-ah

Thought your mom was your wife (Ah)
Called you the wrong name twice (Ah)
Can't think of a third line (Ah)
La-la-la-la-la-la (Ah)
La-la-la-la-la-la (Ah)
La-la-la-la-la-la (Ah)
La-la-la-la-la-la, ugh

"making the bed"

Want it, so I got it, did it, so it's done
Another thing I ruined, I used to do for fun
Another piece of plastic I could just throw away
Another conversation with nothing good to say
I thought it, so I said it, took it 'cause I can
Another day pretendin' I'm older than I am
Another perfect moment that doesn't feel like mine
Another thing I forced to be a sign

Well, sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
Gettin' drunk at a club with my fair-weather friends
Push away all the people who know me the best
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
I'm so tired of bein' the girl that I am
Every good thing has turned into somethin' I dread
And I'm playin' the victim so well in my head
But it's me who's been makin' the bed

Me who's been makin' the bed
Pull the sheets over my head, yeah
Makin' the bed

And every night, I wake up from this one recurrin' dream
Where I'm drivin' through the city, and the brakes go out on me
I can't stop at the red light, can't swerve off the road
I read somewhere it's 'cause my life feels so out of control
And I tell someone I love them just as a distraction
They tell me that they love me like I'm some tourist attraction
They're changin' my machinery, and I just let it happen
I got the things I wanted, it's just not what I imagined

Well, sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
Gettin' drunk at a club with my fair-weather friends
Push away all the people who know me the best
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
I'm so tired of bein' the girl that I am
Every good thing has turned into somethin' I dread
And I'm playin' the victim so well in my head
But it's me who's been makin' the bed

Me who's been makin' the bed
Pull the sheets over my head, yeah
Makin' the bed

Sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
Countin' all of the beautiful things I regret
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
Me who's been makin' the bed
Pull the sheets over my head
Makin' the bed, oh-oh

"logical"

Master manipulator
God, you're so good at what you do
Come for me like a savior
And I'd put myself through hell for you
Hear all the rumors lately
That you always denied

And I fell for you like water
Falls from the February sky
But now the current's stronger
And I couldn't get out if I tried
But you convinced me, baby
It was all in my mind
And now you got me thinking

Two plus two equals five
And I'm the love of your life
'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
Then changin' you is possible
No, love is never logical

You built a giant castle
With walls so high, I couldn't see
The way it all unraveled
And all the things you did to me
You lied, you lied, you lied
Oh
And now you got me thinkin'

Two plus two equals five
And I'm the love of your life
'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
Then changin' you is possible
I guess love is never logical

The sky is green, the grass is red
And you mean all those words you said
I'm sure that girl is really your friend
Our problems are all solvable
'Cause lovin' you is lovin' every

Argument you held over my head
Brought up the girls you could have instead
Said I was too young, I was too soft
Can't take a joke, can't get you off
Oh, why do I do this
I look so stupid thinkin'

Two plus two equals five
And I'm the love of your life
'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
Then changin' you is possible
No, love is never logical

Logical, logical, love is never logical
I know I'm half responsible and that makes me feel horrible

Oh, logical, logical, love is never logical
I know I could've stopped it all, God, why didn't I stop it all

Oh, logical, logical, love is never logical
I know I'm half responsible and that makes me feel horrible

Oh, logical, logical, love is never logical
I know I could've stopped it all, God, why didn't I stop it all

"get him back"

One, two, three
Wait, is this the song with the drums

I met a guy in the summer and I left him in the spring
He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye
He said he's six-foot-two and I'm like, "Dude, nice try"
But he was so much fun and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties and the night would never end
Another song, another club, another bar, another dance
And when he said something wrong, he'd just fly me to France
So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed
'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend
Do I love him Do I hate him I guess it's up and down
If I had to choose, I would say right now

I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge
And I want him again
I want to get him back, back, back

So I write him all these letters, then I throw them in the trash
'Cause I miss the way he kisses and the way he made me laugh
Yeah, I pour my little heart out, but as I'm hitting "send"
I picture all the faces of my disappointed friends
Because everyone knew all of the shit that he'd do
He said I was the only girl, but that just wasn't the truth
And when I told him how he hurt me, he'd tell me I was trippin'
But I am my father's daughter, so maybe I could fix him

I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge
And I want him again
I want to get him back (And then And then)
I want to get him back, back, back

I wanna key his car (I want to get him back)
I wanna make him lunch (But then I, I want to get him back)
I wanna break his heart (But then I, I want to get him back)
Then be the one to stitch it up (But then I, I want to get him back)
Wanna kiss his face (But then I, I want to get him back)
With an uppercut (But then I, I want to get him back)
I wanna meet his mom (But then I, I want to get him back)
Just to tell her her son sucks (But then I, I want to get him back)
Oh, I wanna key his car, I wanna make him lunch (But then I, I want to get him back, I want to)
I wanna break his heart, stitch it right back up (But then I, I want to get him back, get him back)
I wanna kiss his face with an uppercut (But then I, I want to get him back, I want to)
I wanna meet his mom and tell her her son sucks, yeah (But then I, I want to get him back, get him back)

I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge
And I want him again
I want to get him back (And then And then)
I want to get him back (Back, back)

I'll get him, I'll get him, I'll get him, I'll get him back (Woo-hoo)
Get him back (Come on, come on, woo)
I'm gonna get him so good, he's not even gonna know what hit him
He's gonna love me and hate me at the same time
(Get him back, girl, you better get him back)
(You got it, got it)
Oh, I don't know, I got him good, I got him really good

"love is embarrassing"

I told my friends you were the one
After I'd known you like a month
And then you kissed some girl from high school
And I stayed in bed for like a week
When you said space was what you need
Waited by my phone like a goddamn fool

And now it don't mean a thing
God, love's fucking embarrassing
Just watch as I crucify myself
For some weird second string
Loser who's not worth mentionin'
My God, love's embarrassing as hell

And I consoled you while you cried
Over your ex-girlfriend's new guy
My God, how could I be so stupid
You found a new version of me
And I damn near started World War III
Jesus, what was I even doing

'Cause now it don't mean a thing
God, love's fucking embarrassing
Just watch as I crucify myself
For some weird second string
Loser who's not worth mentionin'
My God, love's embarrassing as hell

I give up, give up
I give up everything
I placed my bets and
It's not worth anything
I give up, give up
But I keep comin' back for more

Yeah, it don't mean a thing
God, love's fucking embarrassing
Just watch as I crucify myself
For some weird second string
Loser who's not worth mentionin'
My God, love's embarrassing as hell

Yeah, yeah, I give up, give up
I give up everything
I'm plannin' out my wedding
With some guy I'm never marryin'
I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up
But I keep comin' back for more

"the grudge"

I have nightmares each week about that Friday in May
One phone call from you and my entire world was changed
Trust that you betrayed, confusion that still lingers
You took everything I loved and crushed it in between your fingers
And I doubt you ever think about the damage that you did
But I hold on to every detail like my life depends on it
My undying love, now I hold it like a grudge
And I hear your voice every time that I think I'm not enough

And I try to be tough, but I wanna scream
How could anybody do the things you did so easily
And I say I don't care, I say that I'm fine
But you know I can't let it go
I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long
It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong

The arguments that I have won against you in my head
In the shower, in the car and in the mirror before bed
Yeah, I'm so tough when I'm alone and I make you feel so guilty
And I fantasize about a time you're a little fucking sorry
And I try to understand why you would do this all to me
You must be insecure, you must be so unhappy
And I know in my heart hurt people hurt people
And we both drew blood, but, man, those cuts were never equal

And I try to be tough, but I wanna scream
How could anybody do the things you did so easily
And I say I don't care, I say that I'm fine
But you know I can't let it go
I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long
It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong

Ooh, do you think I deserved it all
Ooh, your flower's filled with vitriol
You built me up to watch me fall
You have everything and you still want more

I try to be tough, I try to be mean
But even after all this, you're still everything to me
And I know you don't care, I guess that that's fine
But you know I can't let it go
I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long
It takes strength to forgive, but I'm not quite sure I'm there yet
It takes strength to forgive, but

"pretty isn't pretty"

Bought a bunch of makeup
Tryna' cover up my face
I started to skip lunch
Stopped eatin' cake on birthdays
Bought a new prescription
To try and stay calm
'Cause there's always something missin'
There's always something in the mirror that I think looks wrong

When pretty isn't pretty enough
What do you do
And everybody's keepin' it up
So you think it's you
I could change up my body and change up my face
I could try every lipstick in every shade
But I'd always feel the same
'Cause pretty isn't pretty enough anyways

You can win the battle
But you'll never win the war
Fix the things you hated
And you'd still feel so insecure

And I try to ignore it, but it's everything I see
It's on the posters on the wall, it's in the shitty magazines
It's in my phone, it's in my head, it's in the boys I bring to bed
It's all around, it's all the time and I don't know why I even try

When pretty isn't pretty enough
What do you do
And everybody's keepin' it up
So you think it's you
I could change up my body and change up my face
I could try every lipstick in every shade
But I'd always feel the same
'Cause pretty isn't pretty enough

And I bought all the clothes that they told me to buy
I chased some dumb ideal my whole fucking life
And none of it matters and none of it ends
You just feel like shit over and over again

No, it'll never change
Pretty isn't pretty enough
Everybody's keepin' it up
Pretty isn't pretty enough
Pretty isn't

"teenage dream"

When am I gonna stop being wise beyond my years and just start being wise
When am I gonna stop being a pretty young thing to guys
When am I gonna stop being great for my age and just start being good
When will it stop being cool to be quietly misunderstood

I'll blow out the candles, happy birthday to me
Got your whole life ahead of you, you're only nineteen
But I fear that they already got all the best parts of me
And I'm sorry that I couldn't always be your teenage dream

And when does wide-eyed affection and all good intentions start to not be enough
When will everyone have every reason to call all my bluffs
And when are all my excuses of learning my lessons gonna start to feel sad
Will I spend all the rest of my years wishing I could go back

I'll blow out the candles, happy birthday to me
Got your whole life ahead of you, you're only nineteen
But I fear that they already got all the best parts of me
And I'm sorry that I couldn't always be your teenage dream

They all say that it gets better
It gets better the more you grow
Yeah, they all say that it gets better
It gets better, but what if I don't
Oh, they all say that it gets better
It gets better the more you grow
Yeah, they all say that it gets better
It gets better, but what if I don't
Oh, they all say that it gets better
It gets better the more you grow
Yeah, they all say that it gets better
It gets better, but what if I don't
Oh, they all say that it gets better
It gets better the more you grow
Yeah, they all say that it gets better
It gets better, but what if I don't

Is this recording
Of course it is

"obsessed"

La-da-da-da, da-da-da (Da-da-da-da-da)
La-da-da-da-da

If I told you how much I think about her
You'd think I was in love
And if you knew how much I looked at her pictures
You would think we're best friends

'Cause I know her star sign, I know her blood type
I've seen every movie she's been in and, oh God, she's beautiful
And I know you love her and I know about her
But I can't help it, no, I can't help it

I'm so obsessed with your ex (Uh-huh)
I know she's been asleep on my side of your bed and I can feel it
I'm starin' at her like I wanna get hurt
And I remember every detail you would ever tell me, so be careful, baby
I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)
Yeah, I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)

La-da-da-da, da-da-da

She's got those lips, she's got those hips
The life of every fuckin' party
She's talented, she's good with kids
She even speaks kindly about me, ah-ah

And I know you love me and I know it's crazy
But every time you call my name, I think you mistake me for her
You both have moved on, you don't even talk
But I can't help it, I got issues, I can't help it, baby

I'm so obsessed with your ex
I know she's been asleep on my side in your bed and I can feel her
I'm starin' at her like I wanna get hurt
And I remember every detail you would ever tell me, so be careful, baby
I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)
Yeah, I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)

Is she friends with your friends Is she good in bed
Do you think about her No I'm fine, it doesn't matter, tell me
Is she easy-goin' Never controllin'
Well-traveled Well-read Oh God, she's makin' me so obsessed

I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)
She's been asleep on my side in your bed (Ah), woah
I'm so obsessed with your ex (Why'd she make me so obsessed Ah)
I'm so obsessed with your, with your ex

"scared of my guitar"

Perfect, easy, so good to me
So why's there a pit in my gut in the shape of you
Distract myself, say it's somethin' else
Maybe I'm just overwhelmed, maybe I'm confused

Barely sleep when you sleep next to me
But I keep thinkin' I'll find a cure
I say that I'm fine, I tell you all the time
I've never felt so happy and sure

But I'm so scared of my guitar
'Cause it cuts right through to the heart
Yeah, it knows me too well so I got no excuse
I can't lie to it the same way that I lie to you
I'm so scared of my guitar
If I play it, then I'll think too hard
Once you let the thought in, then it's already done
So I lay in your arms and pretend that it's love

I was ravin', no boy like you
I had the nerve to just stop stringin' you all along
But I'm not half as decent as you
I'd rather be tied to someone, even if they're wrong

I make excuses, my friends know the truth is
I'm not as alright as I claim
I say that I'm fine, I tell them all the time
As they watch all the life fade away

Yeah, I'm so scared of my guitar
'Cause it cuts right through to the heart
Yeah, it knows me too well so I got no excuse
I can't lie to it the same way that I lie to you
I'm so scared of my guitar
If I play it, then I'll think too hard
Once you let the thought in and then it's already done
So I lay in your arms and pretend that it's love
Yeah, I lay in your arms and pretend that it's love

I pretend that it's love
I pretend that it's love
I pretend that it's love, love

'Cause what if I never find anything better
The doubt always creeps through my mind
So we'll stay together 'cause how could I ever
Trade somethin' that's good for what's right

Oh, I'm so scared of my guitar
It cuts right through my heart
It knows me too well, I got no excuse
I can't lie to it the same way that I lie to you
I'm so scared of my guitar
When I play it is when I think too hard
I let the thought in, it's already done
But I lay in your arms and pretend that it's love
Yeah, I lay in your arms and pretend it's enough

"stranger"

I woke up this mornin' and I sat up straight in bed
I had the strangest feeling of this weight off in my chest
I hadn't felt that hopeful since the day that you left and it felt nice
So nice
And everybody told me it would happen in time
The fire would burn out and all the storm clouds would subside
And I always believed that it was some comforting lie that they believe it's nice
So nice

'Cause I was half myself without you and now I feel so complete
And I can't even remember what made me lose all my sleep
I cried a million rivers for you, but that's over now
You're just a stranger I know everything about, ooh, ooh
You're just a stranger I know everything about

Made a pot of coffee and I poured myself a cup
I thought of all the things I did to try and win your love
How did that happen I can't imagine ever doin' all that stuff for just one guy
Like, you're just some guy
Oh, but I hope that you're happy, babe, you know I really do
And God knows that I am the girl I am because of you
You know I'll always think of you, I'll love you 'til the end of time
You are the best thing that I'll ever keep so far out of my life

Yeah, I was half myself without you and now I feel so complete
I can't even remember what made me lose all my sleep
I cried a million rivers for you, but that's over now
You're just a stranger I know everything about, ooh, ooh
You're just a stranger I know everything about

There's nothin' left for me to know
I had to stay, you had to go
And it was me, but it doesn't matter anymore, no
There's nothin' left for me to sing
I screamed, I cried, I did the whole thing
And I loved you mad, but it doesn't matter anymore, no

I was half myself without you, but now I feel so complete
And if I'm not enough for you, you're not enough for me
I fought a million battles, but you can't get to me now
You're just a stranger I know everything about, ooh, ooh
You're just a stranger I know everything about
You're just a stranger I know everything about

"girl i've always been"

Five, six, five, six, seven, eight

"Baby doll, you have changed"
That's the thing you always say
Cursin' me, trash my name
I rained all over your parade
Now you're on my couch, you're fightin' tears
You say I'm cruel beyond my years
And as I'm walkin' out that door
Say you don't know me anymore

I have captors I call friends
I got panic rooms inside my head
I get down with crooked men
But I am the girl I've always been
I got a wrapped up in the game again
You woke up in an empty bed
And I can't say I'm a perfect ten
But I am the girl I've always been

Ah, mmm

So don't say that I've been acting different
I'm nothin' if I'm not consistent
You knew everything you'd be gettin'
I told you right from the beginnin'
Now you're on my case, how could I go
You never dreamed I'd be so cold
And then, with venom on your tongue
You ask who I have become

Well, I have captors I call friends
I got panic rooms inside my head
And I get down with the crooked men
But I am the girl I've always been
I got a wrapped up in the game again
You woke up in an empty bed
And I can't say I'm a perfect ten
But I am the girl I've always been

Yeah, I'm a candle in the wind
I'll turn you out, I'll turn you in
But I am the girl I've always been

"21st Century Girls"
(unreleased)

Long, blonde hair
Daddy's a millionaire
Nobody knows her
I mean everybody wants to
That's what I see

Europe trips
Kissing the dream boy's lips
Successful with a smile
She's everything I'll never be

21st century girls are perfect
And I know it isn't real, it sounds so stupid
But digital love, it still feels real to me
She looks like an angel, that's what they'll believe

21st century girls are flawless
And I say I didn't care, but if I am honest
It's hard not to feel like I'm never enough
Yeah, I want that 21st century love

"Apocalyptic Crush"
(unreleased)

Yeah, you must think you're funny calling him at ten o'clock
You think he thinks you're pretty, I can guarantee he does not
I know you see me, do you think that you can win this game

Yeah, you must think that you're so attractive when you're playing dumb
The only thing you're showing him is how desperate you've become
I hope you trip over the boundaries that you've stepped right over

But go ahead and shoot your shot, baby
Let me know how it goes
Know him better than you thought and I think you should know

You're his apocalyptic crush
He'd like you only if there was
No one left on earth
Babe, I'm sorry if that hurts
But he's mine until then

You're his apocalyptic crush
If we all died you'd be the one
Who'd get to kiss him in the ashes
So, hey, what are the chances of World War III
'Cause he's never gonna like you like he likes me

"Astronaut"

Ah (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Ah (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Ah (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Ah-ah (Ah, ah)

They say she's pretty
She comes from money
She gives you everything I couldn't give
You take her to the beach
You talk rationally
That's the kind of life I could never live

'Cause I'm an astronaut (Ah, ah)
I'm tethered to the stars (Ah, ah)
Yeah, I'm an astronaut (Ah, ah)
Who still thinks the world could be ours (Ah, ah)

When I sit here and watch you and her from outer space
I watch every part of me be replaced
And slowly, but surely
I drift away

They say you sing to her (Ah-ah)
She understands your humor (Ah-ah)
I'm glad you found yourself someone you can tie down (Ah, ah)
Oh-oh, let me ask you something small (Ah-ah)
Are you recycling it all (Ah-ah)
All of the sweet little words
And the perfect slow burns
I wonder if you told her I did that shit first (Ah)

Mmm, but I'm an astronaut (Ah)
Could never keep my feet on the ground (Ah, ah)
Yeah, I'm an astronaut (Ah, ah)
My dreams were too big to make you proud (Ah, ah)

So I sit here and watch you and her from outer space
I watch every part of me be replaced
And slowly, but surely
I drift away

You couldn't handle my lunacy, my voice, my opportunity
The distance and my confidence, no you couldn't put up with it
You left me stranded in the stars and ran into another's arms
Will you see me on the T.V. and be proud
Until then, just please do not forget about

Your little astronaut
Who's tethered to the stars
Your little astronaut
Who still thinks the world could be ours

Who's sittin' and watchin' you and her from outer space
I watch every part of me be replaced
And slowly, but surely, I'll
I'll be okay

Mmm, mmm (Ah, ah)
I'll be okay

"baby is you"
(unreleased)

I know you're with somebody new
But I can't write a song that's not all about you
It's not fair, baby
How come it's so easy
For you to forget everything you said
Like how I was the best girl that you'd ever met
Guess you take it back
Should've expected that

When I say I'm fine, I'm lyin' really well
'Cause I can't love anyone else
And I'm so jealous that you can
Scared I'll never feel that again
'Cause I still can't call anyone "Baby"
'Cause "Baby" is still you to me
Don't you think I wanna move on, too
But I can't love anyone the way, the way I loved you

"Can't Catch Me Now"
(from "The Hunger Games The Ballad Of Songbirds & Snakes" soundtrack)

There's blood on the side of the mountain
There's writing all over the wall
Shadows of us are still dancin'
In every room and every hall
There's snow fallin' over the city
You thought that it would wash away
The bitter taste of my fury
And all of the messes you made
Yeah, you think that you got away

But I'm in the trees, I'm in the breeze
My footsteps on the ground
You'll see my face in every place
But you can't catch me now
Through wading grass, the months will pass
You'll feel it all around
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere
But you can't catch me now
No, you can't catch me now

Bet you thought I'd never do it
Thought it'd go over my head
I bet you figured I'd pass with the winter
Be somethin' easy to forget
Oh, you think I'm gone 'cause I left

But I'm in the trees, I'm in the breeze
My footsteps on the ground
You'll see my face in every place
But you can't catch me now
Through wading grass, the months will pass
You'll feel it all around
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere
But you can't catch me now
No, you can't catch me now

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

You can't, you can't catch me now
I'm comin' like a storm into your town
You can't, you can't catch me now
I'm higher than the hopes that you brought down
You can't, you can't catch me now
I'm comin' like a storm into your town
You can't, you can't catch me now
I'm higher than the hopes that you brought down
You can't, you can't catch me now
I'm comin' like a storm into your town
You can't, you can't catch me now
You can't, you can't, you can't

There's blood on the side of the mountain
It's turning a new shade of red
Yeah, sometimes the fire you founded
Don't burn the way you'd expect
Yeah, you thought that this was the end

"Creature Of Habit"
(unreleased)

Planned out the conversation that we'll have when you see me
For the first time after these months of apathy
And you'll say that you want me back
And I'll say, "Babe, you don't mean that," ah-ah

'Cause I psychoanalyzed you better than your therapist
And I know that you don't love me
I know you just hate the risk of meeting someone else
Having to introduce yourself, ah-ah

You're not a hopeless romantic
You're just a creature of habit
You want me 'cause I'm easy
You want me 'cause you know me
I'm not your soulmate, babe, I swear
No, I'm just there, ah-ah, ah-ah
Oh, I'm just there, ooh-ooh

"Gross"
(unreleased)

Not long ago when I saw you there
With your brown eyed grin and your messy hair
And every girl at the party was looking at you (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I wonder what I'd say if I knew back then
That the brown eyed boy'd be my best friend
And the one I'd give my heart to (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Now everything reminds me of you
Your pictures framed all over my room
And if I hate someone, you'll hate 'em too

As long as I'm your darling angel
I don't need anything in the world
'Cause I feel like the luckiest every second that I'm your girl
I wanna do everything with you
Take the highs, I'll take the lows
I'll keep you close
Give you the most, oh, baby
I like you so much, it's kinda gross
Yeah, I like you so much, it's kinda gross

And driving in your car, I feel all grown up
Is it me or does it feel more than high school love
Not gonna lie, your last name sounds so ni-i-i-ce
I love when you complain about things like traffic
Love when you're tired, baby, I like all of it
Honestly, I can't believe you're mi-i-i-ine

I bring you up in every conversation
We're young, I know we gotta be patient
But I know I want my life to have you in it

Ooh, and as long as I'm your darling angel
I don't need anything in the world
'Cause I feel like the luckiest every second that I'm your girl
I wanna do everything with you
Take the highs, I'll take the lows
I'll keep you close
Give you the most, oh, baby
I like you so much, it's kinda gross
Yeah, I like you so much, it's kinda gross

"Just Because"
(unreleased)

I like the way you talk when you've just woken up
And I like the way we can joke about offensive stuff
I like the way you give homeless men your mittens
When you're all out of spare change
And I like the way you think, I like your reasoning
Everyone thinks you're brilliant, you think you don't know anything
I like the way you care, you're nice when no one's there
God, I hope you never change

'Cause people love to talk
And people always want something from you
'Cause that's what people do
But I don't want a thing
I think you're astounding
And I don't care what anyone says or what anyone does
'Cause, boy, I like you
And I like you just because

"L-O-V-E"
(unreleased)

A Monday morning you meet me at the hotel, and
You bought me coffee just to spill it on yourself
But you never take things seriously
It's kinda why I like you so much, honestly

And I wrote a note and left it folded in your pocket
You taped it to your wall in your New York apartment
Kissing in the taxi cab
'Til the driver gives us dirty looks back

Oh, it's L-O-V-E, or something like that
You're crazy, but it's not in a bad way
Dancing on the highway
You make me feel older than seventeen

Yeah, this is L-O-V-E, or something really close
Hey, baby, I think you're really dope
I honestly don't know why
I should ever leave your side
'Cause this is love, right

"Never Be Like Her"
(unreleased)

Blonde hair falls just above her shoulders
She's nineteen, but she looks a little older
With the prom queen smile, the cool vintage style
You're obsessed with her, and I don't blame you for it

But I'll never look like her
Not even if I tried
I'll never be cooler
Not even if I lied
Oh, she's whole where I am broken
She's great where I am good
And I'll never be like her
But you know I wish I could

"Pay Grade"
(unreleased)

You call me every night and tell me that you feel like shit
I say, "I'm sorry, is there any way I can help with it"
I listen to you scream, the world is simply your enemy
"With death and taxes, what's the point of tryna be happy"

And I've had bad days, bad years
Bad boys and bad careers
But I'm still standin' here
I understand you, darlin', but at the end of the day
You just won't help yourself
Rather give someone else
A glimpse into your hell
Pour all your problems on 'em just so you can walk away

Boy, I'm too young to be your mother
Not smart enough to be your therapist either
And I'm always here if you need a talk
But maybe first, you should take a walk
'Cause I'm not gonna make you change
That's above my pay grade, babe

"Pretender"
(unreleased)

What lies behind
Your pretty house with the white picket fence
And all the Barbies that you call your friends

Is your life a lie
Nothing's as good as it seems
And you're not the girl of their dreams

Oh, and maybe your life is all flowers
Maybe I'm insecure
Maybe you're good at taking pictures
Maybe you're a pretender, oh

Pretender, I'm pointing my finger at you
Pretender, if only they knew what I knew
Yeah, if only they knew what I knew

I'm happy with me
Think that's supposed to be enough
So why am I sulking, calling your bluff

Maybe your life is all flowers
Maybe I'm insecure
And maybe you're good at taking pictures
You're a pretender

Pretender, I'm pointing my finger at you
Pretender, if only they knew what I knew
Yeah, if only they knew what I knew

Pretender, I guess you're really not so bad
Maybe you pretend
But you look like you got the life I wish I had
I created you
To be plastic and deadly
I created you
To hide my own envy
To hide my own envy, yeah

Pretender, I wish I knew what you knew
Pretender, if only I was like you
Maybe I'm a pretender like you

"Prison For Life"

Just a boy in a Chevy truck
He's got money, but not too much
And he calls me, "Baby girl"
I run my hands through his curls
And my parents think he's good
And he is, but rest assured
He's anything but sweet
If someone comes for me

I'm a feminist obviously (Oh)
But I wouldn't really mind him saving me (Ah)
And I know that I'm fine without a man (Ah)
But I think I would like his protection (Ah)
I'm just being honest, can't change what I like
I'll never forget it, he told me one night
"If anybody hurts you, ha
I'm going to prison for life"

I'm no damsel in distress, no
But I like assertiveness, so
Wrap your arm around me, babe
And tell me that you'll keep me safe
I know it's bad to fantasize
About robbers and bad guys
But if you were there to save the day, ha
Think I'll let them in a merry way

I'm a feminist obviously (Oh)
But I wouldn't really mind him saving me (Ah)
And I know that I'm fine without a man (Ah)
But I think I would like his protection (Ah)
I'm just being honest, can't change what I like
I'll never forget it, he told me one night
"If anybody hurts you, ha
I'm going to prison for life"

(I) I know I can protect myself
(I) But when you do it for me, it's hot as hell
(I) You got my heart, you know me too well
(I) Think I'd even send you love letters in jail
(I)

I'm a feminist obviously (Oh)
But I wouldn't really mind him saving me (Saving me)
And I know that I'm fine without a man (A man)
But I think I would like his protection (Protection)
And God knows that I don't need no one
But pretending that I do is kind of fun (Kind of fun)
Yeah, I know that I'm fine without a man
But I think I'd like his protection (I'd like his protection)
I'm just being honest, can't change what I like
I'll never forget it, he told me one night (Night)
"If anybody hurts you, oh
I'm going to prison for life"

"Rebel Without A Clue"
(unreleased)

Sitting in my room
What's it all about
Feels like the world is gonna end
Before I figure her out

Drink up, my friend
My potion of emotion
Can you feel the love, the hate, the jealousy
The sheer confusion

'Cause I don't really know who I am
Or how to present that to you
I don't really know just who I am
I'm a rebel without a clue, oh

Let's sit, watch the trains all derail
They want me to learn
Well, they can sit and watch me fail
Are my friends changin'
Or is it in my mind
Will I ever shake hands with time

'Cause I don't really know who I am
Or how to present that to you
I don't really know just who I am
I'm a rebel without a clue, oh, no

I don't really know who I am
And now you want me to change
I don't really know what I am
Isn't everything just so strange

Sitting in my room
What's it all about Oh

"Strange"
(unreleased)

Oh no
Your voice through the phone
Tells me way more, than I ever wanted to know
You say, that you need your space
That letting me go
Was the hardest thing you could do cause
You're crazy for me, and I'm the best that you ever had

Oh no
It's kinda funny

Said it was raining but the suns out
Said you loved me, you're with her now
And I don't need you to explain
I'm just saying that it's strange
Said you couldn't live without me
Heard you're dancing at a party
And I don't wanna take her place
I'm just saying that it's strange

Strange, strange, strange
Strange, strange, strange

Oh no
I saw you and her
Out on the street
You were never that public with me
I know
That you met her when you were with me
I said I had doubts and you said I was crazy
Baby, was I crazy after all
Oh, oh, it's really funny

Said it was raining but the suns out
Said you loved me, you're with her now
And I don't need you to explain
I'm just saying that it's strange
Said you couldn't live without me
Heard you're dancing at a party
And I don't wanna take her place
I'm just saying that it's strange

Strange, strange, strange
Strange, strange, strange
I'm just saying that it's strange
Strange, strange, strange
Strange, strange, strange

Oh no, I guess I was right
Wish I was wrong
Me and my heart will be fine

Said it was raining but the suns out
Said you loved me, you're with her now
And I don't need you to explain
I'm just saying that it's strange
Said you couldn't live without me
Heard you're dancing at a party
And I don't wanna take her place
I'm just saying that it's strange

Strange, strange, strange
Strange, strange, strange
I'm just saying that it's strange
Strange, strange, strange
Strange, strange, strange

"The Ones I Love"

Sit in your car, wait in the dark
Radio is up and so is your guard
You don't know what to say
You're faking a smile, you say that you're fine
And maybe it'll all work out in time
You've always been good that way

Feel like I've done this before
You're fighting your tears as I open the door
And you deserve much more

Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
And I watch you cry, 'cause I wasn't enough
Watch you disappearing down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most

You told me your past
You hated your dad
And when you left college, couldn't wait to go back
'Cause you really trusted me
And what did I do What did I do
I built you up, abandoned you
And I'm too proud to say sorry

Feel like I've done this before
You're fighting your tears as I open the door
And you deserve much more

Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
And I watch you cry, 'cause I wasn't enough
Watch you disappearing down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most

I didn't mean it, baby
I didn't think it all through
I didn't mean it, baby
Always ruin good things like you
I watched the life drain out of your eyes
And it's no surprise
It's no surprise

Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
Now I watch you cry, 'cause I wasn't enough
I watch you disappearing down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
And I watch you cry, 'cause I wasn't enough
Watch you disappearing down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
The ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Ones I love the most

"Victim"
(unreleased)

I've been bad to boys I love
Maybe I'm selfish, maybe I'm young
And my guilty Catholic heart tears my guilty self apart on the floor
But I wish that you did something bad so we could settle the score

Let me be the victim of your perfect crime
Bathe in my blood so I'm not the bad guy
I messed up so maybe mess up too
Really want the blame to be on you
So, drive the knife in deep
Make the victim me

Then I'll hear the yells and see the red and blue
It'll be in the headlines, all our friends will hate you
I know I didn't deserve you, but now, it's vice versa
You'll finally see how it tastes
'Cause hurting the one that you swore you'd protect is the worst kind of heartbreak

So, let me be the victim of your perfect crime
I'll kill your conscience like you killed mine
Yeah, I messed up so maybe mess up, too
Really want the blame to be on you
So, drive the knife in deep
And make the victim me
Me, oh...

"White Flowers"
(unreleased)

White flowers and love letters
You say I'm yours forever
But it don't feel romantic, somehow

I'm pacing and I'm losing sleep
If you don't call, I start to weep
You're everything I cannot do without

I don't know who I would be
If I wasn't your baby
I built my life on your attention
On being an object of your affection

Now, crazy in love don't feel sweet
'Cause I'm with you but I miss me
Wish somebody had told me what I know now
Losing yourself in someone isn't Heaven, it's Hell

"Liquid Smooth"

I'm beautiful, I know 'cause it's the season
But what am I to do with all this beauty
Biology, I am an organism, I'm chemical
That's all, that is all

I'm liquid-smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid-smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall, capture me

Or at least take my picture

[Japanese "Kuzurete yuku mae ni"]
I'm pulsing, my blood is red and unafraid of living
Beginning to end

I'm liquid-smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid-smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall

How I feel this river rushing through my veins
With nowhere else to go, it circles 'round

I'm liquid-smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid-smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall, capture me

"Eric"

You like control, well, I do too
Take off my clothes and watch me move
You can come closer, I'll let you hurt me
How you choose

Help me with the zipper on my skirt, it's stuck
As you kneel, I'll be watching you fix me
This view of you, of the top of your head makes me forgive you

But how long, how long can we play this way
I'm tired, I'm tired of not loving you
My heart, my heart wants to hold you
But I know, I know, I know the rules

Blue light, dark room, the white of your teeth
As you smile at my trembling shoulders
But your skin, did you notice your skin
It cries a soft weep like mine

I'll sell, I'll sell my whole to you
What's my, what's my, what's my price
How 'bout, how 'bout just a part of you
'Cause I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want

"Brand New City"

One, two
Honey, what'd you take

Think my brain is rotting in places
I think my heart is ready to die
I think my body is falling in pieces
I think my blood is passing me by

Honey, what'd you take What'd you take
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take
Honey, what'd you take What'd you take
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take

I think my fate is losing its patience
I think the ground is pulling me down
I think my life is losing momentum
I think my ways are wearing me down

But if I gave up on being pretty, I wouldn't know how to be alive
I should move to a brand new city and teach myself how to die

Honey, what'd you take What'd you take
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take
Honey, what'd you take What'd you take
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take
Honey, what'd you take What'd you take
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take
Honey, what'd you take What'd you take
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take

"Real Men"

Real men don't need other people, and
Real men suck it in
Real men don't flinch or bleed in public
Oh, I think I'm a real man

Little boys cry and look around for comfort
And always get what they want
Little boys see toys and say, "I can take that"
Oh, you are my little boy

Though honestly, sir
All I wanna do is get naked in front of you
So you can look me up and down and tell me
"Well done, girl. You're looking good."

Real men keep cool in the face of a fire
Go down with the ship
And real men don't eat
'Cause they're above that, damn it
Oh, I'm gonna be a real man

Though honestly, sir
All I wanna do is get naked in front of you
So you can look me up and down
And give me your love for being so good

But little boys hold me, color me
Praise me, make me feel lovely
For a little while
So little boy, say you want me
'Cause, well, I can't take it
Go ahead
Do it, do it

"Wife"

You're home, you're home, you're home to me
So leave me, leave me, leave me a map
I'm here at my cliff looking down

I cannot bear you a son
But I will try
For if I am not yours, what am I
I daydream I'd give one a name of my own
For I, even I, even I am on loan

I have, I have, I watch a dream breaking
Breaking, breaking, breaking me
Away from my cliff, I am looking down from

I cannot bear you a son
I have tried
But if I am not yours, what am I
I daydream I'd give him a name of my own
For I, even mine, even mine is unknown

So let me go towards the morning star
With hope it won't disappear

"Bag Of Bones"

I'm all used up, pretty boy
Over and over again, my nail colors are wearing off
See my hands, pretty boy
What do they tell you
'Cause I've looked down at them, not knowing why
And after everything's done and I'm all undone
You can hear my high heels walking on
Clickety-clacking through the night
I'm carrying my bag of bones

Fluorescent store lights, you shine through the night
Illuminate my pores and you tear me apart
Mercy on me, would you please spare me tonight
I'm tired of this searching, would you let me let go

I know my room is a mess
Over and over again I tell myself I'll clean tomorrow
Just move the stuff up off the bed
And do what you came here to do
But first, open up a window for me
And let the cool air in, feel the night slip in
As it softly glides along your back
And I hope you leave right before the sun comes up
So I can watch it alone

Fluorescent store lights, you shine through the night
Illuminate my pores and you tear me apart
Mercy on me, would you please spare me tonight
I'm tired of this searching, would you let me let go

And I can take a little bit more
Let's shake this poet out of the beast
Just a, just a little bit more
Let's shake this poet out of the beast

"Door"

There is a door to me
I've never seen it
Sometimes I get closer to it
But I've never found it
At twilight, I almost had it
But then the night fell
I looked out at the dark and wondered
How could I have lost it

Then, one night, at the park I saw it
With my cheek in the dirt
I couldn't move underneath the dark
But at least I finally found it
Cried out a creak and opened
To show me what's beyond it
A hopeless violence
I named it "love"

"Pearl Diver"

Hmm
Hmm

Treasure hunter, you are dead
The light of the world is fading
You cannot see the other end
Your body's lost all feeling
Those creatures of your woken mind
Don't fear them or their hunger
Forgive the sea, follow the tide
With the monsters on your shoulder

Pearl diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver, dive, dive down
Pearl diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver, dive, dive down

Oh, hunter, if you didn't want
The beautiful so badly
Perhaps you would've found it
In your spirit singing softly
But hunter, you were human
Don't forget it and go safely
And I, I'll live without you
Though the struggle will be daily

Pearl diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver, dive, dive down
Pearl diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver, dive, dive down

Oh, oh
Oh, ooh

Treasure hunter, you are dead
The light of the world is fading

"Goodbye, My Danish Sweetheart"

There's nobody better than you
It took me a while 'til I knew
But you knew from the start it was us, didn't you
It just took me a while 'til I knew

Now I lay as I study a blank wall
Would you spare me your voice if I call
'Cause you waited and watered my heart 'til it grew
You just grew a little smarter too

So I don't blame you if you want to
Bury me in your memory, I'm not the girl I ought to be, but
Maybe when you tell your friends, you
Can tell them what you saw in me, and not how I turned out to be

There's some kind of burning inside me
It's kept me from falling apart
And I'm sure that you've seen what it's done to my heart
But it's kept me from falling apart

Now here I lay, as I wonder about you
Would you just tell me what I'm meant to do
'Cause I've waited and watered my heart 'til it grew
You can see how it's blossomed for you

And I don't blame you if you want to
Bury me in your memory, I'm not the girl I ought to be, but
Maybe when you tell your friends, you
Can tell them what you saw in me, and not the way I am

And I don't mean to make your heart blue
But could we be what we're meant to be
I'm just about to beg you please, and
Then when you tell your friends, you can
Tell them what you saw in me, and
Not the way I used to be

'Cause there's nobody better than you

"Shame"

It feels so good
It feels so good
And right outside the door nobody knows
They're right outside the door and they don't know how it
Feels so good
It feels so good

I never was very good
I haven't been so good
But right outside the door nobody knows
They're right outside the door and they don't know how it
Feels so good
It feels so good

And I don't need anything other than you

"Because Dreaming Costs Money, My Dear"

I can still smell the fire
Though I know it's long died out
The smoke still hangs in my hair
And on some quiet evenings it burns my eyes

So darling, play your violin
I know it's what you live for
Darling, play your violin
We will manage somehow

I once lived in the sea
Bring me to your ear, you can hear
The tide where I used to be
Though now I'm but a shell
Oh, baby
Don't say sorry

Darling, play your violin
I know it's what you live for
Darling, play your violin
We will manage somehow

Don't dare regret anything
Remember what you're here for
You just play your violin
We will manage somehow

"Humpty"

I'll live in the bathtub
It's cool and clean
It's smooth and it's steady
It's all that I need

I broke our belongings
They're all on the floor
The room is now empty
Nothing left to throw

All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But they crack and crumble, it's all too much
Too frail for me to touch

All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But they crack and crumble, it's all too much
Too frail for me to touch

I'll live in the bathtub
Surrounded by tiles
All so square and so steady
I will die in their cool, cool arms

I broke what you gave me
But you kept giving more
And I'm sorry for taking
But I keep wanting more, more, more

All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But they crack and crumble, it's all too much
Too frail for me to touch

All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But, Humpty Dumpty, you're much too much
Too frail for me to touch

Humpty Dumpty
It's much too much

All the eggshells are on the ground

"Circle"

There's a lie that I told to you
That now I can't tell the truth
And it ate me inside, so one soft drunken night
I slept with a man you knew

And in the morning I walked home alone
And the businessmen saw my bones
With my skirt in their eyes, they remembered the nights
When they were that man you knew

You told me once
You were happy to have me
But I never gave me away

There's the lie that I told to you

I would give you my heart, I think
But it's up in a branch of a tree
It was only to tease when he climbed up the tree
Put my heart where I couldn't reach

I didn't mind, I adored him so
We forgot, and we left for home
And that was so long ago, now the tree it has grown

And nobody knows my lover is buried underground
Nobody knows my lover is buried underground
Nobody knows my lover is buried underground

There's a lie that I told to you

"I Want You"

I want you
I hold one card
That I can't use
But I want you

You're coming back
And it's the end of the world
We're starting over
And I love you darling
And I am done, dear

You're in the house
And I am here in the car
I just need a quiet place
Where I can scream
How I love you

I found you
I found the door
But when I stepped through
There was no floor

You're coming back
And it's the end of the world
We're starting over
And I love you darling
And I am done, dear

You're in the house
And I am here in the car
I just need a quiet place
Where I can scream
How I love you

I want you
I want you

"Square"

Your room was square
I once noticed from there
In your bed, as you slept
And I held my breath
Everything had its own place
And I wondered what space would I take
In the order you kept

I tried to eat like your girlfriend
Just tea in the night, I'd end up
Too hungry to sleep
So lying awake, I would follow the aching inside
I would find
It's for you won't be mine

I tried my hardest, for I'd never learned
God's very simple and love shouldn't burn
And I would've offered you all that you yearned for
But I was still waiting for something to earn

What is that quiet of snow in the night
The dark rings with white noise
As you stand and drown
Maybe it's all of these snowflakes, screaming
A choir of mute
As they brace for the ground

Well, that's my ride
Hope you had a good night
You know, you made me happy
Here, shake my hand
You make such a good man
Never once did you know me

I tried my hardest, for how do you learn
God's very simple and love doesn't burn
And maybe you'd offered me all that I yearned for
But I was still waiting for something to earn

Silly me, waiting

"Strawberry Blond"

I love everybody
Because I love you
When you stood up
Walked away, barefoot
And the grass where you lay
Left a bed in your shape
I looked over it
And I ached

I love everybody
Because I love you
I don't need the city, and I
Don't need proof
All I need, darling
Is a life in your shape
I picture it, soft
And I ache

Look at you, strawberry blond

Reach out the car window
Trying to hold the wind
You tell me you love her
I give you a grin
Oh all I ever wanted was a
Life in your shape
So I follow the white lines
Follow the white lines
Keep my eyes on the road
As I ache

Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way

Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way

Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way

Isaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah

"Class Of 2013"

Mom, I'm tired
Can I sleep in your house tonight
Mom, is it alright
If I stay for a year or two
Mom, I'll be quiet
It would be just to sleep at night
And I'll leave once I figure out
How to pay for my own life too

Mom, would you wash my back
This once, and then we can forget
And I'll leave what I'm chasing
For the other girls to pursue

Mom, am I still young
Can I dream for a few months more

"Texas Reznikoff"

It's beautiful out today
I wish you could take me upstate
To the little place you would tell me about
When you'd sense that I'd want to escape

Texas is a land-locked state
It's a little bit far away
From the water, from the home that I've wanted to make
It somehow, in the city, you make it there and you make it
Anywhere, anywhere
But I've been anywhere and it's not what I want
I wanna be still with you

You keep your socks on in bed
Keep our hearth warm
"See the trees' shadows lie in black pools in the lawns"
You're the breeze in my Austin nights
You're the breeze in my Austin nights
You're the breeze in my Austin nights

"Townie"

There's a party and we're all going
And we're all growing up
Somebody's driving and he will be drinking
And no one's going back
'Cause we've tried hungry and we've tried full and
Nothing seems enough
So tonight, tonight
The boys are gonna go for
More more more

And I want a love that falls as fast
As a body from the balcony, and
I want to kiss like my heart is hitting the ground
I'm holding my breath with a baseball bat
Though I don't know what I'm waiting for
I am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be

Smell that, it's wet grass, and smoke in my hair
I think I've had enough
But he wants a finale and I came prepared
And we're not going back
And I've tried sharing and I've tried caring
And I've tried putting out
But the boys, boys, boys keep coming on for
More more more
And change, change, change is gonna come, but
When, when, when

And I want a love that falls as fast
As a body from the balcony, and
I want to kiss like my heart is chasing me down
I'm holding my breath with a baseball bat
Though I don't know what I'm waiting for
I am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be

And I want a love that falls as fast
As a body from the balcony, and
I want to kiss like my heart is hitting the ground
I'm holding my breath with a baseball bat
Though I don't know what I'm waiting for
I am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be

I'm not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be
I wanna be what my body wants me to be

"First Love  Late Spring"

The black hole of the window where you sleep
The night breeze carries something sweet, a peach tree
Wild women don't get the blues
But I find that lately, I've been crying like a tall child

So please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me
Mune ga hachikire-sde
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me, "Don't," so I can crawl back in

And I was so young when I behaved twenty-five
Yet now, I find I've grown into a tall child
And I don't wanna go home yet
Let me walk to the top of the big night sky

Please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me
Mune ga hachikire-sde
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me, "Don't," so I can crawl back in

One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me, "Don't," so I can crawl back in
Please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe

"Francis Forever"

I don't know what to do without you
I don't know where to put my hands
I've been trying to lay my head down
But I'm writing this at 3 AM

I don't need the world to see
That I've been the best I can be, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me

On sunny days, I go out walking
I end up on a tree-lined street
I look up at the gaps of sunlight
I miss you more than anything

I don't need the world to see
That I've been the best I can be, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me

And autumn comes when you're not yet done
With the summer passing by, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me

"I Don't Smoke"

I don't smoke
Except for when I'm missing you
To remember your mouth, how it
Tasted true
And I don't smoke
Except for after I've held you, baby
Being with you
Makes the flame burn good

So if you need to be mean
Be mean to me
I can take it and put it inside of me
If your hands need to break
More than trinkets in your room
You can lean on my arm
As you break my heart

I'm what's left of when we
Swam under the moon
Now the rest of my days are just
Waiting for when
You've calmed down and tell me
I was meant for you, baby
Being with you
Makes the flame burn good

If you need to be mean
Be mean to me
I can take it and put it inside of me
If your hands need to break
More than trinkets in your room
You can lean on my arm
As you break my heart

Just don't leave me alone
Wondering where you are
I am stronger than you give me
Credit for

If your hands need to break
More than trinkets in your room
You can lean on my arm
As you break my heart

"Jobless Monday"

It's a windy afternoon
Can't afford to buy my food
Or the drive I need to go
Further than they said I'd go

He only loves me when
There's a means he means to end
Oh I miss when we first met
He didn't know me yet

So take me out baby
Makes no difference where we'll be
As long as we're out in the sun
Take me out baby

Take me out baby
Doesn't matter where we'll be
But please under the light of day
Take me out
Take me out
Take me out baby
Take me out to

"Drunk Walk Home"

I will retire to the Salton Sea
At the age of 23
For I'm starting to learn I may never be free
But though I may never be free
Fuck you and your money
I'm tired of your money

And I sit on the curb 'cause it's the prettiest night
With no one else in sight
You know I wore this dress for you
These killer heels for you
See the dark, it moves
With every breath of the breeze

"I Will"

I will take good care of you
I will take good care of you
Everything you feel is good
If you would only let you
I will wash your hair at night
And dry it off with care
I will see your body bare
And still I will live here

So stay with me
Hold my hand
There's no need
To be brave

And all the quiet nights you bear
Seal them up with care
No one needs to know they're there
For I will hold them for you

'Cause all I ever wanted is here
All I ever wanted
All I want is
Always you
It's always you

And we're not out of the tunnel
I bet you, though, there's an end

Stay with me
Hold my hand
There's no need
To be brave

And while you sleep
I'll be scared
So by the time you wake
I'll be brave
I'll be brave
I'll be brave

"Carry Me Out"

At night
On the roof top
I untie my hair
And watch from my plastic chair
As my dark hair
Unleashes the night

The scent of flowers
Still in bloom from morning shower
And I
Say your name
In hopes you'll hear it in the stars

And carry me out
Carry me out

I drive when it rains
At night, when it rains, I drive
And the headlight spirits
They lead me down the Styx
So black it shines

And carry me out
Carry me out

At night
On the roof top
I untie my hair
And watch from my plastic chair
As my dark hair
Unleashes the night

"Last Words Of A Shooting Star"

All of this turbulence wasn't forecasted
Apologies from the intercom
And I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
They'll think of me kindly
When they come for my things
They'll never know how I'd stared at the dark in that room
With no thoughts
Like a blood-sniffing shark
And while my dreams made music in the night
Carefully
I was going to live

You wouldn't leave 'til we loved in the morning
You'd learned from movies how love ought to be
And you'd say you love me and look in my eyes
But I know through mine you were
Looking in yours
And did you know the Liberty Bell is a replica
Silently housed in its original walls
And while its dreams played music in the night
Quietly
It was told to believe

I always wanted to die clean and pretty
But I'd be too busy on working days
So I am relieved that the turbulence wasn't forecasted
I couldn't have changed anyways

I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
Goodbye

"Happy"

Happy came to visit me, he bought cookies on the way
I poured him tea, and he told me, "It'll all be okay"
Well, I told him I'd do anything to have him stay with me
So he laid me down, and I felt happy, come inside of me
He laid me down, and I felt happy

Oh, if you're going, take the train
So I can hear it rumble, one last rumble
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you

I was in the bathroom, I didn't hear him leave
I locked the door behind him, and I turned around to see
All the cookie wrappers and the empty cups of tea
Well, I sighed and mumbled to myself, "Again, I have to clean"
I sighed and mumbled to myself

If you're going, take the train
So I can hear it rumble, one last rumble
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you
And if you're going, take the moon
Then maybe I will see you, in the night I'll see you
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you

"Dan The Dancer"

Dan had very long limbs
From leading day to day
Hanging onto a cliff
That stretched him everyday
And when she'd ask to hold hands
He would smile and
Let one of his hands go
His whole life in one hand
His whole life

When he'd say goodnight and
Leave her doorstep
He'd use his last strength
To wave back
And once back in his room
Once back in his room
He'd return his waving hand
Back to its cliff
He liked her more than life itself
I'm sure

'Cause Dan had never danced outside of his room
When no one was home and he would stop to hear the door
So when he moved with you
And felt his body let go
Of course you couldn't know
It was you and you alone
That he had shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
And he would never tell you that it was his first time

"Once More To See You"

In the rear-view mirror
I saw the setting sun on your neck
And felt the taste of you bubble up inside me
But with everybody watching us
Our every move
We do have reputations
We keep it secret
Won't let them have it

So come inside and be with me
Alone with me
Alone
With me alone
If you would let me give you pinky-promise kisses
Then I wouldn't have to scream your name atop of every roof in the city of my heart
If I could see you
Once more to see you

Come inside and be with me
Alone with me
Alone
With me alone
If you would let me give you pinky-promise kisses
Then I wouldn't have to scream your name atop of every roof in the city of my heart
If I could see you
Once more to see you
If I could see you
Once more to see you

"Fireworks"

One morning, this sadness will fossilize
And I will forget how to cry
I'll keep going to work, and you won't see a change
Save, perhaps, a slight gray in my eye

I will go jogging routinely
Calmly and rhythmically run
And when I find that a knife's sticking out of my side
I'll pull it out without questioning why

And then, one warm summer night
I'll hear fireworks outside
And I'll listen to the memories as they cry, cry, cry

I will be married to silence
The gentleman won't say a word
But you know, oh, you know in the quiet he holds
Runs a river that will never find home

And then, one warm summer night
I'll hear fireworks outside
And I'll listen to the memories as they cry, cry, cry
Oh, one warm summer night
I'll hear fireworks outside
And I'll listen to the memories as they cry, cry, cry

Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry

"Your Best American Girl"

If I could, I'd be your little spoon
And kiss your fingers forevermore
But, big spoon, you have so much to do
And I have nothing ahead of me
You're the sun, you've never seen the night
But you hear its song from the morning birds
Well, I'm not the moon, I'm not even a star
But awake at night I'll be singing to the birds

Don't wait for me, I can't come

Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do, I think I do
And you're an all-American boy
I guess I couldn't help trying to be your best American girl

You're the one
You're all I ever wanted
I think I'll regret this

Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do, I finally do
And you're an all-American boy
I guess I couldn't help trying to be the best American girl
Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do, I think I do

"I Bet On Losing Dogs"

My baby, my baby
You're my baby, say it to me
Baby, my baby
Tell your baby that I'm your baby

I bet on losing dogs
I know they're losing and I pay for my place
By the ring
Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down
I'll be there on their side
I'm losing by their side

Will you let me, baby
Lose on losing dogs
I know they're losing and I pay for my place
By the ring
Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down

I wanna feel it
I bet on losing dogs
I always want you when I'm finally fine
How you'd be over me looking in my eyes when I come
Someone to watch me die
Someone to watch me die
I bet on losing dogs

Did you get that

"My Body's Made Of Crushed Little Stars"

I'm not doing anything
I'm not doing anything
My body's made of crushed little stars
And I'm not doing anything
I wanna see the whole world
I wanna see the whole world
I don't know how I'm gonna pay rent
I wanna see the whole world

Would you kill me, Jerusalem
Kill me, Jerusalem
Kill me, Jerusalem
Come find me

I better ace that interview
I better ace that interview
I should tell them that I'm not afraid to die
I better ace that interview

Uh
I work better under a deadline
I work better under a deadline
I pick an age when I'm gonna disappear
Until then I can try again
Until then I can try again

Kill me, Jerusalem
Kill me, Jerusalem
Kill me, Jerusalem
Go and kill me

"Thursday Girl"

Glory, glory, glory to the night that shows me what I am
As I go to the party on my knees
Saying, "Take it all, please..."

And tell me no
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Somebody, please
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Tell me no

Glory, glory, glory to the night
It shows me what I am (Glory)
I'm not happy or sad, just up or down
And always bad

Tell me no
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Somebody, please
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Tell me no
Somebody here
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Tell me no

"A Loving Feeling"

What do you do with a loving feeling
If the loving feeling makes you all alone
What do you do with a loving feeling
If they only love you when you're all alone

Holding hands under the table
Meeting up in your bedroom
Making love to other people
Telling each other it's all good
Kisses like pink cotton candy
Talking to everyone but me
I'm staying up late just in case you come up and ask to leave with me

What do you do with a loving feeling
If the loving feeling makes you all alone
What do you do with a loving feeling
If they only love you when you're all alone
What do you do with a loving feeling
If the loving feeling makes you all alone
What do you do with a loving feeling
If they only love you when you're all alone

You only love me when we're all alone

"Crack Baby"

Down empty streets sniffing glue, me and you
Blank, open eyes watch the moonflower bloom
It's been a long, hard, twenty-year summer vacation
All these twenty years trying to fill the void

Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you had it once
And you know that you want it back
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you're needing it
And you know that you need it bad

With wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones

Went to your room thinking, maybe, you'll feel something
But all I saw was your burning body waiting
All these twenty years on a vacation

Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you had it once
And you know that you want it back
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you're needing it
And you know that you need it bad
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you want it
Yeah, you know that you want it
You know that you
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you need it
And you know that you need it bad

With wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones

"A Burning Hill"

Today, I will wear my white button-down
I'm tired of wanting more
I think I'm finally worn
For you have a way of promising things
And I've been a forest fire
I am a forest fire
And I am the fire, and I am the forest
And I am a witness watching it
I stand in a valley watching it
And you are not there at all

So today, I will wear my white button-down
I can at least be neat
Walk out and be seen as clean
And I'll go to work, and I'll go to sleep
And I'll love the littler things
I'll love some littler things

"Geyser"

You're my number one
You're the one I want
And I've turned down
Every hand that has beckoned me to come
You're my number one
You're the one I want
And I've turned down
Every hand that has beckoned me to come

'Cause you're the one I got
You're the one I got
So I'll keep turning down the hands
That beckon me to come

Though I'm a geyser, feel it bubbling from below
Hear it call, hear it call, hear it call to me, constantly
And hear the harmony only when it's harming me
It's not real, it's not real, it's not real enough

But I will be the one you need
The way I can't be without you
I will be the one you need
I just can't be without you

"Why Didn't You Stop Me"

I know that I ended it, but
Why won't you chase after me
You know me better than I do
So why didn't you stop me

Why didn't you stop me
Why didn't you stop me
And paint it over

I look for a picture of you
To keep in my pocket
But I can't seem to find one
Where you look how I remember

Look how I remember
Look how I remember
Paint it over

"Old Friend"

We nearly drowned
For such a silly thing
Someone who loves me now
Better than you
And that pretty friend is
Finally yours, and
I'll be around on Sunday, if

You'll meet me at Blue Diner
I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take anything you wanna give me, baby

I haven't told anyone
Just like we promised
Have you
Every time I drive through the city where you're from
I squeeze a little

Meet me at Blue Diner
I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take anything you wanna give me, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby
Blue Diner, I'll take anything you wanna give me, baby

"A Pearl"

You're growing tired of me
You love me so hard and I still can't sleep
You're growing tired of me
And all the things I don't talk about

Sorry, I don't want your touch
It's not that I don't want you
Sorry, I can't take your touch

It's just that I fell in love with a war
Nobody told me it ended
And it left a pearl in my head
And I roll it around
Every night, just to watch it glow
Every night, baby, that's where I go

Sorry, I don't want your touch
It's not that I don't want you
Sorry, I can't take your touch

There's a hole that you fill
You fill, you fill

But it's just that I fell in love with a war
And nobody told me it ended
And it left a pearl in my head
And I roll it around
Every night, just to watch it glow
Every night, baby, that's where I go
Just to watch it glow

"Lonesome Love"

I call you, to see you again
So I can win, and this can finally end
Spend an hour on my makeup
To prove something

Walk up in my high heels
All high and mighty
And you say, "Hello"
And I lose

'Cause nobody butters me up like you, and
Nobody fucks me like me

In the morning, in a taxi
I'm so very paying for
Why am I lonely for lonesome love
Why am I lonely for lonesome love
Why am I lonely

"Remember My Name"

I gave too much of my heart tonight
Can you come to where I'm staying and make some extra love
That I can save 'til tomorrow's show

'Cause I need somebody to remember my name
After all that I can do for them is done
I need someone to remember me

I need something bigger than the sky
Hold it in my arms and know it's mine
Just how many stars will I need to hang around me
To finally call it heaven

I need somebody to remember my name
After all that I can do for them is done
I need someone to remember me

I need something bigger than the sky
Hold it in my arms and know it's mine
Just how many stars will I need to hang around me
To finally get somewhere I can be all done
Somewhere like heaven

"Me And My Husband"

I steal a few breaths from the world for a minute
And then I'll be nothing forever
And all of my memories
And all of the things I have seen will be gone
With my eyes, with my body, with me

But me and my husband
We are doing better
It's always been just him and me
Together
So I bet all I have on that
Furrowed brow
And at least in this lifetime
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We're sticking together

And I'm the idiot with the painted face
In the corner, taking up space
But when he walks in, I am loved, I am loved

Me and my husband
We are doing better
It's always been just him and me
Together
So I bet all I have on that
Furrowed brow
And at least in this lifetime
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We are doing better

"Come Into The Water"

Come into the water
Do you wanna be my baby
Are you waiting to touch me
You look so good, but I keep my hands
'Til you come into the water

Maybe I'm the same as all those men
Writing songs of all they're dreaming
But would you tell me if you want me
'Cause I can't move until you show me

I didn't know I had a dream
I didn't know until I saw you
So would you tell me if you want me
'Cause I can't move until you show me

"Nobody"

My God, I'm so lonely
So I open the window
To hear sounds of people
To hear sounds of people

Venus, planet of love
Was destroyed by global warming
Did its people want too much too
Did its people want too much

And I don't want your pity
I just want somebody near me
Guess I'm a coward
I just want to feel alright

And I know no one will save me
I just need someone to kiss
Give me one good honest kiss
And I'll be alright

Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody, nobody

I've been big and small and
Big and small and
Big and small again
And still nobody wants me
Still nobody wants me

And I know no one will save me
I'm just asking for a kiss
Give me one good movie kiss
And I'll be alright

Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, no

"Pink In The Night"

I glow pink in the night in my room
I've been blossoming alone over you
And I hear my heart breaking tonight
I hear my heart breaking tonight
Do you hear it too
It's like a summer shower
With every drop of rain singing
"I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you"

I could stare at your back all day
I could stare at your back all day
And I know I've kissed you before, but
I didn't do it right
Can I try again, try again, try again
Try again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again

"A Horse Named Cold Air"

A lake with no fish
Is the heart of a horse
Named Cold Air
Who, when young
Would run like a storm
They would say

I thought I'd traveled a long way
But I had circled
The same old sin

"Washing Machine Heart"

Toss your dirty shoes in my washing-machine heart
Baby, bang it up inside
I'm not wearing my usual lipstick
I thought maybe we would kiss tonight
Baby, will you kiss me already, and
Toss your dirty shoes in my washing-machine heart
Baby, bang it up inside

Baby, though I've closed my eyes
I know who you pretend I am
I know who you pretend I am

But do mi ti
Why not me
Why not me
Do mi ti
Why not me
Why not me
Do mi ti
Why not me
Why not me

"Blue Light"

Somebody kiss me, I'm going crazy
I'm walking 'round the house naked
Silver in the night
Singing, "Do-do, do-do..."

Out there I'm a sharp knife
Are you that blue light
Are you that blue light
Are you that blue light
Are you

"Do-do, do-do..."

"Two Slow Dancers"

Does it smell like a school gymnasium in here
It's funny how they're all the same
It's funny how you always remember
And we've both done it all a hundred times before
It's funny how I still forgot

It would be a hundred times easier
If we were young again
But as it is
And it is
We're just two slow dancers, last ones out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out

And the ground has been slowly pulling us back down
You see it on both our skin
We get a few years and then it wants us back

It would be a hundred times easier
If we were young again
But as it is
And it is
To think that we could stay the same
To think that we could stay the same
To think that we could stay the same
But we're two slow dancers, last ones out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out
Two slow dancers, last ones out

"Valentine, Texas"

Let's step carefully into the dark
Once we're in, I'll remember my way around
Who will I be tonight
Who will I become tonight
I'll show you who my sweetheart's never met
Wet teeth, shining eyes
Glimmering by a fire

Let's drive out to where dust devils are made
By dancing ghosts as they kick up clouds of sand
Where clouds look like mountains
Clouds look like mountains
Let me watch those mountains from underneath
And maybe they'll finally float off of me

"Working For The Knife"

I cry at the start of every movie
I guess 'cause I wish I was making things too
But I'm working for the knife

I used to think I would tell stories
But nobody cared for the stories I had about
No good guys

I always knew the world moves on
I just didn't know it would go without me
I start the day high and it ends so low
'Cause I'm working for the knife

I used to think I'd be done by 20
Now at 29 the road ahead appears the same
Though maybe at 30 I'll see a way to change
That I'm living for the knife

I always thought the choice was mine
And I was right but I just chose wrong
I start the day lying and end with the truth
That I'm dying for the knife

"Stay Soft"

Fury, pure and silver
You grip it tight inside
Like a knife
It glints in your eye

It's why I've arrived, your sex god
Here to take you where
You need to go
To where the dark remembers you

Open up your heart
Like the gates of hell

You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up

I am face down on my bed
Still not quite awake yet
Thinking of you
I tuck my hand under my weight

Just tell me what you want to do
Tell me what you want
To burn away
'Cause I could be your stoker

Open up your heart
Like the gates of hell

You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up

You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up

Only natural to harden up

"Everyone"

Everyone, all of them
Everyone said don't go that way
So, of course, to that I said
I think I'll go that way

And I left the door open to the dark
I said come in, come in, whatever you are
But it didn't want me yet

Then like a babe in a crib
After some big hand turns out the light
And I opened my arms wide to the dark
I said take it all, whatever you want
I didn't know that I was young
I didn't know what it would take
I didn't know what it would take

Sometimes I think I am free
Until I find I'm back in line again

"Heat Lightning"

Heat lightning
Running outside the window
I've laid awake since 100 and, now, it's 4 o'clock
Though I've held on
Can't carry it much longer
On the ceiling dancing are the things all come and gone

And there's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
So, I give it up to you
I hope that's okay
There's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
I give it up to you
I surrender

Heat lightning
Watch it from my doorstep
Sleeping eyelid of the sky
Flutters in a dream
Well I've held on
But feel a storm approaching
Trees are swaying in the wind like sea anemones

And there's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
Can I give it up to you
Would that be okay
There's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
I give it up to you
I surrender

There's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
I give it up to you
I surrender

"The Only Heartbreaker"

If you would just make one mistake
What a relief that would be
But I think for as long as we're together
I'll be the only heartbreaker

I'll be the only heartbreaker
I'll be the only heartbreaker

So I'll be the loser in this game
I'll be the bad guy in the play
I'll be the water main that's burst and flooding
You'll be by the window, only watching

I'll be the only heartbreaker
I'll be the only heartbreaker

(I apologize)
(You forgive me)
(I apologize)
(You forgive me)

And make me the only heartbreaker
So I'll be the only heartbreaker

"Love Me More"

If I keep myself at home
I won't make the same mistake
That I made for fifteen years
I could be a new girl
I will be a new girl

I wish that this would go away
But when I'm done singing this song
I will have to find something else
To do to keep me here
Something else to keep me here

Here's my hand
There's the itch
But I'm not supposed to scratch

I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to fill me up
Fill me up, fill me full up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to drown it out
Drown it out, drown me out

How do other people live
I wonder how they keep it up
When today is finally done
There's another day to come
Then another day to come
Then another day to

Come back to mine
We'll pretend it ends tomorrow

I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to fill me up
Fill me up, fill me full up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to drown it out
Drown it out, drown me out

I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to clean me up
Clean me up, clean me up
Clean me up, clean me up
Clean me up, clean me up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more

"There's Nothing Left Here For You"

There's nothing left for you
Nothing in this room
Try and go outside
Nothing waits for you

You had it once before
Not anymore
So go on to that sweetheart's door
And find a new you

Give her all the love
You saved for it

You could touch fire
You could fly
It was your right
It was your life

And then it passed
To someone new
It'll keep passing on
Long after you

But you're the only one
She's counting on

There's nothing left for you

"Should've Been Me"

Well I went through my list of friends and found
I had no one to tell
Of this overwhelming clean feeling
Strange serenity

When I saw the girl looked just like me
And it broke my heart, the lengths you went
To hold me
To get to have me, 'cause

I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
So you went into your memory
Relived all the ways you still want me
I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
I'm sorry it should've been me

I'd be going 'bout my day until a hand
Would come and lift me out
And drop me in the middle of a labyrinth
Where I'd be stuck a while

When I saw the girl looked just like me, I thought
Must be lonely loving someone
Trying to find their way out of a maze
Oh I know

I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
So you went into your memory
Relived all the ways you still want me
I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
I'm sorry it should've been me
I'm sorry it should've been me

"I Guess"

I guess, I guess
I guess this is the end
I'll have to learn
To be somebody else

It's been you and me
Since before I was me
Without you I don't yet know
Quite how to live

If I could keep
Anything of you
I would keep
Just this quiet after you

It's still as a pond
I am staring into
From here I can say
Thank you
From here I can tell you
Thank you

"That's Our Lamp"

We fought again
I ran out the apartment
You say you love me
I believe you do
But I walk down and up and down
And up and down this street
'Cause you just don't like me
Not like you used to

That's our lamp
It shines like a big moon
We may be ending
I'm standing in the dark
Looking up into our room
Where you'll be waiting for me
Thinking that's where you loved me
That's where you loved me

Thinking that's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me

"Glide (Lily Chou-Chou)"

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like a melody
Just like a simple sound
Like in harmony

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like the sky
Just fly so far away
To another place

To be away from all
To be one
Of everything

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like the wind
Just flowing in the air
Through an open space

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like the sea
Just swaying in the water
So to be at ease

To be away from all
To be one
Of everything

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like a melody
Just like a simple sound
Like in harmony

"Bug Like An Angel"

There's a bug like an angel
Stuck to the bottom
Of my glass, with a little bit left
As I got older
I learned I'm a drinker
Sometimes a drink feels like family
Family

Hey, what's the matter
Lookin' like your sticker
Is stuck on a floor somewhere
Did you go and make promises you can't keep
Well, when you break them
They break you right back
Amateur mistake
You can take it from me
They break you right back
Break you right back

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

When I'm bent over
Wishin' it was over
Makin' all variety of vows I'll never keep
I try to remember
The wrath of the devil
Was also given him by God
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

"Buffalo Replaced"

Mosquitoes can enjoy me, I can't go inside
I'm suckin' up as much of the full moon, so bright
Fireflies zoomin' through the yard like highway cars
Someone out here burnin' something, kids feelin' alive

Freight train stampedin' through my backyard
It'll run across the plains like the new buffalo replaced

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I have a hope and though she's blind with no name
She shits where she's supposed to, feeds herself while I'm away
Sometimes I think it would be easier without her
But I know nothing can hurt me when I see her sleepin' face

Freight train horn howlin' out mad and wild
Headin' somewhere far away like the new buffalo replaced

Oooh, ahhh
Ooh, ooh

"Heaven"

All of our love
Fillin' all of our room
Your low warm voice
Curses as you find the string
To strike within me
That rings out a note
Heard in heaven

Heaven
Heaven

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Now I bend like a willow
Thinkin' of you
Like a murmurin' brook
Curvin' about you
As I sip on the rest of the coffee you left
A kiss left of you

Heaven
Heaven
Heaven

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Hear the storm
Dances outside
Something set free
Is runnin' through the night
And the dark awaits us
All around the corner
But here in our place
We have for the day
Can we stay awhile and listen for

Heaven
Heaven

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

"I Don't Like My Mind"

I don't like my mind, I don't like being left alone in a room
With all its opinions about the things that I've done
So, yeah, I blast music loud, and I work myself to the bone
And on an inconvenient Christmas, I eat a cake

A whole cake, all for me
Ooh, aah

And then I get sick and throw up and there's another memory that gets stuck
Inside the walls of my skull waiting for its turn to talk
And it may be a few years, but you can bet it's there, waiting still
For me to be left alone in a room full of things that I've done

A whole cake, so please don't take
Take this job from me
A whole cake, so please don't take
Take my job from me

"The Deal"

There's a deal you can make on a midnight walk alone
Look around, listen close, hear it fall from above
It will ask what you'd give and what you'd take for it in return
I once went on such walk and I found that I'd said

I want someone to take this soul
I can't bear to keep it
I'd give it just to give
And all I will take are the consequences
Will somebody take this soul

Then, of course, nothing replied, nothing speaks to you in the night
And I walked my way home, there was no one in sight
Save a bird perched upon a streetlight, watchin' me
So, I stopped and let it watch 'til I found that it said

Now I'm taken, the night has me
You won't hear me singin'
You're a cage without me
Your pain is eased but you'll never be free, for
Now I'm taken, the night has me

There's a deal that I made
There's a deal that I made
There's a deal that I made
There's a deal

"When Memories Snow"

When memories snow
And cover up the driveway
I shovel all those memories
Clear the path to drive to the store
And when memories melt
I hear them in the drainpipe
Drippin' through the downspout
As I lie awake in the dark

And if I break
Could I go on break
Be back in my room
Writin' speeches in my head
Listenin' to the thousand hands
That clap for me in the dark

"My Love Mine All Mine"

Moon, a hole of light
Through the big top tent up high
Here before and after me
Shinin' down on me
Moon, tell me if I could
Send up my heart to you
So, when I die, which I must do
Could it shine down here with you

'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine

My baby here on earth
Showed me what my heart was worth
So, when it comes to be my turn
Could you shine it down here for her

'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine
Nothing in the world is mine for free
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine

"The Frost"

The frost, it looks like dust
Settled on the world
After everyone's long been gone
But me, I was hidin', or forgotten
The only one left
Now the world is mine alone
With no one, no one to share the memory
Of frost out the window this morning
After you're gone
And the house is mine alone

You're my best friend
Now I've no one to tell
How I lost my best friend
The frost, it looks
Like we've been left in the attic
But you're not here to see
It's just witness-less me

"Star"

Remember when we met
We acted like two fools
We were so glad
So glad to have found it

That love is like a star, it's gone
We just see it shining
It's traveled very far, I'll
Keep a leftover light burning
So you can keep looking up
Isn't that worth holding on

You know I'd always been alone
Till you taught me
To live for somebody

That love is like a star
It's gone, we just see it shining
'Cause it's traveled very far, I'll
Keep a leftover light burning
So you can keep looking up
I am yours

No matter that love's gone
We just see it shining
We've traveled very far, I'll
Keep a leftover light burning
So you can keep looking up
Isn't that worth holding on

"I'm Your Man"

You're an angel, I'm a dog
Or you're a dog and I'm your man
You believe me like a God
I destroy you like I am

I'm sorry I'm the one you love
No-one will ever love me like you again
So when you leave me, I should die
I deserve it, don't I

I can feel it getting near
Like flashlights coming down the way
One day you'll figure me out
I'll meet judgement by the hounds

People always gave me love
Others were never to blame after all
You believe me like a God
I betray you like a man

"I Love Me After You"

Hmm
Hmm
Hmm

Brushin' my hair naked
Spritz my face with toner
Splash water on my neck
Laughin' in the mirror
Cool water in a glass
Drink it down
How I love me after you
King of all the land

Stride through the house naked
Don't even care that the
Curtains are open
Let the darkness see me
Streets are mine, the night is mine
All my own
How I love me after you
King of all the land
I'm king of all the land

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

"Between The Breaths"
(from "How to Talk to Girls at Parties" soundtrack)

As you look to the stars
Oh, you could find
Illuminated in scars
A face aligned
I am saving the space
Between the breaths
I am making your place
Between the breaths

As the flame is to snow
First love to last
I will laugh in your face
Like shattered glass
I'm saving the space
Between the breaths
We are saving a place
Between the breaths

Between the breaths
Between the breaths
Between the breaths
Between the breaths
I've seen it
Oh, and I'll breathe it
I've seen it
Oh, and I'll breathe it
(Between the breaths)

I never said where I came from
You never asked what I was made of
You didn't need to know
You already know
I said it even so
You didn't need to know
You never said you couldn't see me
Never a hint you couldn't be me
I could never say
I didn't need to say
Now I'm fine although
It was touch-and-go

Counting the breaths
Until you
Oh, la la
Oh, la la
Oh, la la
Oh, la la

The distance between us
Solved by a shrug
Just a shrug of dark matter
Just a shrug of dark matter

You thought you saw a new star
You caught a fright
You think you wish you may
You wish you might
Be saving the space
Between the breaths
We are saving a place
Between the breaths

I've seen it
Oh, and I'll breathe it
I've seen it
Oh, and I'll breathe it
Between the breaths
Between the breaths
Between the breaths

You never said you couldn't see me
Never a hint you couldn't be me
I could never say
I didn't need to say
I said it even though
You didn't need to know

A sky full of messages
Sealed up in bottles
Smash the omens
Our days are not numbered
Scream in my mouth
I'll barely hear you

Flame to snow
First love to last
Brand on brow
First love to now
Questions posed
Uncut the throat
You don't have to ask
First love to last

Let's meet at the same time
Every night
Starlight on skin
Is a million years old
You never asked my age.
You never questioned my rage
Let's meet at the same time
Every morning
The blood in my gut
Is a thousand years old
But you are the sweetest infection
You are the sweetest infection

I could never know
I didn't need to know
You said it even though
You could never know

Oh, no no oh
Oh, no no oh
Oh, no no oh

"Bite The Hand"

I can't hear you, you're too far away
I can't see you, the light is in my face
I can't touch you, I wouldn't if I could

I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to

Here's the best part, distilled for you
But you want what I can't give to you
Your hands are grabbing while my hands are tied

I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to

Who do you think you are
Who do you think I am
What do you want to say
What do you think will change
Maybe I'm afraid of you
Maybe I'm afraid of you

I'll bite the hand that feeds me
Bite the hand that feeds me
Bite the hand
Bite the hand
Bite the hand that needs me
Bite the hand that needs me
Bite the hand
Bite the hand

I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to

I can't love you how you want me to

"Me & My Dog"

We had a great day
Even though we forgot to eat
And you had a bad dream
And we got no sleep
'Cause we were kissing

I had a fever
Until I met you
Now you make me cool
But sometimes I still do
Something embarrassing

I never said I'd be all right
Just thought I could hold myself together
When I couldn't breathe, I went outside
Don't know why I thought it'd be any better
I'm fine now, it doesn't matter

I didn't wanna be this guy
I cried at your show with the teenagers
Tell your friend I'll be all right
In the morning it won't matter

I wanna be emaciated
I wanna hear one song without thinking of you
I wish I was on a spaceship
Just me and my dog and an impossible view

I dream about it
And I wake up falling

"Souvenir"

[Julien Baker]
Dreamcatcher on the rearview mirror
Hasn't caught a thing yet
Twenty dollars and a souvenir
Anything's worth trying

To stay out of your nightmares
Say I was in your dream last night
Always end up dying
You said, because of course I did
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh

[Phoebe Bridgers]
Always managed to move in
Right next to cemeteries
And never far from a hospital
I don't know what that tells you about me

[Lucy Dacus]
Pulling thorns out of my palm
Work a midnight surgery
When you cut a hole into my skull
Do you hate what you see
Like I do
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh

"Stay Down"

Wasn't a fighter until somebody told me
I had better learn to lean into the punch
So it don't hurt as bad when they leave
There you were, turning your cheek

I look at you and you look at a screen
I'm in the back seat of my body
I'm just steering my life in a video game
Similar acts and a different name

It's a slow down

So would you teach me I'm the villain, aren't I
Aren't I the one constantly repenting for a difficult mind
Push me down into the water like a sinner, hold me under
And I'll never come up again

I'll just stay down

It's a half life, it's a fallout
It takes so long for me to settle down
And when I finally do, there's no one else around

So I stay down
So I stay down
So I stay down
So I stay down
So I stay down

"Salt In The Wound"

You put salt in the wound
And a kiss on my cheek
You butter me up
And you sit down to eat
You add insult to injury
You say you believe in me
But you haven't decided
About taking or leaving me

But you take and you take
Like silks up my sleeve
Tied corner to corner, never ending
Trick after trick, I make the magic
And you unrelentingly ask for the secret

Neck full of mockingbirds
All calling your name
I tried to sing it all back
Like I heard it, it don't sound the same
I'm gnashing my teeth
Like a child of Cain
If this is a prison, I'm willing to buy my own chain

But you take and you take
Like silks up my sleeve
Tied corner to corner, never ending
Trick after trick, I make the magic
And you unrelentingly ask for the secret

They say the hearts and minds are on your side
They say the finish line is in your sights
What they don't say is what's on the other side
They say the hearts and minds are on your side

"Ketchum, ID"

'Kay

Back in the States now
In a college town
I would walk around
But it's really coming down
Mesmerized by double lines
Two yellow tightropes
I'm making good time

I am never anywhere
Anywhere I go
When I'm home, I'm never there
Long enough to know

Being in love
Is the same thing as being alone
Giving the sorrow some company
Nothing to say
But stay on the phone
No, I'm sorry I do not know
What else you want from me

I am never anywhere
Anywhere I go
When I'm home, I'm never there
Long enough to know

You say, "How are you"
I say, "I don't know
Let's dissolve the band
Move to Idaho"
Everyone's around
And I hear you smiling
You say, "I love you"
I say, "You too"

I am never anywhere
Anywhere I go
When I'm home, I'm never there
Long enough to know
Ooh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh
I am never anywhere
Anywhere I go
When I'm home, I'm never there
Long enough

"Without You Without Them"

Give me everything you've got
I'll take what I can get
I want to hear your story and be a part of it

Thank your father before you
His mother before him
Who would I be without you, without them

Speak to me, speak to me, speak to me
Until your history's no mystery to me

Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
Until the words run dry
We'll see eye to eye

I'll give everything I've got
Please take what I can give
I want you to hear my story and be a part of it

Thank my father before me
His mother before him
Who would I be without you, without them

"$20"

It's a bad idea and I'm all about it
Give it one more chance and
Then I finally had it
When you wake up, I'll be gone again
Motorcycle in the front lawn

It's an all-night drive from your house to Reno
To the T-bird graveyard where we play with fire
In another life, we were arsonists
How long's the Chevy been on cinder blocks

Mama told me that it don't run
On wishes but that I should have fun
Pushing the flowers that come up
Into the front of a shotgun
So many hills to die on

Run out of gas, out of time, out of money
You're doing what you can, just makin' it run
(Take a break, make your escape)
Gas, out of time, out of money
You're doing what you can, just makin' it run
(There's only so much I can
Take a break, make your escape)
May I please have twenty dollars
Gas, out of time, out of money
You're doing what you can, just makin' it run
(There's only so much I can
Take a break, make your escape)
Can you give me twenty dollars
(Gas, out of time, out of money
You're doing what you can, just makin' it run)
(There's only so much I can
Take a break, make your escape)
(Gas, out of time, out of money
You're doing what you can, just makin' it run)
(There's only so much I can
Take a break, make your escape)
I know you have twenty dollars
I know you have twenty dollars

"Emily I'm Sorry"

She's asleep in the backseat
Looking peaceful enough to me
But she's wakin' up inside a dream
Full of screeching tires and fire
We're comin' back from where no one lives
Pretty much just veterans
When I pointed out where the North Star is
She called me a fuckin' liar

Emily (Emily), I'm sorry, I just
Make it up as I go along
Yet, I can feel myself becoming (I can feel)
Someone only you could want

Headed straight for the concrete
In a nightmare screaming
Now I'm wide awake, spiraling
And you don't wanna talk
Just take me back to Montral
I'll get a real job, you'll go back to school
We can burn out in the freezing cold
And just get lost

Emily (Emily), I'm sorry, baby
You know how I get when I'm wrong (You know how I get)
And I can feel myself becoming (I can feel)
Somebody I'm not, I'm not, so
Emily (Emily), forgive me, can we
Make it up as we go along
I'm twenty-seven and I don't know who I am (Don't know who I am)
But I know what I want

Emily, I'm sorry
Emily, I'm sorry
I'm sorry

"True Blue"

You said you wanted to feel alive
So we went to the beach
You were born in July, '95
In a deadly heat
You say you're a winter bitch
But summer's in your blood
You can't help but become the sun

When you moved to Chicago
You were spinnin' out
When you don't know who you are
You fuck around and find out
When you called me from the train
Water freezin' in your eyes
You were happy and I wasn't surprised

And it feels good to be known so well
I can't hide from you like I hide from myself

Now you're movin' in
Breakin' a sweat on your upper lip
And gettin' pissed about humidity
And the leaky faucet
You already hurt my feelings three times
In the way only you could

But it feels good to be known so well
I can't hide from you like I hide from myself
I remember who I am when I'm with you
Your love is tough, your love is tried and true blue
Blue

You've never done me wrong
Except for that one time
That we don't talk about
Because it doesn't matter anymore
Who won the fight I don't know
We're not keeping score

And it feels good to be known so well
I can't hide from you like I hide from myself
I remember who I am when I'm with you
Your love is tough, your love is tried and true blue
(Blue, blue, blue)

"Cool About It"

Met you at the dive bar to go shoot some pool
And make fun of the cowboys with the neck tattoos
Ask you easy questions about work and school
I'm trying to be cool about feeling like an absolute fool about
Wishing you were kind enough to be cruel about it
Telling myself I can always do without it
Knowing that it probably isn't true

I came prepared for absolution if you'd only ask
So I take some offense when you say, "No regrets"
I remember it's impossible to pass your test
But I'm trying to forget about it
Feeling like I'm breaking a sweat about it
Wishing you would kindly get out of my head about it
Telling myself one day I'll forget about it
Knowing that it probably isn't true

Once I took your medication to know what it's like
And now I have to act like I can't read your mind
I ask you how you're doing and I let you lie
But we don't have to talk about it
I can walk you home and practice method acting
I'll pretend being with you doesn't feel like drowning
Telling you it's nice to see how good you're doing
Even though we know it isn't true

"Not Strong Enough"

Black hole opened in the kitchen
Every clock's a different time
It would only take the energy to fix it
I don't know why I am

The way I am
Not strong enough to be your man
I tried, I can't
Stop staring at the ceiling fan and
Spinning out about things that haven't happened
Breathing in and out

Drag racing through the canyon
Singing "Boys Don't Cry"
Do you see us getting scraped up off the pavement
I don't know why I am

The way I am
Not strong enough to be your man
I lied, I am
Just lowering your expectations
Half a mind that keeps the other second guessing
Close my eyes and count

Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god

Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god

Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god

I don't know why I am the way I am
There's something in the static
I think I've been having revelations
Coming to in the front seat, nearly empty
Skip the exit to our old street and go home
Go home alone

"Revolution 0"

Mm, hmm, hmm, hmm

Imaginary friend
You live up in my head
So I've been making music
Since you told me to do it

I just want to know
Who broke your nose
Figure out where they live
So I can kick their teeth in

If it isn't love, then what the fuck is it
I guess just let me pretend

I don't want to die
That's a lie
But I'm afraid to get sick
I don't know what that is

You wanted a song
So it's gonna be a short one
Wish I wasn't so tired
But I'm tired

If you're not enough
Then I give up and then nothing is

I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I

I used to think if I just closed my eyes
I would disappear

"Leonard Cohen"

On the on-ramp, you said
"If you love me, you will listen to this song."
And I could tell that you were serious so I
Didn't tell you you were driving the wrong way
On the interstate until the song was done

You felt like an idiot, adding an hour to the drive
But it gave us more time to embarrass ourselves
Telling stories we wouldn't tell anyone else
You said, "I might like you less now that you know me so well."
I might like you less now that you know me so well

Leonard Cohen once said, "There's a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in."
And I am not an old man having an existential crisis
At a Buddhist monastery writing horny poetry
But I agree
I never thought you'd happen to me
I never thought you'd happen to me

"Satanist"

Will you be a satanist with me
Mortgage off your soul to buy your dream
Vacation home in Florida
The collateral the devil's repossessing from me
Trying to score some off-brand ecstasy

Will you be an anarchist with me
Sleep in cars and kill the bourgeoisie
At least until you find out what a fake I am
Spray-paint my initials on an ATM
I'd burn the cash and smash my old TV

Will you be a nihilist with me
If nothing matters, man, that's a relief
Solomon had a point when he wrote Ecclesiastes
If nothing can be known, then stupidity is holy
If the void becomes a bore, we'll treat ourselves to some self-belief

Oh, you know what I should do

You wonder
If you can even be seen
From so far away
A slow pull, a seismic drift
Leaning over the edge of a continent
It's so hard to come back
You hang on until it drags
You under
You under
You under
You under

"We're In Love"

You could absolutely break my heart
That's how I know that we're in love
I don't need the symbol of a scar
So put down the knife
We're not swapping blood

Isn't it enough
That we stripped down to our skin
Cold and porcelain
Like bathers in a painting
And I told you of your past lives, every man you've ever been
It wasn't flattering
But you listened like it mattered

I feel crazy in ways I never say
Will you still love me if it turns out I'm insane
I know what you'll say
But it helps to hear you say it, anyway

Some October, in the future, I'll run out of trash TV
And I'll be feeling lonely
So I'll walk to karaoke
Sing the song you wrote about me, never once checking the words
I hope that no one sings along
I hope that I am not a regular

Damn, that makes me sad
It doesn't have to be like that
If you rewrite your life, may I still play a part

In the next one, will you find me
I'll be the boy with the pink carnation pinned to my lapel
Who looks like hell
And asks for help
And if you do
I'll know it's you

I can't imagine you without
The same smile in your eyes
There is something about you
That I will always recognize
And if you don't remember
I will try to remind you
Of the hummingbirds
You know the ones
And the baby scorpion
And the winter lunar halo
And the walk we took in the Redwoods
I could go on and on and on and I will
Go on and on and on until
It all comes back

"Anti-Curse"

Getting deep
I'm out of my depth at a public beach
I never listened, I had to see for myself
It's coming in waves
Shoots through my mind like a pinball straight
Friendly fire, point blank

Salt in my lungs
Holding my breath
Making peace with my inevitable death

I guess I did alright, considering
Tried to be a halfway decent friend
Wound up a bad comedian
An honest fool with more bad habits than you can count

There we were
Was anyone ever so young
Breaking curfew with illegal fireworks
Unpacking God in the suburbs

I'm swimming back

You say you don't have to make it bad
Just 'cause you know how

Writing the words
To the worst love song you've ever heard
Sounding out the foreign characters
An incantation like an anti-curse
Or even a blessing

"Letter To An Old Poet"

I said I think that you're special
You told me once that I'm selfish
And I kissed you hard
In the dark
In the closet

You said my music is mellow
Maybe I'm just exhausted
You think you're a good person
Because you won't punch me in the stomach

And I love you
I don't know why
I just do

But you're not special, you're evil
You don't get to tell me to calm down
You make me feel like an equal
But I'm better than you and you should know that by now

When you fell down the stairs
It looked like it hurt and I wasn't sorry
I should've left you right there
With your hostages my heart and my car keys

You don't know me
I wanna be happy
I'm ready
To walk into my room without looking for you
I'll go up to the top of our building
And remember my dog when I see the full moon

I can't feel it yet
But I am waiting

"Black Hole"

In a rainstorm
Sucking down a dart
On the back porch
Out here, it gets so dark
You can see the stars, the ones the headlines said
This morning were being spat out
By what we thought was just destroying everything for good

White teeth
Black light
White tee
Brown eyes
Bad boy
Big fight
You're a
Good guy

Good day
Good night
Good talk
Goodbye
It's out of your hands, but
Have a
Safe flight

My thoughts
All noise
Fake smile
Decoys
Sometimes
I need
To hear
Your voice

"Afraid Of Heights"

I know that I fucked up when I
Told you I'm afraid of heights
It made you wanna test my courage
You made me climb a cliff at night
You wanted me to jump and I declined
You called me a coward, I replied
"I don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna die tonight"

When the black water ate you up
Like a sugar cube in a teacup
I got the point you were makin'
When I held my breath 'til you came up

There's been a run of fires downtown
On half-built construction sites
I know you never liked a townhouse
I've seen you climb a crane at night
If they ever catch you at it
I know you'd want me to be proud
That you took a rich man's dream
And brought it with you on your way down

"'Cause one man's dream is another man's death"
I remember when you told me that
Didn't know what to say, so I just laughed
But now I know it's not funny

I never rode a motorcycle
I've never smoked a cigarette
I wanna live a vibrant life
But I wanna die a boring death
I know I was a disappointment
Know you wanted me to take a risk
Not everybody gets the chance to live
A life that isn't dangerous

You called me a crybaby
But you're the one who got teary
Tellin' me what you believe
How we're stuck in entropy
How it hurts to hope
Oh, it hurts to hope for more
Oh, it hurts to hope the future
Will be better than before

"Voyager"

Mmm, mmm

It's a hundred and three in the Valley
Blacktop is meltin' on our shoes (Mmm)
And I don't mean to make it all about me (Mmm)
But I used to believe no one could love you like I do (Mmm)
And I'm startin' to think that it might be impossible not to (Mmm)

There are days spent tangled up together (Mmm)
And sometimes, you let me read your mind (Ooh)
Then there are nights you say you don't remember
When you stepped on the gas and you asked if I'm ready to die (Mmm)
You thought I'd never leave and I let you believe you were right (Mmm)

Walkin' alone in the city
Makes me feel like a man on the moon (Ooh)
Every small step I took was so easy (Mmm)
But I never imagined a dot quite as pale or as blue (Ooh)
You took it from me, but I would've given it to you (Mmm)

"Powers"

How did it start Did I fall into a nuclear reactor
Crawl out with acid skin or somethin' worse
A hostile alien ambassador
Or am I simply another of the universe's failed experiments
Either way, I have been wonderin' just how it is (How it is)
I have never heard (Never heard) the tale of how I got my powers

Thrust into bein', careenin' along
On a crooked little trajectory
Dissolvin' in movement, a body in orbit
Or a roach on his way to the gutter

The tail of a comet burned up in an instant, the destruction of matter
There's no object to be seen in the supercollider
Just a light in the tunnel and whatever gets scattered
Life flashin' before the eye of whatever comes after
The force of our impact, the fission
The hum of our contact, the sound of our collisions

"Boyfriends"

She's out on the back deck
Talking to her marigolds
Sitting in a sundress
Listening to bands nobody knows

You don't have to do that
They're either gonna die or they will grow
Guess you're talking to yourself then
You can never stand to be alone
Time can be a savage
It will bring you peace but makes you old
Hell is gonna have it
She says, "Get a fucking job or just come home"

But you're not gonna go back
You never liked the freezing snow
Stuck out in the midwest
Standing at another house show

You always wanna save them
You think that you can change them
I think you're blaming yourself
But you say the medication, it helps

Calling in the morning
Asking me to analyze your dreams
What happened to your boyfriend
You don't think about him when you sleep
I guess that's why you're sleeping
I guess that's why you're gardening
Back out on the coast again
Looking for a second chance

You always wanna save them
You think that you can change them
I think you're blaming yourself
But you say the medication, it helps

What happened to your boyfriend
What happened to your boyfriend
What happened to your boyfriend
What happened to your boyfriend"Dominic"

Oh, let them talk while we lie in the grass
It flatters the world even if it won't last
Forgive me if I was too forward too fast
But not being yours would be wasteful

Oh, Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after
Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

Oh, let them talk while you reach for my hand
Replacing a drowning idea of a man
And when we get home with our shoes filled with sand
We'll just sleep and forget that we're strangers

Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after
Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

And when you step out that door
You'll leave me unafraid of change
And I...
And when you step out that door
You'll leave me unafraid of change

Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

"Dominic (French Version)"

Oh, laisse les parler pendant que l'on dort sur le sable
Cela flatte le monde, mme si a ne durera pas
Or pardonne moi de m'tre emporte si vite
Ce serait un gchis de ne pas tre  toi

Dominique, toi et moi
C'est un exquis dsastre
Nos chemins se sparent  l'aube du lendemain
Dominique, toi et moi
C'est un exquis dsastre
Nos chemins se sparent  l'aube du lendemain

Oh, laisse les parler alors que tu prends ma main
Estompant le souvenir de l'empreinte de quelqu'un
Et quand nous rentrons, les cheveux sals par l'air marin
On s'endort et oublie qu'on se connait presque pas

Dominique, toi et moi
C'est un exquis dsastre
Nos chemins se sparent  l'aube du lendemain
Dominique, toi et moi
C'est un exquis dsastre
Nos chemins se sparent  l'aube du lendemain

Emporte cette partie de moi
Dans laquelle je me reconnais pas

Emporte cette partie de moi
Dans laquelle je me reconnais pas
Dominique
(Toi et moi, c'est un exquis dsastre)
Dominique
(Toi et moi, [])

"Arcadia"

Cars they were passing
Waves they were crashing on the shore
Fingers were burning the pages they're turning
And I want more
Here I ran from the west
Unto ruins where the sun dances with death

Arcadia, Arcadia
Now she holds me tight like I held you
Arcadia, Arcadia
Hour after hour golden blue

To be had...

Arcadia, Arcadia
Now I know that time forgets us too
Arcadia, Arcadia
Hour after hour golden blue

"Backwards And Upwards"

Love
What a mean
Poison arrow welcome to me
What a shot
When I
Bent over to tie shoe laces
Cut it out
At the seed
And the rip is a rotation
Drawing O
In the sky
With no answers in the jury

Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Backwards and up, up, up up

Take the wheel

Oh, the driver is fine
But the passenger is carsick
Back it up
Turn around
Like a ferris wheel I shift it
"Oh, it burns
But it cleans"
Say the nurses in their tunics
"Just admit
You were wrong
It's the opposite of foolish"

Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and up, up, up up

Backwards
Backwards
Uh huh, backwards, backwards
Words, words, words

"Getaway Ride"

Pass the screwdriver
(Cha cha cha)
Here's a key
To the courtyard
By the cemetery
(Cha cha cha)
When the world is watching
I'll take the easy way out
To wait until your signal
While you burn the place down

I'll pick you up from where you hide
In uniform with tie untied
No talking baby just the slamming of the doors
Of our getaway ride

So what
(what now)
Of this
(this is)
Desire
(Cha cha cha)
I'm a thief
(Blind thief)
In the schoolyard
(baby)
Or just wanting to be
(Cha cha cha)
Breaking single file
Tell me you want to escape
Down the road to nowhere
To watch my heart break

I'll pick you up from where you hide
In uniform with tie untied
No talking baby just the slamming of the doors
Of our getaway ride

So what
And so what

Ride We can make it
Oh, I've all but lost my mind
Take the rest of me
Take it all
You're my destiny
Ooh
Baby don't be ashamed

Ride...
Ride...

"Avenues"

Between the buoy of dreaming
And the anchor of home
I had you
Leaning into the beams
In the fading heat
I showed you yours, you showed me mine

All my avenues are green
No trembling or goodbye
But the shadows know I miss you
Dearly, dearly
So sincerely

Under buoys of dreams
Above an anchor home
I found you
And though you can't call me lover
I'm a star in your sky
Baby, I'm a loner by design

All my avenues are green
As heartache is unwise
Ashes scatter of what happened
Nearly, nearly
So sincerely

"Lady's Got Gills"

Why is your pretty friend wearing her collar high
Why does she turn away when you look at her in the eye
It gives me the chills
It's like you to want the one
The one that you couldn't keep
Watch how she holds her breath
And leaves when you go to sleep

The lady's got gills
There's nothing you can do about it, yeah
The lady's got gills
There's nothing you can do about it, yeah

You'd give everything you have
If she'd just promise to come back
From her unexplained trips to the harbor
Where the tide runs black
There's no sense in trading places
To lock her up and keep her in the bath
Or learn how to hold her breath

The lady's got gills
There's nothing you can do about it, yeah
The lady's got gills
There's nothing you can do about it, yeah

Watching from the shore
No, you don't want to lose her
To the roar insatiable
Would you rather drown than say goodbye

"Dominic"

Oh, let them talk while we lie in the grass
It flatters the world even if it won't last
Forgive me if I was too forward too fast
But not being yours would be wasteful

Oh, Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after
Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

Oh, let them talk while you reach for my hand
Replacing a drowning idea of a man
And when we get home with our shoes filled with sand
We'll just sleep and forget that we're strangers

Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after
Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

And when you step out that door
You'll leave me unafraid of change
And I...
And when you step out that door
You'll leave me unafraid of change

Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

"Reprise"

Cold, unworthy, fickle heart
That's all too late in learning
That if I should love you till the last
I'll leave you be

"Izzit True What They Tell Me"

The second you offered me a ride
I couldn't get the thought out of my mind
Promises open when they're pried
Up with the vapor of a week of sighs
The cards say, "A change is coming near
And as a nestling on the bough
The fool is the martyr of the now"

Izzit true what they tell me
Izzit true what they tell me
Izzit true what they tell me
Izzit true what they tell me

Inviting you in a second time
How your possessions were lighter than mine
And how we talked all through the night
As if I'd have known you all of my life
Touching your finger to my eye
How you prove the card was right
That said you'd be all I have in sight

Izzit true what they tell me
Izzit true what they tell me
Izzit true what they tell me
Izzit true what they tell me

Ay, is the lesson cast asunder
Oh, and you can't even know
What kind of lack that you're leaving
Ay, want a rented bed of sorrow
Go to hell I adore you
Ay, ever-righteous call of thunder
Oh, I don't know what to call it
But I know that you feel it
Ay, ever-wretched call of wonder
With no regrets...
Now I receive you on the day
I hide and seek you on the hour
(In time)
In odysseys of no and yes
Even now, as a witness...
And even now...

Am I a finch, am I the cage
O either way I couldn't care
If you could see inside my head
Where every clock is stopped by you
Like in some silent threat
Like I'm the one that should be careful
Though it never could've happened without you
No it never could have happened without you...

Budding interrupted
In glory of their matching
Winding up the rope
Together and alone
Tell me a story
Leaving out the ending
I don't want to know
Whose heart was made to roam

Izzit true what they tell me
Izzit true what they tell me
Izzit true what they tell me
Izzit true what they tell me

"Wings Of The Parapets"

The wings of the parapets
Watch over the stage of joy and rage
They watch as I catch flight
And you fill the fuel to give me a ride

Here above the open ledge
With no control of which to speak
Oh, if love is a dependency
Resign me

Hear, a dove in the cargo bay
An-hundred miles beneath his feet
Oh, if love is the opposite of free
Resign me

"The Gate"

Standing at the gate
I come here every day
Just to see your face
Just to hear you say
"There's no need to wait
We will be okay"
'Cause finally there's a way
To be both free and safe

"Pang"

There's a look in your eyes when you're hungry for me
It's a beautiful knife cutting right where the fear should be

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me

Tell me what you're afraid of
Tell me what night is made of
What can I not destroy for you
Color the night electric
Get in me like a secret
I open the door and you run through

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me

Color the night electric
Get in me like a secret
I open the door and you run through

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me

(Tell me what you're afraid of)
There's a look in your eyes when you're hungry for me
(Tell me what you're afraid of)
It's a beautiful knife cutting right where the fear should be

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me

Color the night electric
Get in me like a secret
I open the door and you run through

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me

Into you (Pang)
Into me (Pang)
Into you (Pang)
Into me (Pang)
Oh, woah, oh
Into me (Pang)
Into you (Pang)

"New Normal"

Now, what is this
Feeling I know you from long ago
From deep in my past
I don't know why
Why I trust you completely
Don't question it
The bottle is empty

Now, what is this
Club closing early
The fog machines
And lasers swirling
It's Halloween
I'm sorry for screaming
But I'm afraid
I scare you completely

Now, what is this
Blizzard in April
I'm underdressed as usual
And you're cheating death
Buying time through the winter
It's house arrest
No stopping for dinner

Now, what is this
Microphone working
Can't hear myself
The cameras are rolling
And there's the cue
My heart, it beats so hard
I look for you, and suddenly fall

Now, what is this
Robin you rescued
Has broken wing
Not broken long
You search the room
Someone yells from the garden
The orange cat
Finish what you started

Now, what is this
Skidding of tires
I hold my breath
And you're running fast
As the SUV
Smashes into the sidewalk
And 911
Won't answer the call

Now, what is this
Hollywood ghost town
A shootout scene
No actors at all
Last night I dreamed
You and I were immortal
It's no big deal
This new kind of normal

"Hit Me Where It Hurts"

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
Go on and hit me in the

Bullseye, dead end
Moving target
Carousel, carousel
Baggage, claim it
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out
Ride it out, ride it out

Magic carpet
Over London
Through the ceiling
Watch you dreaming
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out
Ride it out

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
Go on and hit me in the

Blind spot, Achilles' heel
Long shot, left field
Vertigo, vertigo
High stakes, popped ears
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out
Ride it out, ride it out

Do you feel safe
(Hit me where it hurts now)
Now that you've found my cure
I'll be the nurse
(Hit me where it hurts now)
You'll be my number one
Hit me where it hurts now
Hit me where it hurts
Hit me where it hurts now
Hit me where it hurts
Hit me where it hurts now
Hit me where it hurts
Hit me where it hurts now

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane (Hit me where it hurts)
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
Go on and hit me in the

"I Give Up"

When I stop caring, you stop caring
When I care less and you care less than me
When I don't need and I don't believe in
The hollow phrases you still repeat
You and I, we fall apart
Now I know what it means to unravel
It's a new and shallow grief
A pathetic kind of sad relief

It didn't used to feel this good to be all alone
Doing every damn thing I can to not go home

I give up
I give up on you now
I give up
How far can you fall
When you're already down

I gave you that told-you-so look, it's so crazy
And you gave me that list of things about myself to change
And now these days it's every night, babe
It's not a rough patch, it's not a phase
You and I, we fall apart
Now I know what it means to unravel
It's a new and shallow grief
And a pathetic kind of self-defeat

It didn't used to feel this good to be all alone
Doing every damn thing I can to not go home

I give up
I give up on you now
I give up
How far can you fall
When you're already down
I give up
I give up on you now
I give up
How far can you fall
When you're already down

"Look At Me Now"

Wrote myself a letter
Just a single question
When you finally get this
Where will you be
Will you be a shipwreck or a star
Falling for a boy who doesn't play guitar
Now rewind the tape back to the start
Said I'd never leave you, but here we are

And you can't look at me now
I haven't changed, I'm still the same
But you can't look at me now
A hand grenade to throw away

Now my friends all tell me
"Girl, you're getting skinny
Have you not been sleeping"
How could I be
Trying to find the lightswitch in the dark
Burying the good girl I know I'm not
Now rewind the tape back to the start
Said I'd never leave you, but here we are

And you can't look at me now
I haven't changed, I'm still the same
But you can't look at me now
A hand grenade to throw away

I can't run anymore
Gotta stay right here and face the storm
I can't run anymore
Where the wakeup call is all I know
I can't run anymore
(I can't run anymore)
Gotta stay right here and face the storm
I can't run anymore
(I can't run anymore)

You can't look at me now
I haven't changed, I'm still the same
But you can't look at me now
A hand grenade to throw away
Look at me now
(I can't run anymore)
You can't look at me now
(I can't run anymore)

"Insomnia"

How long can sunlight stay warm in the storm
How long 'til the bath runs cold

Come dawn, come day, come half-awake
Come blue, come gray, come waves that break
And it's not enough
No reply, no relief

Dreams of dried fields
That once were green
Burnt by someone just like me

Come dawn, come day, come half-awake
Come blue, come gray, come waves that break
And it's not enough
No reply, no relief

Hold on
Hold on
To save a single living piece of us
I still got it
I still got your heat

"Ocean Of Tears"

This is gonna be torture
Before it's sublime
Does that make it crazy
Cash in all of my courage
Before you're all mine
Does that make it crazy

Oh my god, I wanna know what it feels like
To pull you close and tangle up with you real tight
The only thing that's separating you and me tonight
Ah, is an ocean of tears
Oh my god, I wanna know what it feels like
Just an inch away from living a dream life
The only thing that's separating you and me tonight
Ah, is an ocean of tears

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Show me the future
Yeah, I'm all eyes
Tell me you're ready (I'm ready)
Pulse was rising and racing and racing and racing
But it's a long ride
Tell me you're ready

Oh my god, I wanna know what it feels like
To pull you close and tangle up with you real tight
The only thing that's separating you and me tonight
Ah, is an ocean of tears
Oh my god, I wanna know what it feels like
Just an inch away from living a dream life
The only thing that's separating you and me tonight
Ah, is an ocean of tears

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Someone stop me, I'm coming down
Ooh, ooh
Someone stop me, I'm coming down
Ooh, ooh

Show me the fu-fu-fu-, fu-fu-
Yeah, all eyes

"Hey Big Eyes"

I can picture you right now
At a window seat
Crying for nobody except the world
I can picture you right now
Running down the street
Late for nobody except the moon

Hey, big eyes, can you swim
Swim down to me
Hey, red star, can you burn
Burn down to me

Picture me all messed up now
Can't talk to nobody
Cant plan for anything
Except the rain
Today the flags will all fly green
At the embassies
You're here next to me
Except you're not

Hey, big eyes, can you swim
Swim down to me (Swim, swim)
Hey, red star, can you burn
Burn down to me (Burn, burn)

Hey, big eyes, can you swim
Swim down to me
Hey, red star, can you burn
Burn down, burn down

Hey, big eyes, can you swim
Swim down to me (Swim, swim)
Hey, red star, can you burn
Burn down to me (Burn, burn)

"Go As A Dream"

Someone changed the clock
And left the window open
When I must have drifted off
And it's just your kind of trick
To leave me empty-handed
Leave me with a riddle unsolved

Ah, ah, mmm
I don't know if I can do this
I don't know if I can make this peace

And you're almost like that card
Played by the magician
But this time, you're not coming back
And it's slipping through my fists
Blurry at the edges
Leaving only legend

You go as a dream
Go as a dream
Go as a dream
Go as a dream

Ah, ah, mmm
I don't know if I can do this
I don't know if I can make this peace

And it hit me like a brick
A joke without a punchline
A script that nobody read
If you saw me lying here
Through my bedroom ceiling
You would have me pick up my head and

Go as a dream
Go as a dream
Go as a dream
Go as a dream

Ah, ah, mmm
Ah, ah, mmm

"Caroline Shut Up"

Sometimes, I wonder
Do I love you too much
Then I tell myself, "Caroline, shut up"
'Cause there's only one way
One way to find out
If it ever gets better than right now

I dare you to come closer
Let me see you in the light
I dare you to stay with me
You know I get low sometimes
I dare you to make time stop
Instead of speeding up
I dare you to go slow, don't rush

Sometimes, I wonder
Do I love you too much
Then I tell myself, "Caroline, shut up"
'Cause there's only one way
One way to find out
If it ever gets better than right now

Na, na, na, na (Oh)
Now you got me jealous and I'm not the jealous type
Na, na, na, na (Oh)
Spending all the cash that I'm saving up
Na, na, na, na (Oh)
Lying in the bath made of a fountain of wine
Na, na, na, na (Oh)
Looking like a god, you know you fuck me up

Sometimes, I wonder
Do I love you too much
Then I tell myself, "Caroline, shut up"
'Cause there's only one way
One way to find out
If it ever gets better than right now

And this is hard, God
Give me scissors and I'm running on the tightrope
And I've gotta trust it now, ah
Just don't let go
(Sometimes I, sometimes I, sometimes I)

Sometimes, I wonder
Do I love you too much
Then I tell myself, "Caroline, shut up"
If tomorrow, you want me
Then I don't have a doubt
That it gets even better than right now

"So Hot You're Hurting My Feelings"

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Not like I'm counting the days (Ah, ah, ah)
But it's been twenty-five (Ah, ah, ah)
You're out there killing the game (Ah, ah, ah)
But damn, I miss you tonight (Ah, ah, mmm)

And I'm out at a party, they're playing our song
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing
Don't send me photos, you're making it worse
'Cause you're so hot it's hurting my feelings

I get a little lonely
Get a little more close to me
You're the only one who knows me, babe
So hot you're hurting my feelings (Woo)
Can't deal

With all the -rated dreamin' (Ah, ah, ah)
Back on the coast-to-coast life (Ah, ah, ah)
You know I live for the hustle (Ah, ah, ah)
But damn, I miss you tonight (Ah, ah, mmm)

And I'm out at a party, they're playing our song
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing
Don't send me photos, you're making it worse

"Door"

Back in the city
I'm just another girl in a sweater
Perpetual novice
Signature on a check made out to you

Took ten laps 'round the planet
To prove what I wasn't
And the door slams hard behind you
When you leave the house of judgment

Been waiting for regret to hit me
Some kind of reckoning
I waited for the drop, 'cause lately
The yang comes with yin

Back in the city
I'm just another girl in a sweater
Perpetual novice
Signature on a check made out to you
Now there's the sunset
Salt in the wound, yeah
Sometimes I don't know who I'm singing to
Who is the you who I sing to
When the house is empty

You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you
You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you

And we're waking up sore and dizzy
From a ten year concussion
And the rainfall makes you miss me
Even though you say it doesn't

Back in the city
I'm just another girl in a sweater
Back in the city
Everything's different when we're not together

You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you
You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you

Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running

Back in the city
I'm just another girl in a sweater
Perpetual novice
Signature on a check made out to you
Now there's the sunset
Salt in the wound, yeah
Sometimes I don't know who I'm singing to
Who is the you who I sing to
When the house is empty

You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you
You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you

Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running
Oh, oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Ooh, ah

Ooh, oh
Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running

"Parachute"

Awake from a dream
One that started as a nightmare
Like a war so extreme
It erased itself from memory
Here's where I jumped
From the aeroplane without questioning it
The curve of the coast of Los Angeles
Spreading itself below

And blooming overhead, the parachute
I've got to trust it now, oh

Change in the wind
And I'm drifting from the crescent
Pulled farther out
From the shore than where I can swim to it

And blooming overhead, the parachute
I've got to trust it now, oh

Closing in on the sparkle of the waves
Go on, take me, it will feel like going home
Go on, take me, I'm not afraid to drown
What is this, pulling me back the other way
To strip malls, highways, and treetops
Landing on the soft ground

"Welcome To My Island"

Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
Hope you like me, you ain't leavin'
Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
Hope you like me, you ain't leavin'

Desire (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna turn into you
Desire (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna turn into you
Flood (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

I am my father's daughter in the end
He says, "Watch your ego, watch your head, girl
You're so smart, so talented
But now the water's turning red
And it's all your fault and it's all your mess
And you're all alone, you can't go to bed
Too high on your adrenaline
You gotta go somewhere where you can't pretend, oh
Forget the rules, forget your friends
Just you and your reflection
'Cause nothing's gonna be the same again
No, nothing's gonna be the same again"

Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da (Mmm)

Time's running out, innit
Pity the mayflies in the swimming pool at dawn
But down in the deep
I can't be left alone
Sweet Eliza's on the court
Potential is the drug
They never knew, you never tried
But you see it in my eyes, and that is bae
Threading the needle, pretty in possible
If only to get me out the door
Oracle and odyssey
With a bloody nose
If I'm on your street, you'll be the last to know
That I get dizzy (Yeah), dizzy (Yeah) and I cannot afford that kind of free

Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da

Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da (Rich), da-da (Mmm)

Now you got one eye on the lane and one eye on the lava
Spinning out, yeah, I respect that
But I was born to get you home
Home, where it's all red and velveteen
Falling back into the leaves
So true
With your lipstick on my thigh
Drink the tears until they dry-y-y
I-I, I-I, I-I (Eye eye eye eye eye)

Mm-mm-mm, oh
Pretty in possible
Mm-mm-mm, oh
Pretty in possible

Bunny is a rider
Satellite can't find her
No sympathy, hmm
Ain't nothing for free
Bunny is a rider
Satellite can't find her
No sympathy, hmm
Ain't nothing for free
Bunny is a rider
No sympathy, hmm
Ain't nothing
Bunny is a-Bunny is a, a rider
Satellite can't find her
No sympathy, hmm

But I'm so non-physical
I do, I do, feel like the lady
I do, I do, fireworks blazing
I do, I do, heart is unbreaking
I do, I do, but don't drop my name

Bunny is a rider (Bunny is a r...)
Satellite can't find her
No sympathy, hmm
Ain't nothing for free
Bunny is a rider
Giddy up, can't find her
No sympathy, hmm
Ain't nothing for free

Dirty like it's earth day
Tryna wet that palette
Can you cut that check
Crush that wreck
Run out empty on 'em
AWOL on a Thursday
Tryna go ask Alice
Tryna catch that rabbit

But I'm so non-physical
I do, I do, feel like the lady
I do, I do, fireworks blazing
I do, I do, heart is unbreaking
I do, I do, but don't drop my name

"Sunset"

These days
I wear my body like an uninvited guest
I turn it right and right and right
Instead of turning left
But boy, your patience is a magic kind of medicine
'Cause every spiral brings me
Back into your arms again

So no regrets
'Cause you're my sunset
Fiery red
Forever fearless
And in your arms
A warm horizon
Don't look back
Let's ride away
Let's ride away

So many stories we were told about a safety net
But when I look for it, it's just a hand that's holding mine
I'm wearing black to mourn the sudden loss of innocence
And that's alright because it hides the dirt and hides the wine

So no regrets
'Cause you're my sunset
Fiery red
Forever fearless
And in your arms
A warm horizon
Don't look back
Let's ride away
Let's ride away

So no regrets
'Cause you're my sunset
Fiery red
Forever fearless
And in your arms
A warm horizon
Don't look back
Let's ride away (Let's ride away)

"Crude Drawing Of An Angel"

Draw the blinds
Draw the bath
It's a matter of time
Til you wake up and watch me
Draw your brow
With shaky hand
So that after you're gone
I got something to hold onto

Red light
Oh my faults
Camera one, camera two
Oh my greed
On your side, on the carpet
Oh your need
Camera one, camera two

Angel
I'd hold you down
Forsake me
Here on the ground
All or nothing

Draw your blood
Draw your breath
Skip the whites of your eyes
Til you wake up and watch me
Draw your wings
From your back
I'll not be shy
No, I'll not be gentle with you

Red light
Oh my faults
Camera one, camera two
Oh my greed
On your side, on the carpet
Oh your need
Camera one, camera two

Angel
I'd hold you down
Forsake me
Here on the ground
All or nothing

All or nothing

"I Believe"

(Look over the edge, but not too far)

You're not alone
Under a sky of vultures
With all that could've been
You made it home
With silver string unbroken
Ain't that the sweetest gift

Oh, little miracle
Swing low
Where there can be no compromises
Down low

I don't know but I believe
We'll get another day together
Violent love, feel my embrace, oh
No, I don't know but I believe

And I'd have said it was impossible
To find you in this life and keep you just enough

Oh, little miracle
Swing low
Where there can be no compromises
Down low

I don't know but I believe (Oh)
We'll get another day together (Oh)
Violent love, feel my embrace, oh (Oh)
No, I don't know but I believe

(Look over the edge, but not too far)
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh (Look over the edge, but not too far)
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh

I don't know but I believe
We'll get another day together
Violent love, feel my embrace, oh
No, I don't know but I believe (Ah)

Violent love, feel my embrace
(Look over the edge, but not too far)
(But not too far)

"Fly To You"
(feat. Grimes & Dido)

How I remember, how I forget
Wanted to hate you but love you instead
Violence made me gentle at last
Closer and closer and closer to you
Baby, I'm dying to find you

Ooh, I fly to you (Hey)
After all the tears (Hey)
You're all I need (Hey)
I fly to you (Woo)
Not just somewhere
Deep inside of me (Hey)

Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah (Hey)
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah (Hey)
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah (Woo)
Ah-ah

Driving through the dark
Lost but I'm free
I'm looking for something
That nobody else can see (See)
Will you still love me
After the bend (The bend)
Remember what's gone before
Not loaded with regret (Regret)

Ooh, I fly to you (Hey)
After all the tears (Hey)
You're all I need (Hey)
I fly to you (Woo)
Not just somewhere
Deep inside of me (Hey)

(Hey)
(Hey)
(Woo)

Mmm, I fly to you
After all the tears
You're all I need
I fly to you
Not just somewhere
Deep inside of me (How I remember)
Ooh, I fly to you (How I forget)
After all the tears (Wanted to hate you, but love you instead)
You're all I need (violence made me)
I fly to you (Gentle at last)
Not just somewhere (Closer and closer and closer to you)
Deep inside of me (Baby, I'm dying to find out)

I'm looking for something
Nobody else can see
Remember what's gone before
Not loaded with regret

"Blood And Butter"

I look at you, in denim and bows
I know the mode, the mode is lethal
Say you wanna show me your place
The place is here, the here is inside you
Where did you come from, you

I'm pretty with the critical mass
Your body has the body power
Layin' at the foot of a linden
In the navel ring, inventing June
Where did you come from, you

And what I want is, to walk beside you
Needing nothing, but the sun that's in our eyes
Paint the picture in blood and butter
Holy water, fire in sky

Let me dive through your face
To the sweetest kind of pain
Call you up, nothin' to say
No, I don't need no one entertaining
When the world is a bed
Give me green and ribbon red
Oh, get closer than your new tattoo

Look at you all mythicalogical
And wikipediated
Look how I forget who I was
Before I was the way I am with you
Where did you come from, you

And what I want is, to walk beside you
Needing nothing, but the sun that's in our eyes
Paint the picture in blood and butter
Holy water, fire in sky

Let me dive through your face
To the sweetest kind of pain
Call you up, nothin' to say
No, I don't need no one entertaining
When the world is a bed
Give me green and ribbon red
Oh, get closer than your new tattoo

Closer than your

"Hopedrunk Everasking"

Starlight in the tunnel
Kind of familiar
Hope-drunk ever-asking
How does it feel to know
Your final form
So old, so new

Pull close to me
And never be alone
Ooh

Real life is a rumor
Under the theatre
Deeper, dig it deeper
Till the meanwhile slows
They'll find our bones
And yet, they won't

Pull close to me
And never be alone
Ooh (Ah)

(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Dawn is just a headspace
Night is a feeling
Hope-drunk ever-asking
Centuries come and go
They'll find our bones
And yet, they won't

"Butterfly Net"

Earth went silent
London fell asleep
She dreamed of winter
Where you appeared to me
Perfect timing as new petals in November
A tender creature
A fever
Disarming, fluorescent

There you were
With your mirror
Shining the world all over me
There I was
With my butterfly net
Trying to catch your light

I collected
Stupid ashes
So that after you'd gone
I could hold onto something
But you stayed unwavering
Through every false goodbye
Unsubsiding
Pining
For now and for never

There you were
With your mirror
Shining the world all over me
There I was
With my butterfly net
Trying to catch your light

Oh if only
The umbrella of the sky
Could wrap us up and up
That's where I'd zoom in close
Dilated as your eyes
But til then I'll keep it brief

Faithful inertia
Her bullet doesn't slow
It seeks and finds me
How far it goes
Heaven help me
Take this bag of wings
And drown it in the thames
And wake tomorrow
Hollow
Hardly forgetting

There you were...
There I was
With my butterfly net
Trying to catch your light

"Smoke"

It's just smoke
Na-na-na, na-na-na

Na-na-na

It's just smoke
Floating over the volcano
It's just smoke
Selling me out on the down low

And you are
The big answer tonight
And you are
Melting everything about me, oh
Don't worry about me
It's just smoke

(Mmm)
(Ah, mmm)

And the fallout doesn't phase me
Take a bullet for my baby
For the one thing that'll save me
I know (Hmm)
Throw it all out and replace it
With a brand new kind of crazy
Don't believe it when you praise me
Do I (Hmm)

And you are
The big answer tonight
And you are
Melting everything about me, oh
Don't worry about me
It's just (Ah)

Na-na-na, na-na-na

"Billions"

Psycho, priceless
Good in a crisis
Working the angles, oh, oh
Billions

Sexting, sonnets
Under the tables
Tangled in cables, oh, oh
Billions

Salting, flavour
Lies like a sailor
But he loves like a painter, oh, oh
Billions

Hand it over, broker
Give me the closure
Here's a pearl of the oyster, oh, oh
Billions

Say, say, say, say something to me
Say, say, say, say something to me

Headless, angel
Body upgraded
But it's dead on arrival, oh, oh
(Billions)

Twisted, manic
Cornucopia
Can my cup overflow with, oh, oh
(Billions)

I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you (I never felt so close to you)
(I never felt so close to you)

Psycho, priceless
Good in a crisis
Working the angles, oh, oh
Billions

Hand it over, broker
Give me the closure
Here's a pearl of the oyster, oh, oh
Billions

(Oh, oh) Say, say, say, say something to me

Oh, I've never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you

Sippin on chartreuse

"Hit Me Where It Hurts (Toro Y Moi Remix)"
(feat. Chino Moreno)

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
Go on and hit me in the

Bullseye, dead end
Moving target
Carousel, carousel
Baggage, claim it
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out
Ride it out, ride it out

Magic carpet
Over London
Through the ceiling
Watch you dreaming
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out
Ride it out

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
Go on and hit me in the

Blind spot, Achilles' heel
Long shot, left field
Vertigo, vertigo
High stakes, popped ears
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out

Do you feel safe
Now that you've found my cure
I'll be the nurse
You'll be my number one

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time

"Last Days Non Voglio Mai Vedere Il Sole Tramontare"

Oh, la mia vita
Tutta la mia vita
Ti ho cercato
Ho cercato il tuo tocco
Come un'alba
Come un vulcano
Abbi piet di me
Abbi piet di me
Non voglio mai vedere il tramonto

Oh, la mia vita
Non ho mai amato cos tanto la vita
(Ho amato cos tanto la vita)
Non voglio che finisca mai

Oh yeah, like you knew me
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let me read your mind
For the final time

But I know what you're feeling (I feel it, too)

So let me tell you how to do it right
You only got one life

Oh yeah, you don't need it
No, yeah, just believe it
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we can make amends
Right before it ends

But I know what you're feeling (I feel it, too)
I know that you're falling (Falling away)
I know what you're thinking (Say the word)
I know that it's o, oh, oh oh oh

"So Cold You're Hurting My Feelings"

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Not like I'm counting the days (Ah, ah, ah)
But it's been twenty-five (Ah, ah, ah)
You're out there riding the sleigh (Ah, ah, ah) (Ho-ho-ho)
But damn, I miss you tonight (Ah, ah, mmm)

And I'm out at a party, they're playing our song
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing
Don't send me presents, you're making it worse
'Cause you're so cold it's hurting my feelings

I get a little lonely
Get a little more close to me
You're the only one who knows me, babe
So cold you're hurting my feelings (Woo)
Can't deal

With all the mistletoe dreamin' (Ah, ah, ah)
Back on the coast-to-coast life (Ah, ah, ah)
You know I live for the Tinsel (Ah, ah, ah)
But damn, I miss you tonight (Ah, ah, mmm)

And I'm out at a party, they're playing our song
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing
Don't send me presents, you're making it worse
'Cause you're so cold it's hurting my feelings

I get a little lonely
Get a little more close to me
You're the only one who knows me, babe
So cold you're hurting my feelings (Woo)
Can't deal

I'm a good girl santa (Na-na-na-na-na)

I get a little lonely
Get a little more close to me

"Welcome To My Island (George Daniel & Charli C Remix)"

I like to live my life luxurious
Eating caviar toast, buying out the Ritz
I've been told I can be tricky in relationships
'Cause I need someone who can take on all the challenges
I won't lie, yeah, I've always been afraid to commit
But now I've fallen so hard, it's a total eclipse
'Cause it's emotional and physical and so legit
He's got my legs wide out like banana split
We're always showering each other in expensive gifts
I put the two-tone Cartier on his wrist
It was love at first sight from the moment we kissed
I want a white dress, country side house, and kids
Back at the start, think you knew that I was dangerous
With my face enhanced and my natural lips
I told him, "Catch a flight, see if you can handle it
And if you can then, welcome to my island, bitch"

Welcome to my island, bitch
Welcome to my island, bitch
Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island, bitch
Welcome to my island
I wanna turn into you

I guess I'm on my Richard Branson wave
No virgin, but I knew just how to behave
'Cause I can be a good girl, buxom milkmaid
Or you can drive me down to Florida and fuck me for days
Back at the start, think you knew that I was dangerous
I've done a couple bad things if you catch my drift
I told him, "Baby, you can pull up on the landing strip
And if you do it right, welcome to my island, bitch"

Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island, bitch
Welcome to my island
I wanna turn into you
Welcome to my island, bitch
Desire
I wanna turn into you
Welcome to my island, bitch
Desire
I wanna turn into you

Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
Hope you like me, you ain't leavin'
Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
I wanna turn into you

I wanna turn into you
I wanna turn into you
