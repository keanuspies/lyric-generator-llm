"Suzanne"

Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river 
You can hear the boats go by 
You can spend the night beside her 
And you know that she's half crazy 
But that's why you want to be there 
And she feeds you tea and oranges 
That come all the way from China 
And just when you mean to tell her 
That you have no love to give her 
Then she gets you on her wavelength 
And she lets the river answer 
That you've always been her lover 
And you want to travel with her 
And you want to travel blind 
And you know that she will trust you 
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind. 
And Jesus was a sailor 
When he walked upon the water 
And he spent a long time watching 
From his lonely wooden tower 
And when he knew for certain 
Only drowning men could see him 
He said "All men will be sailors then 
Until the sea shall free them" 
But he himself was broken 
Long before the sky would open 
Forsaken, almost human 
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone 
And you want to travel with him 
And you want to travel blind 
And you think maybe you'll trust him 
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind. 

Now Suzanne takes your hand 
And she leads you to the river 
She is wearing rags and feathers 
From Salvation Army counters 
And the sun pours down like honey 
On our lady of the harbour 
And she shows you where to look 
Among the garbage and the flowers 
There are heroes in the seaweed 
There are children in the morning 
They are leaning out for love 
And they will lean that way forever 
While Suzanne holds the mirror 
And you want to travel with her 
And you want to travel blind 
And you know that you can trust her 
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind.

"Master Song"

I believe that you heard your master sing 
when I was sick in bed. 
I suppose that he told you everything 
that I keep locked away in my head. 
Your master took you travelling, 
well at least that's what you said. 
And now do you come back to bring 
your prisoner wine and bread? 
You met him at some temple, where 
they take your clothes at the door. 
He was just a numberless man in a chair 
who'd just come back from the war. 
And you wrap up his tired face in your hair 
and he hands you the apple core. 
Then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare 
of all the kisses we put on some time before. 

And he gave you a German Shepherd to walk 
with a collar of leather and nails, 
and he never once made you explain or talk 
about all of the little details, 
such as who had a word and who had a rock, 
and who had you through the mails. 
Now your love is a secret all over the block, 
and it never stops not even when your master fails. 

And he took you up in his aeroplane, 
which he flew without any hands, 
and you cruised above the ribbons of rain 
that drove the crowd from the stands. 
Then he killed the lights in a lonely Lane 
and, an ape with angel glands, 
erased the final wisps of pain 
with the music of rubber bands. 

And now I hear your master sing, 
you kneel for him to come. 
His body is a golden string 
that your body is hanging from. 
His body is a golden string, 
my body has grown numb. 
Oh now you hear your master sing, 
your shirt is all undone. 

And will you kneel beside this bed 
that we polished so long ago, 
before your master chose instead 
to make my bed of snow? 
Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red 
and you're speaking far too low. 
No I can't make out what your master said 
before he made you go. 

Then I think you're playing far too rough 
for a lady who's been to the moon; 
I've lain by this window long enough 
to get used to an empty room. 
And your love is some dust in an old man's cough 
who is tapping his foot to a tune, 
and your thighs are a ruin, you want too much, 
let's say you came back some time too soon. 

I loved your master perfectly 
I taught him all that he knew. 
He was starving in some deep mystery 
like a man who is sure what is true. 
And I sent you to him with my guarantee 
I could teach him something new, 
and I taught him how you would long for me 
no matter what he said no matter what you'd do. 

I believe that you heard your master sing 
while I was sick in bed, 
I'm sure that he told you everything 
I must keep locked away in my head. 
Your master took you travelling, 
well at least that's what you said, 
And now do you come back to bring 
your prisoner wine and bread?

"Winter Lady"

Trav'ling lady, stay awhile 
until the night is over. 
I'm just a station on your way, 
I know I'm not your lover. 
Well I lived with a child of snow 
when I was a soldier, 
and I fought every man for her 
until the nights grew colder. 

She used to wear her hair like you 
except when she was sleeping, 
and then she'd weave it on a loom 
of smoke and gold and breathing. 

And why are you so quiet now 
standing there in the doorway? 
You chose your journey long before 
you came upon this highway. 

Trav'ling lady stay awhile 
until the night is over. 
I'm just a station on your way, 
I know I'm not your lover.

"Stranger Song"

It's true that all the men you knew were dealers
Who said they were through with dealing
Every time you gave them shelter
I know that kind of man
It's hard to hold the hand of anyone
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much
Not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card
That is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger

And then leaning on your window sill
He'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet
An old schedule of trains, he'll say
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger

But now another stranger seems
To want you to ignore his dreams
As though they were the burden of some other
Oh, you've seen that man before
His golden arm dispatching cards
But now it's rusted from the elbow to the finger
And he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter
Yes, he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter

Ah, you hate to watch another tired man
Lay down his hand
Like he was giving up the holy game of poker
And while he talks his dreams to sleep
You notice there's a highway
That is curling up like smoke above his shoulder
It's curling just like smoke above his shoulder

You tell him to come in, sit down
But something makes you turn around
The door is open, you can't close your shelter
You try the handle of the road
It opens, do not be afraid
It's you my love, you who are the stranger
It is you my love, you who are the stranger

Well, I've been waiting, I was sure
We'd meet between the trains we're waiting for
I think it's time to board another
Please understand, I never had a secret chart
To get me to the heart of this
Or any other matter
While he talks like this, you don't know what he's after
When he speaks like this, you don't know what he's after

Let's meet tomorrow if you choose
Upon the shore, beneath the bridge
That they are building on some endless river
Then he leaves the platform
For the sleeping car that's warm
You realize, he's only advertising one more shelter
And it comes to you, he never was a stranger
And you say, "OK, the bridge or some place later."

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much
Not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card
That is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger

And leaning on your window sill
He'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet
An old schedule of trains, he'll say
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger

"Sisters Of Mercy"

Oh the sisters of mercy, they are not departed or gone. 
They were waiting for me when I thought that I just can't go on. 
And they brought me their comfort and later they brought me this song. 
Oh I hope you run into them, you who've been travelling so long. 
Yes you who must leave everything that you cannot control. 
It begins with your family, but soon it comes around to your soul. 
Well I've been where you're hanging, I think I can see how you're pinned: 
When you're not feeling holy, your loneliness says that you've sinned. 

Well they lay down beside me, I made my confession to them. 
They touched both my eyes and I touched the dew on their hem. 
If your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn 
they will bind you with love that is graceful and green as a stem. 

When I left they were sleeping, I hope you run into them soon. 
Don't turn on the lights, you can read their address by the moon. 
And you won't make me jealous if I hear that they sweetened your night: 
We weren't lovers like that and besides it would still be all right, 
We weren't lovers like that and besides it would still be all right.

"So Long Marianne"

Come over to the window, my little darling, 
I'd like to try to read your palm. 
I used to think I was some kind of Gypsy boy 
before I let you take me home. 
Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began 
to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again. 

Well you know that I love to live with you, 
but you make me forget so very much. 
I forget to pray for the angels 
and then the angels forget to pray for us. 

Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ... 

We met when we were almost young 
deep in the green lilac park. 
You held on to me like I was a crucifix, 
as we went kneeling through the dark. 

Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ... 

Your letters they all say that you're beside me now. 
Then why do I feel alone? 
I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web 
is fastening my ankle to a stone. 

Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ... 

For now I need your hidden love. 
I'm cold as a new razor blade. 
You left when I told you I was curious, 
I never said that I was brave. 

Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ... 

Oh, you are really such a pretty one. 
I see you've gone and changed your name again. 
And just when I climbed this whole mountainside, 
to wash my eyelids in the rain! 

Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ...

"Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye"

I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm, 
your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm, 
yes, many loved before us, I know that we are not new, 
in city and in forest they smiled like me and you, 
but now it's come to distances and both of us must try, 
your eyes are soft with sorrow, 
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye. 
I'm not looking for another as I wander in my time, 
walk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme 
you know my love goes with you as your love stays with me, 
it's just the way it changes, like the shoreline and the sea, 
but let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie, 
your eyes are soft with sorrow, 
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye. 

I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm, 
your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm, 
yes many loved before us, I know that we are not new, 
in city and in forest they smiled like me and you, 
but let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie, 
your eyes are soft with sorrow, 
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye.

"Stories Of The Street"

The stories of the street are mine,the Spanish voices laugh. 
The Cadillacs go creeping now through the night and the poison gas, 
and I lean from my window sill in this old hotel I chose, 
yes one hand on my suicide, one hand on the rose. 
I know you've heard it's over now and war must surely come, 
the cities they are broke in half and the middle men are gone. 
But let me ask you one more time, O children of the dusk, 
All these hunters who are shrieking now oh do they speak for us? 

And where do all these highways go, now that we are free? 
Why are the armies marching still that were coming home to me? 
O lady with your legs so fine O stranger at your wheel, 
You are locked into your suffering and your pleasures are the seal. 

The age of lust is giving birth, and both the parents ask 
the nurse to tell them fairy tales on both sides of the glass. 
And now the infant with his cord is hauled in like a kite, 
and one eye filled with blueprints, one eye filled with night. 

O come with me my little one, we will find that farm 
and grow us grass and apples there and keep all the animals warm. 
And if by chance I wake at night and I ask you who I am, 
O take me to the slaughterhouse, I will wait there with the lamb. 

With one hand on the hexagram and one hand on the girl 
I balance on a wishing well that all men call the world. 
We are so small between the stars, so large against the sky, 
and lost among the subway crowds I try to catch your eye.

"Teachers"

I met a woman long ago 
her hair the black that black can go, 
Are you a teacher of the heart? 
Soft she answered no. 
I met a girl across the sea, 
her hair the gold that gold can be, 
Are you a teacher of the heart? 
Yes, but not for thee. 

I met a man who lost his mind 
in some lost place I had to find, 
follow me the wise man said, 
but he walked behind. 

I walked into a hospital 
where none was sick and none was well, 
when at night the nurses left 
I could not walk at all. 

Morning came and then came noon, 
dinner time a scalpel blade 
lay beside my silver spoon. 

Some girls wander by mistake 
into the mess that scalpels make. 
Are you the teachers of my heart? 
We teach old hearts to break. 

One morning I woke up alone, 
the hospital and the nurses gone. 
Have I carved enough my Lord? 
Child, you are a bone. 

I ate and ate and ate, 
no I did not miss a plate, well 
How much do these suppers cost? 
We'll take it out in hate. 

I spent my hatred everyplace, 
on every work on every face, 
someone gave me wishes 
and I wished for an embrace. 

Several girls embraced me, then 
I was embraced by men, 
Is my passion perfect? 
No, do it once again. 

I was handsome I was strong, 
I knew the words of every song. 
Did my singing please you? 
No, the words you sang were wrong. 

Who is it whom I address, 
who takes down what I confess? 
Are you the teachers of my heart? 
We teach old hearts to rest. 

Oh teachers are my lessons done? 
I cannot do another one. 
They laughed and laughed and said, Well child, 
are your lessons done? 
are your lessons done? 
are your lessons done?

"One Of Us Cannot Be Wrong"

I lit a thin green candle, to make you jealous of me. 
But the room just filled up with mosquitos, 
they heard that my body was free. 
Then I took the dust of a long sleepless night 
and I put it in your little shoe. 
And then I confess that I tortured the dress 
that you wore for the world to look through. 
I showed my heart to the doctor: he said I just have to quit. 
Then he wrote himself a prescription, 
and your name was mentioned in it! 
Then he locked himself in a library shelf 
with the details of our honeymoon, 
and I hear from the nurse that he's gotten much worse 
and his practice is all in a ruin. 

I heard of a saint who had loved you, 
so I studied all night in his school. 
He taught that the duty of lovers 
is to tarnish the golden rule. 
And just when I was sure that his teachings were pure 
he drowned himself in the pool. 
His body is gone but back here on the lawn 
his spirit continues to drool. 

An Eskimo showed me a movie 
he'd recently taken of you: 
the poor man could hardly stop shivering, 
his lips and his fingers were blue. 
I suppose that he froze when the wind took your clothes 
and I guess he just never got warm. 
But you stand there so nice, in your blizzard of ice, 
oh please let me come into the storm.

"Store Room"

It's not the wind that keeps you up, it's not the snow
It's not the moon coming like a headlight through your window
It's not the thumbnail of a screen that scrapes away your dream
It's just this man taking what he needs from the store room

It's not the news of burning towns that ruins your mind
Like a spool you turn and you turn but it won't unwind
No these wars you did not start, they don't tear your sleep apart
It's just a man taking what he needs from the store room

And now this woman by your side, well, she's asleep
And there's nothing you can give her and there's nothing you want to keep
You don't even try to prove that the noise is neighbors making love
It's just a man taking what he needs from the store room

Well go to sleep and change the locks when you wake up
Share your toast, maybe spill some coffee from your cup
Oh, there's nothing left to choose and there is so much more to lose
There's this man taking what he needs from the store room

It's not the wind that keeps you up, it's not the snow
It's not the moon coming like a headlight through your window
It's not the thumbnail of a screen that scrapes away your dream
It's just a man taking what he needs from the store room

It's not the news of burning towns that ruins your mind
Like a spool you turn and turn but won't unwind
No these wars you did not start, they don't tear your sleep apart
It's just a man taking what he needs from the store room

And now the woman by your side, well, she's awake
But there's nothing you can give her and there's nothing you want to take
You don't even try to prove that the noise is neighbors making love
It's just a man taking what he needs from the store room

Or go to sleep and change the locks when you wake up
Share your toast, maybe spill a little coffee from your cup
He's got nothing left to choose and you've got so much more to lose
There's just a man taking what he needs from the store room

It's not the wind

"Blessed Is The Memory"

I remember the promise
That you made in the barn
When the kittens were born
And you could not keep warm

So you moved away the mountain
That the sun rose behind
And you said yourself a prayer
And laid down with the blind

But you lost them in your freedom
And you need him now, you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

And the vow of compassion
That you swore through your teeth
When the war began to end
And the photographs weep

Well, nobody blames you
As the train pulls away
With its cargo of snow
For these German paper-weights

But you lost them in your freedom
And you need him now, you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

Well, its five in the morning
There's no one at home
Except for your wife
And your child on the phone

Somebody's got to listen
To a promise or two
Oh, this room is far too small
For a pilgrim like you

But you lost them in your freedom
And you need him now, you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

So, now that you've decided
To follow the sun
Like a shadow of birds
Or a king on the run

Oh, your chains are too dark
For the seas you must swim
You are smiling at the seaweed
But your smile is too grim

But you lost them in your freedom
And you need him now, you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

"Bird On The Wire"

Like a bird on the wire, 
like a drunk in a midnight choir 
I have tried in my way to be free. 
Like a worm on a hook, 
like a knight from some old fashioned book 
I have saved all my ribbons for thee. 
If I, if I have been unkind, 
I hope that you can just let it go by. 
If I, if I have been untrue 
I hope you know it was never to you. 
Like a baby, stillborn, 
like a beast with his horn 
I have torn everyone who reached out for me. 
But I swear by this song 
and by all that I have done wrong 
I will make it all up to thee. 
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch, 
he said to me, "You must not ask for so much." 
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door, 
she cried to me, "Hey, why not ask for more?" 

Oh like a bird on the wire, 
like a drunk in a midnight choir 
I have tried in my way to be free.

"Story Of Isaac"

The door it opened slowly, 
my father he came in, 
I was nine years old. 
And he stood so tall above me, 
his blue eyes they were shining 
and his voice was very cold. 
He said, "I've had a vision 
and you know I'm strong and holy, 
I must do what I've been told." 
So he started up the mountain, 
I was running, he was walking, 
and his axe was made of gold. 
Well, the trees they got much smaller, 
the lake a lady's mirror, 
we stopped to drink some wine. 
Then he threw the bottle over. 
Broke a minute later 
and he put his hand on mine. 
Thought I saw an eagle 
but it might have been a vulture, 
I never could decide. 
Then my father built an altar, 
he looked once behind his shoulder, 
he knew I would not hide. 

You who build these altars now 
to sacrifice these children, 
you must not do it anymore. 
A scheme is not a vision 
and you never have been tempted 
by a demon or a god. 
You who stand above them now, 
your hatchets blunt and bloody, 
you were not there before, 
when I lay upon a mountain 
and my father's hand was trembling 
with the beauty of the word. 

And if you call me brother now, 
forgive me if I inquire, 
"Just according to whose plan?" 
When it all comes down to dust 
I will kill you if I must, 
I will help you if I can. 
When it all comes down to dust 
I will help you if I must, 
I will kill you if I can. 
And mercy on our uniform, 
man of peace or man of war, 
the peacock spreads his fan.

"A Bunch Of Lonesome Heroes"

A bunch of lonesome and very quarrelsome heroes 
were smoking out along the open road; 
the night was very dark and thick between them, 
each man beneath his ordinary load. 
"I'd like to tell my story," 
said one of them so young and bold, 
"I'd like to tell my story, 
before I turn into gold." 
But no one really could hear him, 
the night so dark and thick and green; 
well I guess that these heroes must always live there 
where you and I have only been. 
Put out your cigarette, my love, 
you've been alone too long; 
and some of us are very hungry now 
to hear what it is you've done that was so wrong. 

I sing this for the crickets, 
I sing this for the army, 
I sing this for your children 
and for all who do not need me. 
"I'd like to tell my story," 
said one of them so bold, 
"Oh yes, I'd like to tell my story 
'cause you know I feel I'm turning into gold."

"The Partisan"

When they poured across the border
I was cautioned to surrender,
this I could not do;
I took my gun and vanished.
I have changed my name so often,
I've lost my wife and children
but I have many friends,
and some of them are with me.

An old woman gave us shelter,
kept us hidden in the garret,
then the soldiers came;
she died without a whisper.

There were three of us this morning
I'm the only one this evening
but I must go on;
the frontiers are my prison.

Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing,
through the graves the wind is blowing,
freedom soon will come;
then we'll come from the shadows.

Les Allemands Ã©taient chez moi (The Germans were at my home)
ils m'ont dit "RÃ©signe-toi" (They said, "Surrender,")
mais je n'ai pas pu (this I could not do)
j'ai repris mon arme (I took my weapon again)

J'ai changÃ© cent fois de nom (I have changed names a hundred times)
j'ai perdu femme et enfants (I have lost wife and children)
mais j'ai tant d'amis (But I have so many friends)
j'ai la France entiÃ¨re (I have all of France)

Un vieil homme dans un grenier (An old man, in an attic)
pour la nuit nous a cachÃ©s (Hid us for the night)
les Allemands l'ont pris (The Germans captured him)
il est mort sans surprise (He died without surprise)

Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing,
through the graves the wind is blowing,
freedom soon will come;
then we'll come from the shadows.

"Seems So Long Ago, Nancy"

It seems so long ago, 
Nancy was alone, 
looking ate the Late Late show 
through a semi-precious stone. 
In the House of Honesty 
her father was on trial, 
in the House of Mystery 
there was no one at all, 
there was no one at all. 
It seems so long ago, 
none of us were strong; 
Nancy wore green stockings 
and she slept with everyone. 
She never said she'd wait for us 
although she was alone, 
I think she fell in love for us 
in nineteen sixty one, 
in nineteen sixty one. 

It seems so long ago, 
Nancy was alone, 
a forty five beside her head, 
an open telephone. 
We told her she was beautiful, 
we told her she was free 
but none of us would meet her in 
the House of Mystery, 
the House of Mystery. 

And now you look around you, 
see her everywhere, 
many use her body, 
many comb her hair. 
In the hollow of the night 
when you are cold and numb 
you hear her talking freely then, 
she's happy that you've come, 
she's happy that you've come.

"The Old Revolution"

I finally broke into the prison, 
I found my place in the chain. 
Even damnation is poisoned with rainbows, 
all the brave young men 
they're waiting now to see a signal 
which some killer will be lighting for pay. 
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture, 
you whom I cannot betray. 

I fought in the old revolution 
on the side of the ghost and the King. 
Of course I was very young 
and I thought that we were winning; 
I can't pretend I still feel very much like singing 
as they carry the bodies away. 

Into this furnace I ask you now to venture... 

Lately you've started to stutter 
as though you had nothing to say. 
To all of my architects let me be traitor. 
Now let me say I myself gave the order 
to sleep and to search and to destroy. 

Into this furnace I ask you now to venture... 

Yes, you who are broken by power, 
you who are absent all day, 
you who are kings for the sake of your children's story, 
the hand of your beggar is burdened down with money, 
the hand of your lover is clay. 

Into this furnace I ask you now to venture...

"The Butcher"

I came upon a butcher, 
he was slaughtering a lamb, 
I accused him there 
with his tortured lamb. 
He said, "Listen to me, child, 
I am what I am 
and you, you are my only son." 
Well, I found a silver needle, 
I put it into my arm. 
It did some good, 
did some harm. 
But the nights were cold 
and it almost kept me warm, 
how come the night is long? 

I saw some flowers growing up 
where that lamb fell down; 
was I supposed to praise my Lord, 
make some kind of joyful sound? 
He said, "Listen, listen to me now, 
I go round and round 
and you, you are my only child." 

Do not leave me now, 
do not leave me now, 
I'm broken down 
from a recent fall. 
Blood upon my body 
and ice upon my soul, 
lead on, my son, it is your world.

"You Know Who I Am"

I cannot follow you, my love, 
you cannot follow me. 
I am the distance you put between 
all of the moments that we will be. 
You know who I am, 
you've stared at the sun, 
well I am the one who loves 
changing from nothing to one. 

Sometimes I need you naked, 
sometimes I need you wild, 
I need you to carry my children in 
and I need you to kill a child. 

You know who I am... 

If you should ever track me down 
I will surrender there 
and I will leave with you one broken man 
whom I will teach you to repair. 

You know who I am... 

I cannot follow you, my love, 
you cannot follow me. 
I am the distance you put between 
all of the moments that we will be. 

You know who I am...

"Lady Midnight"

I came by myself to a very crowded place; 
I was looking for someone who had lines in her face. 
I found her there but she was past all concern; 
I asked her to hold me, I said, "Lady, unfold me," 
but she scorned me and she told me 
I was dead and I could never return. 
Well, I argued all night like so many have before, 
saying, "Whatever you give me, I seem to need so much more." 
Then she pointed at me where I kneeled on her floor, 
she said, "Don't try to use me or slyly refuse me, 
just win me or lose me, 
it is this that the darkness is for." 

I cried, "Oh, Lady Midnight, I fear that you grow old, 
the stars eat your body and the wind makes you cold." 
"If we cry now," she said, "it will just be ignored." 
So I walked through the morning, sweet early morning, 
I could hear my lady calling, 
"You've won me, you've won me, my lord, 
you've won me, you've won me, my lord, 
yes, you've won me, you've won me, my lord, 
ah, you've won me, you've won me, my lord, 
ah, you've won me, you've won me, my lord."

"Tonight Will Be Fine"

Sometimes I find I get to thinking of the past. 
We swore to each other then that our love would surely last. 
You kept right on loving, I went on a fast, 
now I am too thin and your love is too vast. 
But I know from your eyes 
and I know from your smile 
that tonight will be fine, 
will be fine, will be fine, will be fine 
for a while. 

I choose the rooms that I live in with care, 
the windows are small and the walls almost bare, 
there's only one bed and there's only one prayer; 
I listen all night for your step on the stair. 

But I know from your eyes 
and I know from your smile 
that tonight will be fine, 
will be fine, will be fine, will be fine 
for a while. 

Oh sometimes I see her undressing for me, 
she's the soft naked lady love meant her to be 
and she's moving her body so brave and so free. 
If I've got to remember that's a fine memory. 

And I know from her eyes 
and I know from her smile 
that tonight will be fine, 
will be fine, will be fine, will be fine 
for a while.

"Avalanche"

Well I stepped into an avalanche, 
it covered up my soul; 
when I am not this hunchback that you see, 
I sleep beneath the golden hill. 
You who wish to conquer pain, 
you must learn, learn to serve me well. 
You strike my side by accident 
as you go down for your gold. 
The cripple here that you clothe and feed 
is neither starved nor cold; 
he does not ask for your company, 
not at the centre, the centre of the world. 

When I am on a pedestal, 
you did not raise me there. 
Your laws do not compel me 
to kneel grotesque and bare. 
I myself am the pedestal 
for this ugly hump at which you stare. 

You who wish to conquer pain, 
you must learn what makes me kind; 
the crumbs of love that you offer me, 
they're the crumbs I've left behind. 
Your pain is no credential here, 
it's just the shadow, shadow of my wound. 

I have begun to long for you, 
I who have no greed; 
I have begun to ask for you, 
I who have no need. 
You say you've gone away from me, 
but I can feel you when you breathe. 

Do not dress in those rags for me, 
I know you are not poor; 
you don't love me quite so fiercely now 
when you know that you are not sure, 
it is your turn, beloved, 
it is your flesh that I wear.

"Last Year's Man"

The rain falls down on last year's man
That's a Jew's harp on the table
That's a crayon in his hand
And the corners of the blueprint are ruined since they rolled
Far past the stems of thumbtacks
That still throw shadows on the wood
And the skylight is like skin for a drum I'll never mend
And all the rain falls down amen
On the works of last year's man
I met a lady, she was playing with her soldiers in the dark
Oh one by one she had to tell them
That her name was Joan of Arc
I was in that army, yes I stayed a little while
I want to thank you, Joan of Arc
For treating me so well
And though I wear a uniform I was not born to fight
All these wounded boys you lie beside
Goodnight, my friends, goodnight

I came upon a wedding that old families had contrived
Bethlehem the bridegroom
Babylon the bride
Great Babylon was naked, oh she stood there trembling for me
And Bethlehem inflamed us both
Like the shy one at some orgy
And when we fell together all our flesh was like a veil
That I had to draw aside to see
The serpent eat its tail

Some women wait for Jesus, and some women wait for Cain
So I hang upon my altar
And I hoist my axe again
And I take the one who finds me back to where it all began
When Jesus was the honeymoon
And Cain was just the man
And we read from pleasant Bibles that are bound in blood and skin
That the wilderness is gathering
All its children back again

The rain falls down on last year's man
An hour has gone by
And he has not moved his hand
But everything will happen if he only gives the word
The lovers will rise up
And the mountains touch the ground
But the skylight is like skin for a drum I'll never mend
And all the rain falls down amen
On the works of last year's man

"Dress Rehearsal Rag"

Four o'clock in the afternoon 
and I didn't feel like very much. 
I said to myself, "Where are you golden boy, 
where is your famous golden touch?" 
I thought you knew where 
all of the elephants lie down, 
I thought you were the crown prince 
of all the wheels in Ivory Town. 
Just take a look at your body now, 
there's nothing much to save 
and a bitter voice in the mirror cries, 
"Hey, Prince, you need a shave." 
Now if you can manage to get 
your trembling fingers to behave, 
why don't you try unwrapping 
a stainless steel razor blade? 
That's right, it's come to this, 
yes it's come to this, 
and wasn't it a long way down, 
wasn't it a strange way down? 
There's no hot water 
and the cold is running thin. 
Well, what do you expect from 
the kind of places you've been living in? 
Don't drink from that cup, 
it's all caked and cracked along the rim. 
That's not the electric light, my friend, 
that is your vision growing dim. 
Cover up your face with soap, there, 
now you're Santa Claus. 
And you've got a gift for anyone 
who will give you his applause. 
I thought you were a racing man, 
ah, but you couldn't take the pace. 
That's a funeral in the mirror 
and it's stopping at your face. 
That's right, it's come to this, 
yes it's come to this, 
and wasn't it a long way down, 
ah wasn't it a strange way down? 

Once there was a path 
and a girl with chestnut hair, 
and you passed the summers 
picking all of the berries that grew there; 
there were times she was a woman, 
oh, there were times she was just a child, 
and you held her in the shadows 
where the raspberries grow wild. 
And you climbed the twilight mountains 
and you sang about the view, 
and everywhere that you wandered 
love seemed to go along with you. 
That's a hard one to remember, 
yes it makes you clench your fist. 
And then the veins stand out like highways, 
all along your wrist. 
And yes it's come to this, 
it's come to this, 
and wasn't it a long way down, 
wasn't it a strange way down? 

You can still find a job, 
go out and talk to a friend. 
On the back of every magazine 
there are those coupons you can send. 
Why don't you join the Rosicrucians, 
they can give you back your hope, 
you can find your love with diagrams 
on a plain brown envelope. 
But you've used up all your coupons 
except the one that seems 
to be written on your wrist 
along with several thousand dreams. 
Now Santa Claus comes forward, 
that's a razor in his mit; 
and he puts on his dark glasses 
and he shows you where to hit; 
and then the cameras pan, 
the stand in stunt man, 
dress rehearsal rag, 
it's just the dress rehearsal rag, 
you know this dress rehearsal rag, 
it's just a dress rehearsal rag.

"Diamonds In The Mine"

The woman in blue, she's asking for revenge, 
the man in white -- that's you -- says he has no friends. 
The river is swollen up with rusty cans 
and the trees are burning in your promised land. 
And there are no letters in the mailbox, 
and there are no grapes upon the vine, 
and there are no chocolates in the boxes anymore, 
and there are no diamonds in the mine. 

Well, you tell me that your lover has a broken limb, 
you say you're kind of restless now and it's on account of him. 
Well, I saw the man in question, it was just the other night, 
he was eating up a lady where the lions and Christians fight. 

And there are no letters in the mailbox 
and there are no grapes upon the vine, 
and there are no chocolates in the boxes anymore, 
and there are no diamonds in the mine. 

(You tell them now) 

Ah, there is no comfort in the covens of the witch, 
some very clever doctor went and sterilized the bitch, 
and the only man of energy, yes the revolution's pride, 
he trained a hundred women just to kill an unborn child. 

And there are no letters in the mailbox, 
oh no, there are no, no grapes upon your vine, 
and there are, there are no chocolates in your boxes anymore, 
and there are no diamonds in your mine. 
And there are no letters in the mailbox, 
and there are no grapes upon the vine, 
and there are no chocolates in your boxes anymore, 
and there are no diamonds in your mine.

"Love Calls You By Your Name"

You thought that it could never happen 
to all the people that you became, 
your body lost in legend, the beast so very tame. 
But here, right here, 
between the birthmark and the stain, 
between the ocean and your open vein, 
between the snowman and the rain, 
once again, once again, 
love calls you by your name. 
The women in your scrapbook 
whom you still praise and blame, 
you say they chained you to your fingernails 
and you climb the halls of fame. 
Oh but here, right here, 
between the peanuts and the cage, 
between the darkness and the stage, 
between the hour and the age, 
once again, once again, 
love calls you by your name. 

Shouldering your loneliness 
like a gun that you will not learn to aim, 
you stumble into this movie house, 
then you climb, you climb into the frame. 
Yes, and here, right here 
between the moonlight and the lane, 
between the tunnel and the train, 
between the victim and his stain, 
once again, once again, 
love calls you by your name. 

I leave the lady meditating 
on the very love which I, I do not wish to claim, 
I journey down the hundred steps, 
but the street is still the very same. 
And here, right here, 
between the dancer and his cane, 
between the sailboat and the drain, 
between the newsreel and your tiny pain, 
once again, once again, 
love calls you by your name. 

Where are you, Judy, where are you, Anne? 
Where are the paths your heroes came? 
Wondering out loud as the bandage pulls away, 
was I, was I only limping, was I really lame? 
Oh here, come over here, 
between the windmill and the grain, 
between the sundial and the chain, 
between the traitor and her pain, 
once again, once again, 
love calls you by your name.

"Famous Blue Raincoat"

It's four in the morning, the end of December 
I'm writing you now just to see if you're better 
New York is cold, but I like where I'm living 
There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening. 
I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert 
You're living for nothing now, I hope you're keeping some kind of record. 

Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair 
She said that you gave it to her 
That night that you planned to go clear 
Did you ever go clear? 

Ah, the last time we saw you you looked so much older 
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder 
You'd been to the station to meet every train 
And you came home without Lili Marlene 

And you treated my woman to a flake of your life 
And when she came back she was nobody's wife. 

Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth 
One more thin gypsy thief 
Well I see Jane's awake -- 

She sends her regards. 

And what can I tell you my brother, my killer 
What can I possibly say? 
I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you 
I'm glad you stood in my way. 

If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me 
Your enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free. 

Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes 
I thought it was there for good so I never tried. 

And Jane came by with a lock of your hair 
She said that you gave it to her 
That night that you planned to go clear -- 

Sincerely, L. Cohen

"Sing Another Song, Boys"

(Let's sing another song, boys, this one has grown old and bitter.) 
Ah his fingernails, I see they're broken, 
his ships they're all on fire. 
The moneylender's lovely little daughter 
ah, she's eaten, she's eaten with desire. 
She spies him through the glasses 
from the pawnshops of her wicked father. 
She hails him with a microphone 
that some poor singer, just like me, had to leave her. 
She tempts him with a clarinet, 
she waves a Nazi dagger. 
She finds him lying in a heap; 
she wants to be his woman. 
He says, "Yes, I might go to sleep 
but kindly leave, leave the future, 
leave it open." 

He stands where it is steep, 
oh I guess he thinks that he's the very first one, 
his hand upon his leather belt now 
like it was the wheel of some big ocean liner. 
And she will learn to touch herself so well 
as all the sails burn down like paper. 
And he has lit the chain 
of his famous cigarillo. 
Ah, they'll never, they'll never ever reach the moon, 
at least not the one that we're after; 
it's floating broken on the open sea, look out there, my friends, 
and it carries no survivors. 
But lets leave these lovers wondering 
why they cannot have each other, 
and let's sing another song, boys, 
this one has grown old and bitter.

"Joan Of Arc"

Now the flames they followed Joan of Arc 
as she came riding through the dark; 
no moon to keep her armour bright, 
no man to get her through this very smoky night. 
She said, "I'm tired of the war, 
I want the kind of work I had before, 
a wedding dress or something white 
to wear upon my swollen appetite." 
Well, I'm glad to hear you talk this way, 
you know I've watched you riding every day 
and something in me yearns to win 
such a cold and lonesome heroine. 
"And who are you?" she sternly spoke 
to the one beneath the smoke. 
"Why, I'm fire," he replied, 
"And I love your solitude, I love your pride." 

"Then fire, make your body cold, 
I'm going to give you mine to hold," 
saying this she climbed inside 
to be his one, to be his only bride. 
And deep into his fiery heart 
he took the dust of Joan of Arc, 
and high above the wedding guests 
he hung the ashes of her wedding dress. 

It was deep into his fiery heart 
he took the dust of Joan of Arc, 
and then she clearly understood 
if he was fire, oh then she must be wood. 
I saw her wince, I saw her cry, 
I saw the glory in her eye. 
Myself I long for love and light, 
but must it come so cruel, and oh so bright?

"Is This What You Wanted"

You were the promise at dawn, 
I was the morning after. 
You were Jesus Christ my Lord, 
I was the money lender. 
You were the sensitive woman, 
I was the very reverend Freud. 
You were the manual orgasm, 
I was the dirty little boy. 
And is this what you wanted 
to live in a house that is haunted 
by the ghost of you and me? 

Is this what you wanted ... 

You were Marlon Brando, 
I was Steve McQueen. 
You were K.Y. Jelly, 
I was Vaseline. 
You were the father of modern medicine, 
I was Mr. Clean. 
You where the whore and the beast of Babylon, 
I was Rin Tin Tin. 

And is this what you wanted ... 

And is this what you wanted ... 

You got old and wrinkled, 
I stayed seventeen. 
You lusted after so many, 
I lay here with one. 
You defied your solitude, 
I came through alone. 
You said you could never love me, 
I undid your gown. 

And is this what you wanted ... 

And is this what you wanted ... 

I mean is this what you wanted ... 

That's right, is this what you wanted ...

"Chelsea Hotel #2"

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel, 
you were talking so brave and so sweet, 
giving me head on the unmade bed, 
while the limousines wait in the street. 
Those were the reasons and that was New York, 
we were running for the money and the flesh. 
And that was called love for the workers in song 
probably still is for those of them left. 
Ah but you got away, didn't you babe, 
you just turned your back on the crowd, 
you got away, I never once heard you say, 
I need you, I don't need you, 
I need you, I don't need you 
and all of that jiving around. 

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel 
you were famous, your heart was a legend. 
You told me again you preferred handsome men 
but for me you would make an exception. 
And clenching your fist for the ones like us 
who are oppressed by the figures of beauty, 
you fixed yourself, you said, "Well never mind, 
we are ugly but we have the music." 

And then you got away, didn't you babe... 

I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best, 
I can't keep track of each fallen robin. 
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel, 
that's all, I don't even think of you that often.

"Lover Lover Lover"

I asked my father, 
I said, "Father change my name." 
The one I'm using now it's covered up 
with fear and filth and cowardice and shame. 
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me, 
yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. 

He said, "I locked you in this body, 
I meant it as a kind of trial. 
You can use it for a weapon, 
or to make some woman smile." 

Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me 
yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. 

"Then let me start again," I cried, 
"please let me start again, 
I want a face that's fair this time, 
I want a spirit that is calm." 

Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me 
yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. 

"I never never turned aside," he said, 
"I never walked away. 
It was you who built the temple, 
it was you who covered up my face." 

Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me 
yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. 

And may the spirit of this song, 
may it rise up pure and free. 
May it be a shield for you, 
a shield against the enemy. 

Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me 
yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. 

Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me 
yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me.

"Field Commander Cohen"

Field Commander Cohen, he was our most important spy. 
Wounded in the line of duty, 
parachuting acid into diplomatic cocktail parties, 
urging Fidel Castro to abandon fields and castles. 
Leave it all and like a man, 
come back to nothing special, 
such as waiting rooms and ticket lines, 
silver bullet suicides, 
and messianic ocean tides, 
and racial roller-coaster rides 
and other forms of boredom advertised as poetry. 
I know you need your sleep now, 
I know your life's been hard. 
But many men are falling, 
where you promised to stand guard. 

I never asked but I heard you cast your lot along with the poor. 
But then I overheard your prayer, 
that you be this and nothing more 
than just some grateful faithful woman's favourite singing millionaire, 
the patron Saint of envy and the grocer of despair, 
working for the Yankee Dollar. 

I know you need your sleep now ... 

Ah, lover come and lie with me, if my lover is who you are, 
and be your sweetest self awhile until I ask for more, my child. 
Then let the other selves be wrong, yeah, let them manifest and come 
till every taste is on the tongue, 
till love is pierced and love is hung, 
and every kind of freedom done, then oh, 
oh my love, oh my love, oh my love, 
oh my love, oh my love, oh my love.

"Why Don't You Try"

Why don't you try to do without him? 
Why don't you try to live alone? 
Do you really need his hands for your passion? 
Do you really need his heart for your throne? 
Do you need his labour for your baby? 
Do you need his beast for the bone? 
Do you need to hold a leash to be a lady? 
I know you're going to make, make it on your own. 
Why don't your try to forget him? 
Just open up your dainty little hand. 
You know this life is filled with many sweet companions, 
many satisfying one-night stands. 
Do you want to be the ditch around a tower? 
Do you want to be the moonlight in his cave? 
Do you want to give your blessing to his power 
as he goes whistling past his daddy, past his daddy's grave. 

I'd like to take you take you to the ceremony, 
well, that is if I remember the way. 
You see Jack and Jill they're going to join their misery, 
I'm afraid it's time for everyone to pray. 
You can see they've finally taken cover, 
they're willing, yeah they're willing to obey. 
Their vows are difficult, they're for each other, 
so let nobody put a loophole, a loophole in their way.

"There Is A War"

There is a war between the rich and poor, 
a war between the man and the woman. 
There is a war between the ones who say there is a war 
and the ones who say there isn't. 
Why don't you come on back to the war, that's right, get in it, 
why don't you come on back to the war, it's just beginning. 

Well I live here with a woman and a child, 
the situation makes me kind of nervous. 
Yes, I rise up from her arms, she says "I guess you call this love"; 
I call it service. 

Why don't you come on back to the war, don't be a tourist, 
why don't you come on back to the war, before it hurts us, 
why don't you come on back to the war, let's all get nervous. 

You cannot stand what I've become, 
you much prefer the gentleman I was before. 
I was so easy to defeat, I was so easy to control, 
I didn't even know there was a war. 

Why don't you come on back to the war, don't be embarrassed, 
why don't you come on back to the war, you can still get married. 

There is a war between the rich and poor, 
a war between the man and the woman. 
There is a war between the left and right, 
a war between the black and white, 
a war between the odd and the even. 

Why don't you come on back to the war, pick up your tiny burden, 
why don't you come on back to the war, let's all get even, 
why don't you come on back to the war, can't you hear me speaking?

"A Singer Must Die"

Now the courtroom is quiet, but who will confess. 
Is it true you betrayed us? The answer is Yes. 
Then read me the list of the crimes that are mine, 
I will ask for the mercy that you love to decline. 
And all the ladies go moist, and the judge has no choice, 
a singer must die for the lie in his voice. 
And I thank you, I thank you for doing your duty, 
you keepers of truth, you guardians of beauty. 
Your vision is right, my vision is wrong, 
I'm sorry for smudging the air with my song. 

Oh, the night it is thick, my defences are hid 
in the clothes of a woman I would like to forgive, 
in the rings of her silk, in the hinge of her thighs, 
where I have to go begging in beauty's disguise. 
Oh goodnight, goodnight, my night after night, 
my night after night, after night, after night, after night, after night. 

I am so afraid that I listen to you, 
your sun glassed protectors they do that to you. 
It's their ways to detain, their ways to disgrace, 
their knee in your balls and their fist in your face. 
Yes and long live the state by whoever it's made, 
sir, I didn't see nothing, I was just getting home late.

"I Tried To Leave You"

I tried to leave you, I don't deny 
I closed the book on us, at least a hundred times. 
I'd wake up every morning by your side. 
The years go by, you lose your pride. 
The baby's crying, so you do not go outside, 
and all your work it's right before your eyes. 

Goodnight, my darling, I hope you're satisfied, 
the bed is kind of narrow, but my arms are open wide. 
And here's a man still working for your smile.

"Who By Fire"

And who by fire, who by water, 
who in the sunshine, who in the night time, 
who by high ordeal, who by common trial, 
who in your merry merry month of may, 
who by very slow decay, 
and who shall I say is calling? 
And who in her lonely slip, who by barbiturate, 
who in these realms of love, who by something blunt, 
and who by avalanche, who by powder, 
who for his greed, who for his hunger, 
and who shall I say is calling? 

And who by brave assent, who by accident, 
who in solitude, who in this mirror, 
who by his lady's command, who by his own hand, 
who in mortal chains, who in power, 
and who shall I say is calling?

"Take This Longing"

Many men have loved the bells 
you fastened to the rein, 
and everyone who wanted you 
they found what they will always want again. 
Your beauty lost to you yourself 
just as it was lost to them. 
Oh take this longing from my tongue, 
whatever useless things these hands have done. 
Let me see your beauty broken down 
like you would do for one you love. 

Your body like a searchlight 
my poverty revealed, 
I would like to try your charity 
until you cry, "Now you must try my greed." 
And everything depends upon 
how near you sleep to me 

Just take this longing from my tongue 
all the lonely things my hands have done. 
Let me see your beauty broken down 
like you would do for one your love. 

Hungry as an archway 
through which the troops have passed, 
I stand in ruins behind you, 
with your winter clothes, your broken sandal straps. 
I love to see you naked over there 
especially from the back. 

Oh take this longing from my tongue, 
all the useless things my hands have done, 
untie for me your hired blue gown, 
like you would do for one that you love. 

You're faithful to the better man, 
I'm afraid that he left. 
So let me judge your love affair 
in this very room where I have sentenced 
mine to death. 
I'll even wear these old laurel leaves 
that he's shaken from his head. 

Just take this longing from my tongue, 
all the useless things my hands have done, 
let me see your beauty broken down, 
like you would do for one you love. 

Like you would do for one you love.

"Leaving Green Sleeves"

Alas, my love, you did me wrong, 
to cast me out discourteously, 
for I have loved you so long, 
delighting in your very company. 
Now if you intend to show me disdain, 
don't you know it all the more enraptures me, 
for even so I still remain your lover in captivity. 
Green sleeves, you're all alone, 
the leaves have fallen, the men have gone. 
Green sleeves, there's no one home, 
not even the Lady Green Sleeves 

I sang my songs, I told my lies, 
to lie between your matchless thighs. 
And ain't it fine, ain't it wild 
to finally end our exercise 
Then I saw you naked in the early dawn, 
oh, I hoped you would be someone new. 
I reached for you but you were gone, 
so lady I'm going too. 

Green sleeves, you're all alone ... 

Green sleeves, you're all alone, 
the leaves have fallen, the men have all gone home. 
Green sleeves, it's so easily done, 
leaving the Lady Green Sleeves.

"True Love Leaves No Traces"

As the mist leaves no scar 
On the dark green hill 
So my body leaves no scar 
On you and never will 
Through windows in the dark 
The children come, the children go 
Like arrows with no targets 
Like shackles made of snow 

True love leaves no traces 
If you and I are one 
It's lost in our embraces 
Like stars against the sun 

As a falling leaf may rest 
A moment on the air 
So your head upon my breast 
So my hand upon your hair 

And many nights endure 
Without a moon or star 
So we will endure 
When one is gone and far 

True love leaves no traces 
If you and I are one 
It's lost in our embraces 
Like stars against the sun

"Iodine"

I needed you, I knew I was in danger
Of losing what I used to think was mine
You let me love you till I was a failure
You let me love you till I was a failure
Your beauty on my bruise like iodine

I asked you if a man could be forgiven
And though I failed at love, was this a crime?
You said, "Don't worry, don't worry, darling,"
You said, "Don't worry, don't you worry, darling
There are many ways a man can serve his time"

You covered up that place I could not master
It wasn't dark enough to shut my eyes
So I was with you, oh sweet compassion
Yes I was with you, oh sweet compassion
Compassion with the sting of iodine

Your saintly kisses reeked of iodine
Your fragrance with a fume of iodine
And pity in the room like iodine

My masquerade of trust was iodine
And everywhere the flare of iodine
Yes it started with the flare of iodine

"Paper Thin Hotel"

The walls of this hotel are paper-thin 
Last night I heard you making love to him 
The struggle mouth to mouth and limb to limb 
The grunt of unity when he came in 
I stood there with my ear against the wall 
I was not seized by jealousy at all 
In fact a burden lifted from my soul 
I heard that love was out of my control 
A heavy burden lifted from my soul 
I heard that love was out of my control 

I listened to your kisses at the door 
I never heard the world so clear before 
You ran your bath and you began to sing 
I felt so good I couldn't feel a thing 

I stood there with my ear against the wall ... 

And I can't wait to tell you to your face 
And I can't wait for you to take my place 
You are The Naked Angel In My Heart 
You are The Woman With Her Legs Apart 
It's written on the walls of this hotel 
You go to heaven once you've been to hell 

A heavy burden lifted from my soul 
I heard that love was out of my control

"Memories"

Frankie Laine, he was singing Jezebel
I pinned an Iron Cross to my lapel
I walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl
I said, "Look, you don't know me now but very soon you will
So won't you let me see"
I said "won't you let me see"
I said "won't you let me see
Your naked body?"

"Just dance me to the dark side of the gym
Chances are I will let you do most anything
I know you're hungry, I can hear it in your voice
And there are many parts of me to touch, you have your choice
Ah but no you cannot see
She said "No you cannot see"
She said "No you cannot see
My naked body"

So we're dancing close, the band is playing Stardust
The balloons and paper streamers they're floating down on us
She says, "You've got a minute left to fall in love"
In solemn moments such as this I have put my trust
And all my faith to see
I said all my faith to see
I said all my faith to see
Her naked body
Naked body

All my faith...

(...you cheated you lied)

"I Left A Woman Waiting"

I left a woman waiting 
I met her sometime later 
She said, I see your eyes are dead 
What happened to you, lover? 
What happened to you, my lover? 
What happened to you, lover? 
What happened to you? 
And since she spoke the truth to me 
I tried to answer truthfully 
Whatever happened to my eyes 
Happened to your beauty 
Happened to your beauty 
What happened to your beauty 
Happened to me 

We took ourselves to someone's bed 
And there we fell together 
Quick as dogs and truly dead were we 
And free as running water 
Free as running water 
Free as running water 
Free as you and me 
The way it's got to be 
The way it's got to be, lover

"Don't Go Home With Your Hard-On"

I was born in a beauty salon 
My father was a dresser of hair 
My mother was a girl you could call on 
When you called she was always there 
When you called she was always there 
When you called she was always there 
When you called she was always there 
When you called she was always there 

Ah but don't go home with your hard-on 
It will only drive you insane 
You can't shake it (or break it) with your Motown 
You can't melt it down in the rain 

You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 

I've looked behind all of the faces 
That smile you down to you knees 
And the lips that say, Come on, taste us 
And when you try to they make you say Please 

When you try to they make you say Please 
When you try to they make you say Please 
When you try to they make you say Please 
When you try to they make you say Please 

Ah but don't go home with your hard-on ... 

Here come's your bride with her veil on 
Approach her, you wretch, if you dare 
Approach her, you ape with your tail on 
Once you have her she'll always be there 

Once you have her she'll always be there 
Once you have her she'll always be there 
Once you have her she'll always be there 
Once you have her she'll always be there 

Ah but don't go home with your hard-on ... 

So I work in that same beauty salon 
I'm chained to the old masquerade 
The lipstick, the shadow, the silicone 
I follow my father's trade 

I follow my father's trade 
Yes I follow my father's trade 
Yes I follow my father's trade 
Yes I follow my father's trade 

Ah but don't go home with your hard-on 
It will only drive you insane 
You can't shake it (or break it) with your Motown 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain

"Fingerprints"

I touched you once too often 
Now I don't know who I am 
My fingerprints were missing 
When I wiped away the jam 
Yes I called my fingerprints all night 
But they don't seem to care 
The last time that I saw them 
They were leafing through your hair 

Fingerprints, fingerprints 
Where are you now my fingerprints? 

Yeah I thought I'd leave this morning 
So I emptied out your drawer 
A hundred thousand fingerprints 
They floated to the floor 

You know you hardly stopped to pick them up 
You don't care what you lose 
Ah you don't even seem to know 
Whose fingerprints are whose 

Fingerprints, fingerprints 
Where are you now my fingerprints? 

And now you want to marry me 
You want to take me down the aisle 
You want to throw confetti fingerprints 
You know that's not my style 

O sure I'd like to marry you 
But I can't face the dawn 
With any girl who knew me 
When my fingerprints were on 

Fingerprints, fingerprints 
Where are you now my fingerprints? 

Fingerprints, oh fingerprints 
Where are you now my fingerprints?

"Death Of A Ladies' Man"

Ah the man she wanted all her life was hanging by a thread 
"I never even knew how much I wanted you," she said. 
His muscles they were numbered and his style was obsolete. 
"O baby, I have come too late." She knelt beside his feet. 
"I'll never see a face like yours in years of men to come 
I'll never see such arms again in wrestling or in love." 
And all his virtues burning in the smoky Holocaust 
She took unto herself most everything her lover lost 
Now the master of this landscape he was standing at the view 
with a sparrow of St. Francis that he was preaching to 
She beckoned to the sentry of his high religious mood 
She said, "I'll make a place between my legs, 
I'll show you solitude." 

He offered her an orgy in a many mirrored room 
He promised her protection for the issue of her womb 
She moved her body hard against a sharpened metal spoon 
She stopped the bloody rituals of passage to the moon 

She took his much admired oriental frame of mind 
and the heart-of-darkness alibi his money hides behind 
She took his blonde madonna and his monastery wine -- 
"This mental space is occupied and everything is mine." 

He tried to make a final stand beside the railway track 
She said, "The art of longing's over and it's never coming back." 
She took his tavern parliament, his cap, his cocky dance, 
she mocked his female fashions and his working-class moustache. 

The last time that I saw him he was trying hard to get 
a woman's education but he's not a woman yet 
And the last time that I saw her she was living with some boy 
who gives her soul an empty room and gives her body joy. 

So the great affair is over but whoever would have guessed 
it would leave us all so vacant and so deeply unimpressed 
It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star 
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far. 

It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star 
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far. 

It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star 
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far.

"The Guests"

One by one, the guests arrive 
The guests are coming through 
The open-hearted many 
The broken-hearted few 
And no one knows where the night is going 
And no one knows why the wine is flowing 
Oh love I need you 
I need you 
I need you 
I need you 
Oh . . . I need you now 

And those who dance, begin to dance 
Those who weep begin 
And "Welcome, welcome" cries a voice 
"Let all my guests come in." 

And no one knows where the night is going ... 

And all go stumbling through that house 
in lonely secrecy 
Saying "Do reveal yourself" 
or "Why has thou forsaken me?" 

And no one knows where the night is going ... 

All at once the torches flare 
The inner door flies open 
One by one they enter there 
In every style of passion 

And no one knows where the night is going ... 

And here they take their sweet repast 
While house and grounds dissolve 
And one by one the guests are cast 
Beyond the garden wall 

And no one knows where the night is going ... 

Those who dance, begin to dance 
Those who weep begin 
Those who earnestly are lost 
Are lost and lost again 

And no one knows where the night is going ... 

One by the guests arrive 
The guests are coming through 
The broken-hearted many 
The open-hearted few 

And no one knows where the night is going ...

"Humbled In Love"

Do you remember all of those pledges 
That we pledged in the passionate night 
Ah they're soiled now, they're torn at the edges 
Like moths on a still yellow light 
No penance serves to renew them 
No massive transfusions of trust 
Why not even revenge can undo them 
So twisted these vows and so crushed 
And you say you've been humbled in love 
Cut down in your love 
Forced to kneel in the mud next to me 
Ah but why so bitterly turn from the one 
Who kneels there as deeply as thee 

Children have takes these pledges 
They have ferried them out of the past 
Oh beyond all the graves and the hedges 
Where love must go hiding at last 
And here where there is no description 
Oh here in the moment at hand 
No sinner need rise up forgiven 
No victim need limp to the stand 

And you say you've been humbled in love... 

And look dear heart, look at the virgin 
Look how she welcomes him into her gown 
Yes, and mark how the stranger's cold armour 
Dissolves like a star falling down 
Why trade this vision for desire 
When you may have them both 
You will never see a man this naked 
I will never hold a woman this close 

And you say you've been humbled in love...

"The Window"

Why do you stand by the window 
Abandoned to beauty and pride 
The thorn of the night in your bosom 
The spear of the age in your side 
Lost in the rages of fragrance 
Lost in the rags of remorse 
Lost in the waves of a sickness 
That loosens the high silver nerves 
Oh chosen love, Oh frozen love 
Oh tangle of matter and ghost 
Oh darling of angels, demons and saints 
And the whole broken-hearted host 
Gentle this soul 

And come forth from the cloud of unknowing 
And kiss the cheek of the moon 
The New Jerusalem glowing 
Why tarry all night in the ruin 
And leave no word of discomfort 
And leave no observer to mourn 
But climb on your tears and be silent 
Like a rose on its ladder of thorns 

Oh chosen love, Oh frozen love... 

Then lay your rose on the fire 
The fire give up to the sun 
The sun give over to splendour 
In the arms of the high holy one 
For the holy one dreams of a letter 
Dreams of a letter's death 
Oh bless thee continuous stutter 
Of the word being made into flesh 

Oh chosen love, Oh frozen love... 

Gentle this soul

"Came So Far For Beauty"

I came so far for beauty
I left so much behind
My patience and my family
My masterpiece unsigned

I thought I'd be rewarded
For such a lonely choice
And surely she would answer
To such a very hopeless voice

I practiced on my sainthood
I gave to one and all
But the rumours of my virtue
They moved her not at all

I changed my style to silver
I changed my clothes to black
And where I would surrender
Ah now I would attack

I stormed the old casino
For the money and the flesh
And I myself decided
What was rotten and what was fresh

And men to do my bidding
And broken bones to teach
The value of my pardon
The shadow of my reach

But no, I could not touch her
With such a heavy hand
Her star beyond my order
Her nakedness unmanned

I came so far for beauty
I left so much behind
My patience and my family
My masterpiece unsigned

"Un Canadien Errant (The Lost Canadian)"

Un Canadien Errant (A wandering Canadian,)
Banni de ses foyers, (banned from his hearths,)
Parcourait en pleurant (travelled while crying)
Des pays etrangers. (in foreign lands.)
Parcourait en pleurant (travelled while crying)
Des pays etrangers. (in foreign lands.)
Un jour, triste et pensif, (One day, sad and pensive,)
Assis au bord des flots, (sitting by the flowing waters,)
Au courant fugitif (to the fleeing current)
Il adressa ces mots: (he addressed these words:)
Au courant fugitif (to the fleeing current)

"Si tu vois mon pays, (If you see my country,)
Mon pays malheureux, (my unhappy country,)
Va dire a mes amis (go tell my friends)
Que je me souviens d'eux. (that I remember them.)
Va dire a mes amis (go tell my friends)
Que je me souviens d'eux. (that I remember them.)

O jours si pleins d'appas, (O days so full of charms,)
Vous etes disparus... (you have vanished...)

Je ne la verrai plus. (I will see it no more.)
Et ma patrie, helas! (And my native land, alas!)
Je ne la verrai plus. (I will see it no more.)

"The Traitor"

Now the Swan it floated on the English river 
Ah the Rose of High Romance it opened wide 
A sun tanned woman yearned me through the summer 
and the judges watched us from the other side 
I told my mother "Mother I must leave you 
preserve my room but do not shed a tear 
Should rumour of a shabby ending reach you 
it was half my fault and half the atmosphere" 

But the Rose I sickened with a scarlet fever 
and the Swan I tempted with a sense of shame 
She said at last I was her finest lover 
and if she withered I would be to blame 

The judges said you missed it by a fraction 
rise up and brace your troops for the attack 
Ah the dreamers ride against the men of action 
Oh see the men of action falling back 

But I lingered on her thighs a fatal moment 
I kissed her lips as though I thirsted still 
My falsity had stung me like a hornet 
The poison sank and it paralysed my will 

I could not move to warn all the younger soldiers 
that they had been deserted from above 
So on battlefields from here to Barcelona 
I'm listed with the enemies of love 

And long ago she said "I must be leaving, 
Ah but keep my body here to lie upon 
You can move it up and down and when I'm sleeping 
Run some wire through that Rose and wind the Swan" 

So daily I renew my idle duty 
I touch her here and there -- I know my place 
I kiss her open mouth and I praise her beauty 
and people call me traitor to my face

"Our Lady Of Solitude"

All summer long she touched me 
She gathered in my soul 
From many a thorn, from many thickets 
Her fingers, like a weaver's 
Quick and cool 
And the light came from her body 
And the night went through her grace 
All summer long she touched me 
And I knew her, I knew her 
Face to face 

And her dress was blue and silver 
And her words were few and small 
She is the vessel of the whole wide world 
Mistress, oh mistress, of us all 

Dearly dead; Queen of Solitude 
I thank you with my heart 
for keeping me so close to thee 
while so many, oh so many, stood apart 

And the light came from her body 
And the night went through her grace 
All summer long she touched me 
I knew her, I knew her 
Face to face

"The Gypsy's Wife"

And where, where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight
I've heard all the wild reports, they can't be right
But whose head is this she's dancing with on the threshing floor
Whose darkness deepens in her arms a little more
And where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?
Where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?

Ah the silver knives are flashing in the tired old cafe
A ghost climbs on the table in a bridal negligee
She says, "My body is the light, my body is the way"
I raise my arm against it all and I catch the bride's bouquet

And where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?
Where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?

Too early for the rainbow, too early for the dove
These are the final days, this is the darkness, this is the flood
And there is no man or woman can be touched
But you who come between them will be judged

And where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?
Where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?

"The Smokey Life"

I've never seen your eyes so wide 
I've never seen your appetite quite this occupied 
Elsewhere is your feast of love 
I know ... where long ago we agreed to keep it light 
So lets be married one more night 
It's light, light enough 
To let it go 
It's light enough to let it go 

Remember when the scenery started fading 
I held you til you learned to walk on air 
So don't look down the ground is gone, 
there's no one waiting anyway 
The Smoky Life is practiced 
Everywhere 

So set your restless heart at ease 
Take a lesson from these Autumn leaves 
They waste no time waiting for the snow 
Don't argue now you'll be late 
There is nothing to investigate 

It's light enough, light enough 
To let it go 
Light enough to let it go 

Remember when the scenery started fading 
I held you til you learned to walk on air 
So don't look down the ground is gone, 
there's no one waiting anyway 
The Smoky Life is practiced everywhere 

Come on back if the moment lends 
You can look up all my very closest friends 

Light, light enough 
To let it go 
It's light enough to let it go

"Ballad Of The Absent Mare"

Say a prayer for the cowboy 
His mare's run away 
And he'll walk til he finds her 
His darling, his stray 
but the river's in flood 
and the roads are awash 
and the bridges break up 
in the panic of loss. 
And there's nothing to follow 
There's nowhere to go 
She's gone like the summer 
gone like the snow 
And the crickets are breaking 
his heart with their song 
as the day caves in 
and the night is all wrong 

Did he dream, was it she 
who went galloping past 
and bent down the fern 
broke open the grass 
and printed the mud with 
the iron and the gold 
that he nailed to her feet 
when he was the lord 

And although she goes grazing 
a minute away 
he tracks her all night 
he tracks her all day 
Oh blind to her presence 
except to compare 
his injury here 
with her punishment there 

Then at home on a branch 
in the highest tree 
a songbird sings out 
so suddenly 
Ah the sun is warm 
and the soft winds ride 
on the willow trees 
by the river side 

Oh the world is sweet 
the world is wide 
and she's there where 
the light and the darkness divide 
and the steam's coming off her 
she's huge and she's shy 
and she steps on the moon 
when she paws at the sky 

And she comes to his hand 
but she's not really tame 
She longs to be lost 
he longs for the same 
and she'll bolt and she'll plunge 
through the first open pass 
to roll and to feed 
in the sweet mountain grass 

Or she'll make a break 
for the high plateau 
where there's nothing above 
and there's nothing below 
and it's time for the burden 
it's time for the whip 
Will she walk through the flame 
Can he shoot from the hip 

So he binds himself 
to the galloping mare 
and she binds herself 
to the rider there 
and there is no space 
but there's left and right 
and there is no time 
but there's day and night 

And he leans on her neck 
and he whispers low 
"Whither thou goest 
I will go" 
And they turn as one 
and they head for the plain 
No need for the whip 
Ah, no need for the rein 

Now the clasp of this union 
who fastens it tight? 
Who snaps it asunder 
the very next night 
Some say the rider 
Some say the mare 
Or that love's like the smoke 
beyond all repair 

But my darling says 
"Leonard, just let it go by 
That old silhouette 
on the great western sky" 
So I pick out a tune 
and they move right along 
and they're gone like the smoke 
and they're gone like this song

"Dance Me To The End Of Love"

Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin 
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in 
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove 
Dance me to the end of love 
Dance me to the end of love 
Oh let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone 
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon 
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of 
Dance me to the end of love 
Dance me to the end of love 

Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on 
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long 
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above 
Dance me to the end of love 
Dance me to the end of love 

Dance me to the children who are asking to be born 
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn 
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn 
Dance me to the end of love 

Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin 
Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in 
Touch me with your naked hand, touch me with your glove
Dance me to the end of love 
Dance me to the end of love 
Dance me to the end of love

"Coming Back To You"

Maybe I'm still hurting 
I can't turn the other cheek 
But you know that I still love you 
It's just that I can't speak 
I looked for you in everyone 
And they called me on that too 
I lived alone but I was only 
Coming back to you 
Ah they're shutting down the factory now 
Just when all the bills are due 
And the fields they're under lock and key 
Tho' the rain and the sun come through 
And springtime starts but then it stops 
In the name of something new 
And all the senses rise against this 
Coming back to you 

And they're handing down my sentence now 
And I know what I must do 
Another mile of silence while I'm 
Coming back to you 

There are many in your life 
And many still to be 
Since you are a shining light 
There's many that you'll see 
But I have to deal with envy 
When you choose the precious few 
Who've left their pride on the other side of 
Coming back to you 

Even in your arms I know 
I'll never get it right 
Even when you bend to give me 
Comfort in the night 
I've got to have your word on this 
Or none of it is true 
And all I've said was just instead of 
Coming back to you

"The Law"

How many times did you call me 
And I knew it was late 
I left everybody 
But I never went straight 
I don't claim to be guilty 
But I do understand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 
Now my heart's like a blister 
From doing what I do 
If the moon has a sister 
It's got to be you 
I'm going to miss you forever 
Tho' it's not what I planned 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 

Now the deal has been dirty 
Since dirty began 
I'm not asking for mercy 
Not from the man 
You just don't ask for mercy 
While you're still on the stand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 

I don't claim to be guilty 
Guilty's too grand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 

That's all I can say, baby 
That's all I can say 
It wasn't for nothing 
That they put me away 
I fell with my angel 
Down the chain of command 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand

"The Night Comes On"

I went down to the place 
Where I knew she lay waiting 
Under the marble and the snow 
I said, Mother I'm frightened 
The thunder and the lightning 
I'll never come through this alone 
She said, I'll be with you 
My shawl wrapped around you 
My hand on your head when you go 
And the night came on 
It was very calm 
I wanted the night to go on and on 
But she said, Go back, Go back to the World 

We were fighting in Egypt 
When they signed this agreement 
That nobody else had to die 
There was this terrible sound 
My father went down 
With a terrible wound in his side 
He said, Try to go on 
Take my books, take my gun 
Remember, my son, how they lied 
And the night comes on 
It's very calm 
I'd like to pretend that my father was wrong 
But you don't want to lie, not to the young 

We were locked in this kitchen 
I took to religion 
And I wondered how long she would stay 
I needed so much 
To have nothing to touch 
I've always been greedy that way 
But my son and my daughter 
Climbed out of the water 
Crying, Papa, you promised to play 
And they lead me away 
To the great surprise 
It's Papa, don't peek, Papa, cover your eyes 
And they hide, they hide in the World 

Now I look for her always 
I'm lost in this calling 
I'm tied to the threads of some prayer 
Saying, When will she summon me 
When will she come to me 
What must I do to prepare 
When she bends to my longing 
Like a willow, like a fountain 
She stands in the luminous air 
And the night comes on 
And it's very calm 
I lie in her arms she says, When I'm gone
I'll be yours, yours for a song 

Now the crickets are singing 
The vesper bells ringing 
The cat's curled asleep in his chair 
I'll go down to Bill's Bar 
I can make it that far 
And I'll see if my friends are still there 
Yes, and here's to the few 
Who forgive what you do 
And the fewer who don't even care 
And the night comes on 
It's very calm 
I want to cross over, I want to go home 
But she says, Go back, go back to the World

"Hallelujah"

Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I didâwell, reallyâwhat's it to you?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah

"The Captain"

Now the Captain called me to his bed 
He fumbled for my hand 
"Take these silver bars," he said 
"I'm giving you command." 
"Command of what, there's no one here 
There's only you and me -- 
All the rest are dead or in retreat 
Or with the enemy." 
"Complain, complain, that's all you've done 
Ever since we lost 
If it's not the Crucifixion 
Then it's the Holocaust." 
"May Christ have mercy on your soul 
For making such a joke 
Amid these hearts that burn like coal 
And the flesh that rose like smoke." 

"I know that you have suffered, lad, 
But suffer this awhile: 
Whatever makes a soldier sad 
Will make a killer smile." 
"I'm leaving, Captain, I've got to go 
There's blood upon your hand 
But tell me, Captain, if you know 
Of a decent place to stand." 

"There is no decent place to stand 
In a massacre; 
But if a woman take your hand 
Then go and stand with her." 
"I left a wife in Tennessee 
And a baby in Saigon -- 
I risked my life, but not to hear 
Some country-western song." 

"Ah but if you cannot raise your love 
To a very high degree, 
Then you're just the man I've been thinking of -- 
So come and stand with me." 
"Your standing days are done," I cried, 
"You'll rally me no more. 
I don't even know what side 
We fought on, or what for." 

"I'm on the side that's always lost 
Against the side of Heaven 
I'm on the side of Snake-eyes tossed 
Against the side of Seven. 
And I've read the Bill of Human Rights 
And some of it was true 
But there wasn't any burden left 
So I'm laying it on you." 

Now the Captain he was dying 
But the Captain wasn't hurt 
The silver bars were in my hand 
I pinned them to my shirt.

"Hunter's Lullaby"

Your father's gone a-hunting 
He's deep in the forest so wild 
And he cannot take his wife with him 
He cannot take his child 
Your father's gone a-hunting 
In the quicksand and the clay 
And a woman cannot follow him 
Although she knows the way 

Your father's gone a-hunting 
Through the silver and the glass 
Where only greed can enter 
But spirit, spirit cannot pass 

Your father's gone a-hunting 
For the beast we'll never bind
And he leaves a baby sleeping 
And his blessings all behind 

Your father's gone a-hunting 
And he's lost his lucky charm 
And he's lost the guardian heart 
That keeps the hunter from the harm 

Your father's gone a-hunting 
He asked me to say goodbye 
And he warned me not to stop him 
I wouldn't, I wouldn't even try

"Heart With No Companion"

I greet you from the other side 
Of sorrow and despair 
With a love so vast and shattered 
It will reach you everywhere 
And I sing this for the captain 
Whose ship has not been built 
For the mother in confusion 
Her cradle still unfilled 

For the heart with no companion 
For the soul without a king 
For the prima ballerina 
Who cannot dance to anything 

Through the days of shame that are coming 
Through the nights of wild distress 
Tho' your promise count for nothing 
You must keep it nonetheless 

You must keep it for the captain 
Whose ship has not been built 
For the mother in confusion 
Her cradle still unfilled 

For the heart with no companion ... 

I greet you from the other side ...

"If It Be Your Will"

If it be your will
That I speak no more
And my voice be still
As it was before
I will speak no more
I shall abide until
I am spoken for
If it be your will

If it be your will
That a voice be true
From this broken hill
I will sing to you
From this broken hill
All your praises they shall ring
If it be your will
To let me sing

From this broken hill 
All your praises they shall ring 
If it be your will 
To let me sing 

If it be your will 
If there is a choice 
Let the rivers fill 
Let the hills rejoice 
Let your mercy spill
On all these burning hearts in hell
If it be your will
To make us well

And draw us near
And bind us tight
All your children here
In their rags of light
In our rags of light
All dressed to kill
And end this night
If it be your will
If it be your will

"First We Take Manhattan"

They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom 
For trying to change the system from within 
I'm coming now, I'm coming to reward them 
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin 
I'm guided by a signal in the heavens 
I'm guided by this birthmark on my skin 
I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons 
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin 

I'd really like to live beside you, baby 
I love your body and your spirit and your clothes 
But you see that line there moving through the station? 
I told you, I told you, told you, I was one of those 

Ah you loved me as a loser, but now you're worried that I just might win 
You know the way to stop me, but you don't have the discipline 
How many nights I prayed for this, to let my work begin 
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin 

I don't like your fashion business mister 
And I don't like these drugs that keep you thin 
I don't like what happened to my sister 
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin 

I'd really like to live beside you, baby ... 

And I thank you for those items that you sent me 
The monkey and the plywood violin 
I practiced every night, now I'm ready 
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin 

I am guided 

Ah remember me, I used to live for music 
Remember me, I brought your groceries in 
Well it's Father's Day and everybody's wounded 
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

"Ain't No Cure For Love"

I loved you for a long, long time 
I know this love is real 
It don't matter how it all went wrong 
That don't change the way I feel 
And I can't believe that time's 
Gonna heal this wound I'm speaking of 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure for love 
I'm aching for you baby 
I can't pretend I'm not 
I need to see you naked 
In your body and your thought 
I've got you like a habit 
And I'll never get enough 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure for love 

There ain't no cure for love 
There ain't no cure for love 
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky 
The holy books are open wide 
The doctors working day and night 
But they'll never ever find that cure for love 
There ain't no drink no drug 
(Ah tell them, angels) 
There's nothing pure enough to be a cure for love 

I see you in the subway and I see you on the bus 
I see you lying down with me, I see you waking up 
I see your hand, I see your hair 
Your bracelets and your brush 
And I call to you, I call to you 
But I don't call soft enough 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure for love 

I walked into this empty church I had no place else to go 
When the sweetest voice I ever heard, whispered to my soul 
I don't need to be forgiven for loving you so much 
It's written in the scriptures 
It's written there in blood 
I even heard the angels declare it from above 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure for love 

There ain't no cure for love 
There ain't no cure for love 
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky 
The holy books are open wide 
The doctors working day and night 
But they'll never ever find that cure, 
That cure for love

"Everybody Knows"

Everybody knows that the dice are loaded 
Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed 
Everybody knows that the war is over 
Everybody knows the good guys lost 
Everybody knows the fight was fixed 
The poor stay poor, the rich get rich 
That's how it goes 
Everybody knows 
Everybody knows that the boat is leaking 
Everybody knows that the captain lied 
Everybody got this broken feeling 
Like their father or their dog just died 

Everybody talking to their pockets 
Everybody wants a box of chocolates 
And a long stem rose 
Everybody knows 

Everybody knows that you love me baby 
Everybody knows that you really do 
Everybody knows that you've been faithful 
Ah give or take a night or two 
Everybody knows you've been discreet 
But there were so many people you just had to meet 
Without your clothes 
And everybody knows 

Everybody knows, everybody knows 
That's how it goes 
Everybody knows 

Everybody knows, everybody knows 
That's how it goes 
Everybody knows 

And everybody knows that it's now or never 
Everybody knows that it's me or you 
And everybody knows that you live forever 
Ah when you've done a line or two 
Everybody knows the deal is rotten 
Old Black Joe's still pickin' cotton 
For your ribbons and bows 
And everybody knows 

And everybody knows that the Plague is coming 
Everybody knows that it's moving fast 
Everybody knows that the naked man and woman 
Are just a shining artifact of the past 
Everybody knows the scene is dead 
But there's gonna be a meter on your bed 
That will disclose 
What everybody knows 

And everybody knows that you're in trouble 
Everybody knows what you've been through 
From the bloody cross on top of Calvary 
To the beach of Malibu 
Everybody knows it's coming apart 
Take one last look at this Sacred Heart 
Before it blows 
And everybody knows 

Everybody knows, everybody knows 
That's how it goes 
Everybody knows 

Oh everybody knows, everybody knows 
That's how it goes 
Everybody knows 

Everybody knows

"I'm Your Man"

If you want a lover 
I'll do anything you ask me to 
And if you want another kind of love 
I'll wear a mask for you 
If you want a partner 
Take my hand 
Or if you want to strike me down in anger 
Here I stand 
I'm your man 
If you want a boxer 
I will step into the ring for you 
And if you want a doctor 
I'll examine every inch of you 
If you want a driver 
Climb inside 
Or if you want to take me for a ride 
You know you can 
I'm your man 

Ah, the moon's too bright 
The chain's too tight 
The beast won't go to sleep 
I've been running through these promises to you 
That I made and I could not keep 
Ah but a man never got a woman back 
Not by begging on his knees 
Or I'd crawl to you baby 
And I'd fall at your feet 
And I'd howl at your beauty 
Like a dog in heat 
And I'd claw at your heart 
And I'd tear at your sheet 
I'd say please, please 
I'm your man 

And if you've got to sleep 
A moment on the road 
I will steer for you 
And if you want to work the street alone 
I'll disappear for you 
If you want a father for your child 
Or only want to walk with me a while 
Across the sand 
I'm your man 

If you want a lover 
I'll do anything you ask me to 
And if you want another kind of love 
I'll wear a mask for you

"Take This Waltz"

Now in Vienna there's ten pretty women 
There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry 
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows 
There's a tree where the doves go to die 
There's a piece that was torn from the morning 
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws 
Oh I want you, I want you, I want you 
On a chair with a dead magazine 
In the cave at the tip of the lily 
In some hallways where love's never been 
On a bed where the moon has been sweating 
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
Take its broken waist in your hand 

This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz 
With its very own breath of brandy and Death 
Dragging its tail in the sea 

There's a concert hall in Vienna 
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews 
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking 
They've been sentenced to death by the blues 
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture 
With a garland of freshly cut tears? 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
Take this waltz it's been dying for years 

There's an attic where children are playing 
Where I've got to lie down with you soon 
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns 
In the mist of some sweet afternoon 
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow 
All your sheep and your lilies of snow 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
With its "I'll never forget you, you know!" 

This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz ... 

And I'll dance with you in Vienna 
I'll be wearing a river's disguise 
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder, 
My mouth on the dew of your thighs 
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook, 
With the photographs there, and the moss 
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty 
My cheap violin and my cross 
And you'll carry me down on your dancing 
To the pools that you lift on your wrist 
Oh my love, Oh my love 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
It's yours now. It's all that there is

"Jazz Police"

Can you tell me why the bells are ringing? 
Nothing's happened in a million years 
I've been sitting here since Wednesday morning 
Wednesday morning can't believe my ears 
Jazz police are looking through my folders 
Jazz police are talking to my niece 
Jazz police have got their final orders 
Jazzer, drop your axe, it's Jazz police! 

Jesus taken serious by the many 
Jesus taken joyous by a few 
Jazz police are paid by J. Paul Getty 
Jazzers paid by J. Paul Getty II 

Jazz police I hear you calling 
Jazz police I feel so blue 
Jazz police I think I'm falling, 
I'm falling for you 

Wild as any freedom loving racist 
I applaud the actions of the chief 
Tell me now oh beautiful and spacious 
Am I in trouble with the Jazz police? 

Jazz police are looking through my folders ... 

They will never understand our culture 
They'll never understand the Jazz police 
Jazz police are working for my mother 
Blood is thicker margarine than grease 

Let me be somebody I admire 
Let me be that muscle down the street 
Stick another turtle on the fire 
Guys like me are mad for turtle meat 

Jazz police I hear you calling 
Jazz police I feel so blue 
Jazz police I think I'm falling, 
I'm falling for you

"I Can't Forget"

I stumbled out of bed 
I got ready for the struggle 
I smoked a cigarette 
And I tightened up my gut 
I said this can't be me 
Must be my double 
And I can't forget, I can't forget 
I can't forget but I don't remember what 
I'm burning up the road 
I'm heading down to Phoenix 
I got this old address 
Of someone that I knew 
It was high and fine and free 
Ah, you should have seen us 
And I can't forget, I can't forget 
I can't forget but I don't remember who 

I'll be there today 
With a big bouquet of cactus 
I got this rig that runs on memories 
And I promise, cross my heart, 
They'll never catch us 
But if they do, just tell them it was me 

Yeah I loved you all my life 
And that's how I want to end it 
The summer's almost gone 
The winter's tuning up 
Yeah, the summer's gone 
But a lot goes on forever 
And I can't forget, I can't forget 
I can't forget but I don't remember what

"Tower Of Song"

Well my friends are gone and my hair is grey
I ache in the places where I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
I'm just paying my rent every day
Oh in the Tower of Song

I said to Hank Williams: how lonely does it get?
Hank Williams hasn't answered yet
But I hear him coughing all night long
A hundred floors above me
In the Tower of Song

I was born like this, I had no choice
I was born with the gift of a golden voice
And twenty-seven angels from the Great Beyond
They tied me to this table right here
In the Tower of Song

So you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll
I'm very sorry, baby, doesn't look like me at all
I'm standing by the window where the light is strong
Ah they don't let a woman kill you
Not in the Tower of Song

Now you can say that I've grown bitter but of this you may be sure
The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor
And there's a mighty judgment coming, but I may be wrong
You see, you hear these funny voices
In the Tower of Song

I see you standing on the other side
I don't know how the river got so wide
I loved you baby, way back when
And all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed
But I feel so close to everything that we lost
We'll never, we'll never have to lose it again

Now I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'll be back
They're moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track
But you'll be hearing from me baby, long after I'm gone
I'll be speaking to you sweetly
From a window in the Tower of Song

Yeah my friends are gone and my hair is grey
I ache in the places where I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
I'm just paying my rent every day
Oh in the Tower of Song

"The Future"

Give me back my broken night
My mirrored room, my secret life
It's lonely here
There's no one left to torture
Give me absolute control
Over every living soul
And lie beside me, baby
That's an order!
Give me crack and anal sex
Take the only tree that's left
And stuff it up the hole
In your culture
Give me back the Berlin wall
Give me Stalin and St Paul
I've seen the future, brother:
It is murder

Things are going to slide, slide in all directions
Won't be nothing
Nothing you can measure anymore
The blizzard, the blizzard of the world
Has crossed the threshold
And it has overturned
The order of the soul
When they said REPENT REPENT
I wonder what they meant
When they said REPENT REPENT
I wonder what they meant
When they said REPENT REPENT
I wonder what they meant

You don't know me from the wind
You never will, you never did
I'm the little Jew
Who wrote the Bible
I've seen the nations rise and fall
I've heard their stories, heard them all
But love's the only engine of survival
Your servant here, he has been told
To say it clear, to say it cold:
It's over, it ain't going
Any further
And now the wheels of heaven stop
You feel the devil's riding crop
Get ready for the future:
It is murder

Things are going to slide

There'll be the breaking of the ancient
Western code
Your private life will suddenly explode
There'll be phantoms
There'll be fires on the road
And the white man dancing
You'll see your woman
Hanging upside down
Her features covered by her fallen gown
And all the lousy little poets
Coming round
Tryin' to sound like Charlie Manson
And the white man dancin'

Give me back the Berlin wall
Give me Stalin and St Paul
Give me Christ
Or give me Hiroshima
Destroy another fetus now
We don't like children anyhow
I've seen the future, baby:
It is murder

Things are going to slide

When they said repent repent

"Waiting For The Miracle"

Baby, I've been waiting, 
I've been waiting night and day. 
I didn't see the time, 
I waited half my life away. 
There were lots of invitations 
and I know you sent me some, 
but I was waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 
I know you really loved me. 
but, you see, my hands were tied. 
I know it must have hurt you, 
it must have hurt your pride 
to have to stand beneath my window 
with your bugle and your drum, 
and me I'm up there waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 

Ah I don't believe you'd like it, 
You wouldn't like it here. 
There ain't no entertainment 
and the judgements are severe. 
The Maestro says it's Mozart 
but it sounds like bubble gum 
when you're waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 

Waiting for the miracle 
There's nothing left to do. 
I haven't been this happy 
since the end of World War II. 

Nothing left to do 
when you know that you've been taken. 
Nothing left to do 
when you're begging for a crumb 
Nothing left to do 
when you've got to go on waiting 
waiting for the miracle to come. 

I dreamed about you, baby. 
It was just the other night. 
Most of you was naked 
Ah but some of you was light. 
The sands of time were falling 
from your fingers and your thumb, 
and you were waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come 

Ah baby, let's get married, 
we've been alone too long. 
Let's be alone together. 
Let's see if we're that strong. 
Yeah let's do something crazy, 
something absolutely wrong 
while we're waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 

Nothing left to do ... 

When you've fallen on the highway 
and you're lying in the rain, 
and they ask you how you're doing 
of course you'll say you can't complain -- 
If you're squeezed for information, 
that's when you've got to play it dumb: 
You just say you're out there waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come.

"Be For Real"

Are you back in my life to stay 
Or is it just for today 
Oh that you're gonna need me? 
If it's a thrill you're looking for 
Honey, I'm flexible. Oh, yeah. 
Just be for real won't you, Baby 
Be for real oh, Baby 
You see I, I don't want to be hurt by love again 

So you see I'm not naive. 
I just would like to believe 
Ah what you tell me. 
So don't give me the world today 
And tomorrow take it away. 
Don't do that to me, darling. 

Just be for real won't you, Baby 
Be for real won't you, Baby 

Been hurt so many times 
You see I, I don't want to be hurt by love again. 

(I don't give a damn about the truth, Baby 
Except for the naked truth. Oh yeah) 

Just be for real won't you, Baby 
Be for real won't you, Baby 

No, no, no, no 
It's just that I, I don't want to be hurt by love again. 

Thanks for the song Mr. Knight.

"Closing Time"

Ah we're drinking and we're dancing 
and the band is really happening 
and the Johnny Walker wisdom running high 
And my very sweet companion 
she's the Angel of Compassion 
she's rubbing half the world against her thigh 
And every drinker every dancer 
lifts a happy face to thank her 
the fiddler fiddles something so sublime 
all the women tear their blouses off 
and the men they dance on the polka-dots 
and it's partner found, it's partner lost 
and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops: 
it's CLOSING TIME 
Yeah the women tear their blouses off 
and the men they dance on the polka-dots 
and it's partner found, it's partner lost 
and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops: 
it's CLOSING TIME 

Ah we're lonely, we're romantic 
and the cider's laced with acid 
and the Holy Spirit's crying, "Where's the beef?" 
And the moon is swimming naked 
and the summer night is fragrant 
with a mighty expectation of relief 
So we struggle and we stagger 
down the snakes and up the ladder 
to the tower where the blessed hours chime 
and I swear it happened just like this: 
a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss 
the Gates of Love they budged an inch 
I can't say much has happened since 
but CLOSING TIME 

I swear it happened just like this: 
a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss 
the Gates of Love they budged an inch 
I can't say much has happened since 
CLOSING TIME 

I loved you for your beauty 
but that doesn't make a fool of me: 
you were in it for your beauty too 
and I loved you for your body 
there's a voice that sounds like God to me 
declaring, declaring, declaring that your body's really you 
And I loved you when our love was blessed 
and I love you now there's nothing left 
but sorrow and a sense of overtime 
and I missed you since the place got wrecked 
And I just don't care what happens next 
looks like freedom but it feels like death 
it's something in between, I guess 
it's CLOSING TIME 

Yeah I missed you since the place got wrecked 
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex 
looks like freedom but it feels like death 
it's something in between, I guess 
it's CLOSING TIME 

Yeah we're drinking and we're dancing 
but there's nothing really happening 
and the place is dead as Heaven on a Saturday night 
And my very close companion 
gets me fumbling gets me laughing 
she's a hundred but she's wearing 
something tight 
and I lift my glass to the Awful Truth 
which you can't reveal to the Ears of Youth 
except to say it isn't worth a dime 
And the whole damn place goes crazy twice 
and it's once for the devil and once for Christ 
but the Boss don't like these dizzy heights 
we're busted in the blinding lights, 
busted in the blinding lights 
of CLOSING TIME 

The whole damn place goes crazy twice 
and it's once for the devil and once for Christ 
but the Boss don't like these dizzy heights 
we're busted in the blinding lights, 
busted in the blinding lights 
of CLOSING TIME 

Oh the women tear their blouses off 
and the men they dance on the polka-dots 
It's CLOSING TIME 
And it's partner found, it's partner lost 
and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops 
It's CLOSING TIME 
I swear it happened just like this: 
a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss 
It's CLOSING TIME 
The Gates of Love they budged an inch 
I can't say much has happened since 
But CLOSING TIME 
I loved you when our love was blessed 
I love you now there's nothing left 
But CLOSING TIME 
I miss you since the place got wrecked 
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex.

"Anthem"

The birds they sang 
At the break of day 
Start again 
I heard them say 
Don't dwell on what 
Has passed away 
Or what is yet to be. 
Ah the wars they will 
Be fought again 
The holy dove 
She will be caught again 
Bought and sold 
And bought again 
The dove is never free. 

Ring the bells that still can ring 
Forget your perfect offering 
There is a crack a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in. 

We asked for signs 
The signs were sent: 
The birth betrayed 
The marriage spent 
Yeah the widowhood 
Of every government
Signs for all to see. 

I can run no more 
With that lawless crowd 
While the killers in high places 
Say their prayers out loud. 
But they've summoned, they've summoned up 
A thundercloud 
They're gonna hear from me. 

Ring ring ring ring ring 

Ring the bells that still can ring 
Forget your perfect offering 
There is a crack a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in 

You can add up the parts 
But you won't have the sum 
You can strike up the march, 
There is no drum 
Every heart, every heart 
To love will come 
But like a refugee. 

Ring the bells that still can ring 
Forget your perfect offering 
There is a crack, a crack in everything 
That's how the light gets in. 

Ring the bells that still can ring 
Forget your perfect offering 
There is a crack, a crack in everything 
That's how the light gets in. 
That's how the light gets in. 
That's how the light gets in.

"Democracy"

It's coming through a hole in the air, 
from those nights in Tiananmen Square. 
It's coming from the feel 
that this ain't exactly real, 
or it's real, but it ain't exactly there. 
From the wars against disorder, 
from the sirens night and day, 
from the fires of the homeless, 
from the ashes of the gay: 
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 
It's coming through a crack in the wall; 
on a visionary flood of alcohol; 
from the staggering account 
of the Sermon on the Mount 
which I don't pretend to understand at all. 
It's coming from the silence 
on the dock of the bay, 
from the brave, the bold, the battered 
heart of Chevrolet: 
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 

It's coming from the sorrow in the street, 
the holy places where the races meet; 
from the homicidal bitchin' 
that goes down in every kitchen 
to determine who will serve and who will eat. 
From the wells of disappointment 
where the women kneel to pray 
for the grace of God in the desert here 
and the desert far away: 
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 

Sail on, sail on 
O mighty Ship of State! 
To the Shores of Need 
Past the Reefs of Greed 
Through the Squalls of Hate 
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on. 

It's coming to America first, 
the cradle of the best and of the worst. 
It's here they got the range 
and the machinery for change 
and it's here they got the spiritual thirst. 
It's here the family's broken 
and it's here the lonely say 
that the heart has got to open 
in a fundamental way: 
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 

It's coming from the women and the men. 
O baby, we'll be making love again. 
We'll be going down so deep 
the river's going to weep, 
and the mountain's going to shout Amen! 
It's coming like the tidal flood 
beneath the lunar sway, 
imperial, mysterious, 
in amorous array: 
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 

Sail on, sail on ... 

I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean 
I love the country but I can't stand the scene. 
And I'm neither left or right 
I'm just staying home tonight, 
getting lost in that hopeless little screen. 
But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags 
that Time cannot decay, 
I'm junk but I'm still holding up 
this little wild bouquet: 
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.

"Light As The Breeze"

She stands before you naked 
you can see it, you can taste it, 
and she comes to you light as the breeze. 
Now you can drink it or you can nurse it, 
it don't matter how you worship 
as long as you're 
down on your knees. 
So I knelt there at the delta, 
at the alpha and the omega, 
at the cradle of the river and the seas. 
And like a blessing come from heaven 
for something like a second 
I was healed and my heart 
was at ease. 

O baby I waited 
so long for your kiss 
for something to happen, 
oh something like this. 

And you're weak and you're harmless 
and you're sleeping in your harness 
and the wind going wild 
in the trees, 
and it ain't exactly prison 
but you'll never be forgiven 
for whatever you've done 
with the keys. 

O baby I waited ... 

It's dark now and it's snowing 
O my love I must be going, 
The river has started to freeze. 
And I'm sick of pretending 
I'm broken from bending 
I've lived too long on my knees. 

Then she dances so graceful 
and your heart's hard and hateful 
and she's naked 
but that's just a tease. 
And you turn in disgust 
from your hatred and from your love 
and comes to you 
light as the breeze. 

O baby I waited ... 

There's blood on every bracelet 
you can see it, you can taste it, 
and it's Please baby 
please baby please. 
And she says, Drink deeply, pilgrim 
but don't forget there's still a woman 
beneath this 
resplendent chemise. 

So I knelt there at the delta, 
at the alpha and the omega, 
I knelt there like one who believes. 
And the blessings come from heaven 
and for something like a second 
I'm cured and my heart 
is at ease

"Always"

(Oh friends, .. don't matter if you're a man or a woman. If you're in love 
with somebody, these are the words that you got to learn to say. Now 
listen carefully. Here it comes...) 
I'll be loving you always 
with a love that's true, always 
When the thing you've planned 
needs my helping hand, 
I will understand, always, always 

Days may not be fair, always 
Yeah but that's when I'll be there, always 
Not for just an hour, 
Not for just a day, 
Not for just a year, but always. 

I said that I'll be loving you, always 
with a love that's true, always. 
When the thing you've planned 
needs my helping hand, 
I will, I will understand, always, always 

(Oh that's pretty ... that's pretty too ... Oh darling) 

The days may not be fair, always 
Yeah but that's when I'll be there, always 
Not for just a second, or a minute, or an hour, 
Not for just a weekend and a shake down in the shower, 
Not for just the summer and the winter going sour, 
But always, always, always 

(Ok if you don't want to quit, let's try it one more time) 

I'll be loving you, always 
with a love that's true, always. 
When the thing you've planned 
needs my helping hand, 
I will understand, I will, I will understand, always, always 

The days may not be fair, always 
(Don't worry, baby) 
That's when I'll be there, always 
Not for just an hour, 
Not for just a day, 
Not for just a year, but always.

"In My Secret Life"

I saw you this morning
You were moving so fast
Can't seem to loosen my grip
On the past
And I miss you so much
There's no one in sight
And we're still making love
In My Secret Life

I smile when I'm angry
I cheat and I lie
I do what I have to do
To get by
But I know what is wrong
And I know what is right
And I'd die for the truth
In My Secret Life

Hold on, hold on, my brother
My sister, hold on tight
I finally got my orders
I'll be marching through the morning
Marching through the night
Moving cross the borders
Of My Secret Life

Looked through the paper
Makes you want to cry
Nobody cares if the people
Live or die
And the dealer wants you thinking
That it's either black or white
Thank God it's not that simple
In My Secret Life

I bite my lip
I buy what I'm told
From the latest hit
To the wisdom of old
But I'm always alone
And my heart is like ice
And it's crowded and cold
In My Secret Life

"A Thousand Kisses Deep"

The ponies run, the girls are young,
The odds are there to beat.
You win a while, and then itâs done â
Your little winning streak.
And summoned now to deal
With your invincible defeat,
You live your life as if itâs real,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

Iâm turning tricks, Iâm getting fixed,
Iâm back on Boogie Street.
You lose your grip, and then you slip
Into the Masterpiece.
And maybe I had miles to drive,
And promises to keep:
You ditch it all to stay alive,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

And sometimes when the night is slow,
The wretched and the meek,
We gather up our hearts and go,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

Confined to sex, we pressed against
The limits of the sea:
I saw there were no oceans left
For scavengers like me.
I made it to the forward deck.
I blessed our remnant fleet â
And then consented to be wrecked,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

Iâm turning tricks, Iâm getting fixed,
Iâm back on Boogie Street.
I guess they wonât exchange the gifts
That you were meant to keep.
And quiet is the thought of you,
The file on you complete,
Except what we forgot to do,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

And sometimes when the night is slow,
The wretched and the meek,
We gather up our hearts and go,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

The ponies run, the girls are young, 
The odds are there to beat . . .

"That Don't Make It Junk"

I fought against the bottle,
But I had to do it drunk â
Took my diamond to the pawnshop â
But that donât make it junk.

I know that Iâm forgiven,
But I donât know how I know
I donât trust my inner feelings â
Inner feelings come and go.

How come you called me here tonight?
How come you bother
With my heart at all?
You raise me up in grace,
Then you put me in a place,
Where I must fall.

Too late to fix another drink â
The lights are going out â
Iâll listen to the darkness sing â
I know what thatâs about.

I tried to love you my way,
But I couldnât make it hold.
So I closed the Book of Longing
And I do what I am told.

How come you called me here tonight?
How come you bother with my heart at all?
You raise me up in grace,
Then you put me in a place,
Where I must fall.

I fought against the bottle,
But I had to do it drunk â
Took my diamond to the pawnshop â
But that donât make it junk.

"Here It Is"

Here is your crown
And your seal and rings;
And here is your love
For all things.

Here is your cart,
And your cardboard and piss;
And here is your love
For all of this.

May everyone live,
And may everyone die.
Hello, my love,
And my love, Goodbye.

Here is your wine,
And your drunken fall;
And here is your love.
Your love for it all.

Here is your sickness.
Your bed and your pan;
And here is your love
For the woman, the man.

May everyone live,
And may everyone die.
Hello, my love,
And, my love, Goodbye.

And here is the night,
The night has begun;
And here is your death
In the heart of your son.

And here is the dawn,
(Until death do us part);
And here is your death,
In your daughterâs heart.

May everyone live,
And may everyone die.
Hello, my love,
And, my love, Goodbye.

And here you are hurried,
And here you are gone;
And here is the love,
That itâs all built upon.

Here is your cross,
Your nails and your hill;
And here is your love,
That lists where it will

May everyone live,
And may everyone die.
Hello, my love,
And my love, Goodbye.

"Love Itself"

The light came through the window,
Straight from the sun above,
And so inside my little room
There plunged the rays of Love.

In streams of light I clearly saw
The dust you seldom see,
Out of which the Nameless makes
A Name for one like me.

Iâll try to say a little more:
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door â
Then Love Itself
Love Itself was gone.

All busy in the sunlight
The flecks did float and dance,
And I was tumbled up with them
In formless circumstance.

Iâll try to say a little more:
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door â
Then Love Itself
Love Itself was gone.

Then I came back from where Iâd been.
My room, it looked the same â
But there was nothing left between
The Nameless and the Name.

All busy in the sunlight
The flecks did float and dance,
And I was tumbled up with them
In formless circumstance.

Iâll try to say a little more:
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door â
Then Love itself,
Love Itself was gone.
Love Itself was gone.

"By The Rivers Dark"

By the rivers dark
I wandered on.
I lived my life
in Babylon.

And I did forget
My holy song:
And I had no strength
In Babylon.

By the rivers dark
Where I could not see
Who was waiting there
Who was hunting me.

And he cut my lip
And he cut my heart.
So I could not drink
From the river dark.

And he covered me,
And I saw within,
My lawless heart
And my wedding ring,

I did not know
And I could not see
Who was waiting there,
Who was hunting me.

By the rivers dark
I panicked on.
I belonged at last
to Babylon.

Then he struck my heart
With a deadly force,
And he said, âThis heart:
It is not yours.â

And he gave the wind
My wedding ring;
And he circled us
With everything.

By the rivers dark,
In a wounded dawn,
I live my life
In Babylon.

Though I take my song
From a withered limb,
Both song and tree,
They sing for him.

Be the truth unsaid
And the blessing gone,
If I forget
My Babylon.

I did not know 
And I could not see
Who was waiting there,
Who was hunting me.

By the rivers dark, 
Where it all goes on;
By the rivers dark
In Babylon.

"Alexandra Leaving"

Suddenly the night has grown colder
The god of love preparing to depart
Alexandra hoisted on his shoulder
They slip between the sentries of the heart

Upheld by the simplicities of pleasure
They gain the light, they formlessly entwine
And radiant beyond your widest measure
They fall among the voices and the wine

Itâs not a trick, your senses all deceiving
A fitful dream, the morning will exhaust â
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for this to happen
Go firmly to the window. Drink it in
Exquisite music. Alexandra laughing
Your first commitments tangible again

And you who had the honor of her evening
And by that honor had your own restored â
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Alexandra leaving with her lord

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for the occasion
In full command of every plan you wrecked â
Do not choose a cowardâs explanation
that hides behind the cause and the effect

And you who were bewildered by a meaning
Whose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed â
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

"You Have Loved Enough"

I said Iâd be your lover.
You laughed at what I said.
I lost my job forever.
I was counted with the dead.

I swept the marble chambers,
But you sent me down below.
You kept me from believing
Until you let me know:

That I am not the one who loves â
Itâs love that seizes me.
When hatred with his package comes,
You forbid delivery.

And when the hunger for your touch 
Rises from the hunger,
You whisper, "You have loved enough,
Now let me be the Lover."

I swept the marble chambers,
But you sent me down below.
You kept me from believing
Until you let me know:

That I am not the one who loves â
Itâs love that chooses me.
When hatred with his package comes,
You forbid delivery.

And when the hunger for your touch
Rises from the hunger . . .

"Boogie Street"

O Crown of Light, O Darkened One,
I never thought weâd meet.
You kiss my lips, and then itâs done:
Iâm back on Boogie Street.

A sip of wine, a cigarette,
And then itâs time to go.
I tidied up the kitchenette;
I tuned the old banjo.
Iâm wanted at the traffic-jam.
Theyâre saving me a seat.
Iâm what I am, and what I am,
Is back on Boogie Street.

And O my love, I still recall
The pleasures that we knew;
The rivers and the waterfall,
Wherein I bathed with you.
Bewildered by your beauty there,
Iâd kneel to dry your feet.
By such instructions you prepare
A man for Boogie Street.

O Crown of Light, O Darkened Oneâ¦

So come, my friends, be not afraid.
We are so lightly here.
It is in love that we are made;
In love we disappear.
Thoâ all the maps of blood and flesh
Are posted on the door,
Thereâs no one who has told us yet
What Boogie Street is for.

O Crown of Light, O Darkened One,
I never thought weâd meet.
You kiss my lips, and then itâs done:
Iâm back on Boogie Street.

A sip of wine, a cigarette,
And then itâs time to go . . .

"The Land Of Plenty"

Donât really know who sent me
To raise my voice and say:
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day.

I donât know why I come here,
Knowing as I do,
What you really think of me,
What I really think of you.

For the millions in a prison,
That wealth has set apart â
For the Christ who has not risen,
From the caverns of the heart â

For the innermost decision,
That we cannot but obey -
For whatâs left of our religion,
I lift my voice and pray:
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day.

I know I said Iâd meet you,
Iâd meet you at the store,
But I canât buy it, baby.
I canât buy it anymore.

And I donât really know who sent me,
To raise my voice and say:
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day.

I donât know why I come here,
knowing as I do,
what you really think of me,
what I really think of you.

For the innermost decision
That we cannot but obey
For whatâs left of our religion
I lift my voice and pray:
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day.

"Go No More A-Roving"

[Dedicated to Irving Layton]

So we'll go no more a-roving
So late into the night,
Though the heart be still as loving,
And the moon be still as bright.
For the sword outwears its sheath,
And the soul outwears the breast,
And the heart must pause to breathe,
And love itself have rest.
Though the night was made for loving,
And the day returns too soon,
Yet we'll go no more a-roving
By the light of the moon.

"Because Of"

Because of a few songs
Wherein I spoke of their mystery,
Women have been
Exceptionally kind
to my old age.
They make a secret place
In their busy lives
And they take me there.
They become naked
In their different ways
and they say,
"Look at me, Leonard
Look at me one last time."
Then they bend over the bed
And cover me up
Like a baby that is shivering.

"The Letters"

You never liked to get
The letters that I sent.
But now you've got the gist
Of what my letters meant.
You're reading them again,
The ones you didn't burn.
You press them to your lips,
My pages of concern.
I said there'd been a flood.
I said there's nothing left.
I hoped that you would come.
I gave you my address.
Your story was so long,
The plot was so intense,
It took you years to cross
The lines of self-defense.
The wounded forms appear:
The loss, the full extent;
And simple kindness here,
The solitude of strength.
You walk into my room.
You stand there at my desk,
Begin your letter to
The one who's coming next.

"Undertow"

I set out one night
When the tide was low
There were signs in the sky
But I did not know
I'd be caught in the grip
Of the undertow
Ditched on a beach
Where the sea hates to go
With a child in my arms
And a chill in my soul
And my heart the shape
Of a begging bowl

"Morning Glory"

No words this time?
No words.
No, there are times when nothing can be done.
Not this time.
Is it censorship?
Is it censorship?
No, it's evaporation.
No, it's evaporation.
Is this leading somewhere?
Yes.
We're going down the lane.
Is this going somewhere?
Into the garden.
Into the backyard.
We're walking down the driveway.
Are we moving towards....
We're in the backyard.
...some transcendental moment?
It's almost light.
That's right. 
That's it.
Are we moving towards some transcendental moment?
That's right.
That's it.
Do you think you'll be able to pull it off?
Yes. Do you think you can pull it off?
Yes, it might happen.
I'm all ears.
I'm all ears.
Oh the morning glory!

"On That Day"

Some people say
It's what we deserve
For sins against g-d
For crimes in the world
I wouldn't know
I'm just holding the fort
Since that day
They wounded New York
Some people say
They hate us of old
Our women unveiled
Our slaves and our gold
I wouldn't know
I'm just holding the fort
But answer me this
I won't take you to court
Did you go crazy
Or did you report
On that day
On that day
They wounded New York

"Villanelle For Our Time"

From bitter searching of the heart,
Quickened with passion and with pain
We rise to play a greater part.
This is the faith from which we start:
Men shall know commonwealth again
From bitter searching of the heart.
We loved the easy and the smart,
But now, with keener hand and brain,
We rise to play a greater part.
The lesser loyalties depart,
And neither race nor creed remain
From bitter searching of the heart.
Not steering by the venal chart
That tricked the mass for private gain,
We rise to play a greater part.
Reshaping narrow law and art
Whose symbols are the millions slain,
From bitter searching of the heart
We rise to play a greater part.

"There For You"

When it all went down
And the pain came through
I get it now
I was there for you
Don't ask me how
I know it's true
I get it now
I was there for you
I make my plans
Like I always do
But when I look back
I was there for you
I walk the streets
Like I used to do
And I freeze with fear
But I'm there for you
I see my life
In full review
It was never me
It was always you
You sent me here
You sent me there
Breaking things
I can't repair
Making objects
Out of thoughts
Making more
By thinking not
Eating food
And drinking wine
A body that
I thought was mine
Dressed as Arab
Dressed as Jew
O mask of iron
I was there for you
Moods of glory
Moods so foul
The world comes through
A bloody towel
And death is old
But it's always new
I freeze with fear
And I'm there for you
I see it clear
I always knew
It was never me
I was there for you
I was there for you
My darling one
And by your law
It all was done

"Dear Heather"

Dear Heather
Please walk by me again
With a drink in your hand
And your legs all white
From the winter

"Nightingale"

[Dedicated to Carl Anderson (1945-2004)]

I built my house beside the wood
So I could hear you singing
And it was sweet and it was good
And love was all beginning
Fare thee well my nightingale
'Twas long ago I found you
Now all your songs of beauty fail
The forest closes 'round you
The sun goes down behind a veil
'Tis now that you would call me
So rest in peace my nightingale
Beneath your branch of holly
Fare thee well my nightingale
I lived but to be near you
Tho' you are singing somewhere still
I can no longer hear you

"To A Teacher"

[Dedicated to A. M. Klein (1909-1972)]

Hurt once and for all into silence.
A long pain ending without a song to prove it.
Who could stand beside you so close to Eden,
When you glinted in every eye the held-high
razor, shivering every ram and son?
And now the silent loony bin, where
The shadows live in the rafters like
Day-weary bats,
Until the turning mind, a radar signal,
lures them to exaggerate
Mountain-size on the white stone wall
Your tiny limp.
How can I leave you in such a house?
Are there no more saints and wizards
to praise their ways with pupils,
No more evil to stun with the slap
of a wet red tongue?
Did you confuse the Messiah in a mirror
and rest because he had finally come?
Let me cry Help beside you, Teacher.
I have entered under this dark roof
As fearlessly as an honoured son
Enters his father's house.

"The Faith"

[Based on a Quebec folk song]

The sea so deep and blind
The sun, the wild regret
The club, the wheel, the mind,
O love, aren't you tired yet?
The club, the wheel, the mind
O love, aren't you tired yet?
The blood, the soil, the faith
These words you can't forget
Your vow, your holy place
O love, aren't you tired yet?
The blood, the soil, the faith
O love, aren't you tired yet?
A cross on every hill
A star, a minaret
So many graves to fill
O love, aren't you tired yet?
So many graves to fill
O love, aren't you tired yet?
The sea so deep and blind
Where still the sun must set
And time itself unwind
O love, aren't you tired yet?
And time itself unwind
O love, aren't you tired yet?

"Tennessee Waltz (Live)"

I was dancing with my darlin'
to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
Introduced him to my loved one
and while they were waltzing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me.
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes I lost my little darlin'
The night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz.
She comes dancing through the darkness
To the Tennessee Waltz
And I feel like I'm falling apart
And it's stronger than drink
And it's deeper than sorrow
This darkness she's left in my heart.

"Going Home"

I'd love to speak with Leonard
He's a sportsman and a shepherd
He's a lazy bastard
Living in a suit

But he does say what I tell him
Even though it isn't welcome
He just doesn't have the freedom
To refuse

He will speak these words of wisdom
Like a sage, a man of vision
Though he knows he's really nothing
But the brief elaboration of a tube

Going home without my sorrow
Going home sometime tomorrow
Going home to where it's better
Than before

Going home without my burden
Going home behind the curtain
Going home without this costume
That I wore

He wants to write a love song
An anthem of forgiving
A manual for living
With defeat

A cry above the suffering
A sacrifice recovering
But that isn't what I need him
To complete

I want him to be certain
That he doesn't have a burden
That he doesn't need a vision
That he only has permission
To do my instant bidding which is to
Say what I have told him to repeat

Going home without my sorrow
Going home sometime tomorrow
Going home to where it's better than before

Going home without my burden
Going home behind the curtain
Going home without the costume that I wore

I'm going home without my sorrow
Going home sometime tomorrow
Going home to where it's better than before

Going home without my burden
Going home behind the curtain
Going home without this costume that I wore

I love to speak with Leonard
He's a sportsman and a shepherd
He's a lazy bastard living in a suit

"Amen"

Tell me again
When I've been to the river
And I've taken the edge off my thirst
Tell me again
We're alone and I'm listening
I'm listening so hard that it hurts
Tell me again
When I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again
When I've seen through the horror
Tell me again
Tell me over and over
Tell me that you want me then
Amen...

Tell me again
When the victims are singing
And the Laws of Remorse are restored
Tell me again
That you know what I'm thinking
But vengeance belongs to the Lord
Tell me again
When I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again
When I've seen through the horror
Tell me again
Tell me over and over
Tell me that you love me then
Amen...

Tell me again
When the day has been ransomed
And the night has no right to begin
Try me again
When the angels are panting
And scratching at the door to come in
Tell me again
When I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again
When I've seen through the horror
Tell me again
Tell me over and over
Tell me that you need me then
Amen...

Tell me again
When the filth of the butcher
Is washed in the blood of the lamb
Tell me again
When the rest of the culture
Has passed through the Eye of the Camp
Tell me again
When I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again
When I've seen through the horror
Tell me again
Tell me over and over
Tell me that you love me then
Amen...

"Show Me The Place"

Show me the place where you want your slave to go
Show me the place I've forgotten I don't know
Show me the place where my head is bendin' low
Show me the place where you want your slave to go

Show me the place, help me roll away the stone
Show me the place, I can't move this thing alone
Show me the place where the word became a man
Show me the place where the suffering began

The troubles came I saved what I could save
A thread of light, a particle, a wave
But there were chains, so I hastened to behave
There were chains, so I loved you like a slave

Show me the place where you want your slave to go
Show me the place I've forgotten I don't know
Show me the place where my head is bendin' low
Show me the place where you want your slave to go

The troubles came I saved what I could save
A thread of light, a particle, a wave
But there were chains, so I hastened to behave
There were chains, so I loved you like a slave

Show me the place
Show me the place
Show me the place

Show me the place, help me roll away the stone
Show me the place, I can't move this thing alone
Show me the place where the word became a man
Show me the place where the suffering began

"Darkness"

I caught the darkness
It was drinking from your cup
I caught the darkness
I'm drinking from your cup
I said: Is this contagious?
You said: Just drink it up

I got no future
I know my days are few
The present's not that pleasant
Just a lot of things to do
I thought the past would last me
But the darkness got that too

I should have seen it coming
It was right behind your eyes
You were young and it was summer
I just had to take a dive
Winning you was easy
But darkness was the prize

I don't smoke no cigarette
I don't drink no alcohol
I ain't had much loving yet
But that's always been your call
Hey I don't miss it baby
I got no taste for anything at all

I used to love the rainbow
And I used to love the view
I loved the early morning
I'd pretend that it was new
But I caught the darkness baby
And I got it worse than you

I caught the darkness
It was drinking from your cup
I caught the darkness
I'm drinking from your cup
I said: Is this contagious?
You said: Just drink it up

"Anyhow"

I know it really is a pity
The way you treat me now
I know you canât forgive me
But forgive me anyhow
The ending got so ugly
I even heard you say
You never ever loved me
But could you love me anyway

I dreamed about you baby
You were wearing half your dress
I know you have to hate me
But could you hate me less?
I used up all my chances
And youâll never take me back
But there ainât no harm in asking
Could you cut me one more slack?

Iâm naked and Iâm filthy
And thereâs sweat upon my brow
And both of us are guilty
Anyhow
Have mercy on me baby
After all I did confess
Even though you have to hate me
Could you hate me less?

Itâs a shame and itâs a pity
I know you canât forgive me
The ending got so ugly
You never ever loved me
Dreamed about you baby
I know you have to hate me
Iâm naked and Iâm filthy
And both of us are guilty
Anyhow
Have mercy on me baby

"Crazy To Love You"

Had to go crazy to love you
Had to go down to the pit
Had to do time in the tower
Begging my crazy to quit

Had to go crazy to love you
You who were never the one
Whom I chased through the souvenir heartache
Her braids and her blouse all undone

Sometimes Iâd head for the highway
Iâm old and the mirrors donât lie
But crazy has places to hide in
That are deeper than any goodbye

Had to go crazy to love you
Had to let everything fall
Had to be people I hated
Had to be no one at all

Iâm tired of choosing desire
I been saved by a blessed fatigue
The gates of commitment unwired
And nobody trying to leave

Sometimes Iâd head for the highway
Iâm old and the mirrors donât lie
But crazy has places to hide in
That are deeper than any goodbye

Had to go crazy to love you
You who were never the one
Whom I chased through the souvenir heartache
Her braids and her blouse all undone

"Come Healing"

O gather up the brokenness
And bring it to me now
The fragrance of those promises
You never dared to vow

The splinters that you carry
The cross you left behind
Come healing of the body
Come healing of the mind

And let the heavens hear it
The penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb

Behold the gates of mercy
In arbitrary space
And none of us deserving
The cruelty or the grace

O solitude of longing
Where love has been confined
Come healing of the body
Come healing of the mind

O see the darkness yielding
That tore the light apart
Come healing of the reason
Come healing of the heart

O troubled dust concealing
An undivided love
The Heart beneath is teaching
To the broken Heart above

O let the heavens falter
And let the earth proclaim:
Come healing of the Altar
Come healing of the Name

O longing of the branches
To lift the little bud
O longing of the arteries
To purify the blood

And let the heavens hear it
The penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb

O let the heavens hear it
The penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb

"Banjo"

Thereâs something that Iâm watching
Means a lot to me
Itâs a broken banjo bobbing
On the dark infested sea

Donât know how it got there
Maybe taken by the wave
Off of someoneâs shoulder
Or out of someoneâs grave

Itâs coming for me darling
No matter where I go
Its duty is to harm me
My duty is to know

Thereâs something that Iâm watching
Means a lot to me
Itâs a broken banjo bobbing
On the dark infested sea

"Lullaby"

Sleep baby sleep
The dayâs on the run
The wind in the trees
Is talking in tongues

If your heart is torn
I donât wonder why
If the night is long
Hereâs my lullaby
Hereâs my lullaby

Well the mouse ate the crumb
Then the cat ate the crust
Now theyâve fallen in love
Theyâre talking in tongues

If your heart is torn
I donât wonder why
If the night is long
Hereâs my lullaby
Hereâs my lullaby

Sleep baby sleep
Thereâs a morning to come
The wind in the trees
Theyâre talking in tongues

If your heart is torn
I donât wonder why
If the night is long
Hereâs my lullaby
Hereâs my lullaby

"Different Sides"

We find ourselves on different sides
Of a line nobody drew
Though it all may be one in the higher eye
Down here where we live it is two

I to my side call the meek and the mild
You to your side call the Word
By virtue of suffering I claim to have won
You claim to have never been heard

Both of us say there are laws to obey
But frankly I donât like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
I want to leave it alone

The pull of the moon, the thrust of the sun
And thus the ocean is crossed
The waters are blessed while a shadowy guest
Kindles a light for the lost

Both of us say there are laws to obey
But frankly I donât like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
I want to leave it alone

Down in the valley the famine goes on
The famine up on the hill
I say that you shouldnât, you couldnât, you canât
You say that you must and you will

Both of us say there are laws to obey
But frankly I donât like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
I want to leave it alone

You want to live where the suffering is
I want to get out of town
Câmon baby give me a kiss
Stop writing everything down

Both of us say there are laws to obey
Yeah, but frankly I donât like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
I want to leave it alone

Both of us say there are laws to obey
But frankly I donât like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
I want to leave it alone

"Slow"

Iâm slowing down the tune
I never liked it fast
You want to get there soon
I want to get there last

Itâs not because Iâm old
Itâs not the life I led
I always liked it slow
Thatâs what my momma said

Iâm lacing up my shoe
But I donât want to run
Iâll get here when I do
Donât need no starting gun

Itâs not because Iâm old
Itâs not what dying does
I always liked it slow
Slow is in my blood

I always liked it slow:
I never liked it fast
With you itâs got to go:
With me itâs got to last

Itâs not because Iâm old
Itâs not because Iâm dead
I always liked it slow
Thatâs what my momma said

All your moves are swift
All your turns are tight
Let me catch my breath
I thought we had all night

I like to take my time
I like to linger as it flies
A weekend on your lips
A lifetime in your eyes

I always liked it slow...

Iâm slowing down the tune
I never liked it fast
You want to get there soon
I want to get there last

So baby let me go
Youâre wanted back in town
In case they want to know
Iâm just trying to slow it down

"Almost Like The Blues"

I saw some people starving
There was murder, there was rape
Their villages were burning
They were trying to escape
I couldn't meet their glances
I was staring at my shoes
It was acid, it was tragic
It was almost like the blues

I have to die a little
Between each murderous thought
And when I'm finished thinking
I have to die a lot
There's torture and there's killing
And there's all my bad reviews
The war, the children missing
Lord, it's almost like the blues

So I let my heart get frozen
To keep away the rot
My father says I'm chosen
My mother says I'm not
I listened to their story
Of the Gypsies and the Jews
It was good, it wasn't boring
It was almost like the blues

There is no God in Heaven
And there is no Hell below
So says the great professor
Of all there is to know
But I've had the invitation
That a sinner can't refuse
And it's almost like salvation
It's almost like the blues

"Samson In New Orleans"

You said that you were with me
You said you were my friend
Did you really love the city
Or did you just pretend

You said you loved her secrets
And her freedoms hid away
She was better than America
Thatâs what I heard you say

You said how could this happen
You said how can this be
The remnant all dishonored
On the bridge of misery

And we who cried for mercy
From the bottom of the pit
Was our prayer so damn unworthy
The Son rejected it?

So gather up the killers
Get everyone in town
Stand me by those pillars
Let me take this temple down

The king so kind and solemn
He wears a bloody crown
So stand me by that column
Let me take this temple down

You said how could this happen
You said how can this be
The chains are gone from heaven
The storms are wild and free

Thereâs other ways to answer
That certainly is true
Me, Iâm blind with death and anger
And thatâs no place for you

Thereâs a woman in the window
And a bed in Tinsel Town
Iâll write you when itâs over
Let me take this temple down

"A Street"

I used to be your favorite drunk
Good for one more laugh
Then we both ran out of luck
Luck was all we ever had
You put on a uniform
To fight the Civil War
You looked so good I didnât care
What side youâre fighting for

It wasnât all that easy
When you up and walked away
But Iâll save that little story
For another rainy day
I know the burdenâs heavy
As you wheel it through the night
Some people say itâs empty
But that donât mean itâs light

You left me with the dishes
And a baby in the bath
Youâre tight with the militias
You wear their camouflage
You always said weâre equal
So let me march with you
Just an extra in the sequel
To the old red white and blue

Baby donât ignore me
We were smokers we were friends
Forget that tired story
Of betrayal and revenge
I see the Ghost of Culture
With numbers on his wrist
Salute some new conclusion
Which all of us have missed

I cried for you this morning
And Iâll cry for you again
But Iâm not in charge of sorrow
So please donât ask me when
There may be wine and roses
And magnums of champagne
But weâll never no weâll never
Ever be that drunk again

The partyâs over
But Iâve landed on my feet
Iâll be standing on this corner
Where there used to be a street

"Did I Ever Love You"

Did I ever love you
Did I ever need you
Did I ever fight you
Did I ever want to

Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
Are we still leaning
Across the old table

Did I ever love you...

Was it ever settled
Was it ever over
And is it still raining
Back in November

The lemon trees blossom
The almond trees wither
Was I ever someone
Who could love you forever

Was it ever settled
Was it ever over
And is it still raining
Back in November

The lemon trees blossom
The almond trees wither
It's Spring and it's Summer
And it's Winter forever

Did I ever love you
Does it really matter
Did I ever fight you
You don't need to answer

Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
Are we still leaning
Across the old table

Did I ever love you...

"My Oh My"

Wasnât hard to love you
Didnât have to try
Wasnât hard to love you
Didnât have to try
Held you for a little while
My Oh My Oh My

Drove you to the station
Never asked you why
Drove you to the station
Never asked you why
Held you for a little while
My Oh My Oh My

All the boys are waving
Trying to catch your eye
All the boys are waving
Trying to catch your eye
Held you for a little while
My Oh My Oh My

Wasnât hard to love you
Didnât have to try
Wasnât hard to love you
Didnât have to try
Held you for a little while
My Oh My Oh My

"Nevermind"

The war was lost
The treaty signed
I was not caught
I crossed the line

I was not caught
Though many tried
I live among you
Well disguised

I had to leave
My life behind
I dug some graves
You'll never find

The story's told
With facts and lies
I had a name
But never mind

Never mind
Never mind
The war was lost
The treaty signed

There's truth that lives
And truth that dies
I don't know which
So never mind

Ø§ÙØ³ÙØ§Ù Ø¹ÙÙ Ø§ÙØ³ÙØ§Ù ÙØ§ Ø³ÙØ§Ù
Ø³ÙØ§Ù Ø³ÙØ§Ù Ø¹ÙÙ Ø§ÙØ³ÙØ§Ù

Your victory
Was so complete
That some among you
Thought to keep

A record of
Our little lives
The clothes we wore
Our spoons our knives

The games of luck
Our soldiers played
The stones we cut
The songs we made

Our law of peace
Which understands
A husband leads
A wife commands

And all of this
Expressions of
The Sweet Indifference
Some call Love

The High Indifference
Some call Fate
But we had Names
More intimate

Names so deep and
Names so true
They're blood to me
They're dust to you

There is no need
That this survive
There's truth that lives
And truth that dies

Never mind
Never mind
I live the life
I left behind

There's truth that lives
And truht that dies
I don't know which
So never mind

Ø³ÙØ§Ù Ø³ÙØ§Ù Ø¹ÙÙ Ø§ÙØ³ÙØ§Ù

I could not kill
The way you kill
I could not hate
I tried I failed

You turned me in
At least you tried
You side with them
Whom you despise

This was your heart
This swarm of flies
This was once your mouth
This bowl of lies

You serve them well
I'm not surprised
You're of their kin
You're of their kind

Never mind
Never mind
I had to leave
My life behind
The story's told
With facts and lies
You own the world
So never mind

Never mind
Never mind
I live the life
I left behind

I live it full
I live it wide
Through layers of time
You can't divide

My woman's here
My children too
Their graves are safe
From ghosts like you

In places deep
With roots entwined
I live the life I left behind

The war was lost
The treaty signed
I was not caught
I crossed the line

I was not caught
Though many tried
I live among you
Well disguised

"Born In Chains"

[SHARON, HATTIE AND CHARLEY:]
I was born...

[LEONARD:]
I was born in chains but I was taken out of Egypt
I was bound to a burden, but the burden it was raised
Oh Lord I can no longer keep this secret
Blessed is the name, the name be praised.

[SHARON:]
I fled to the edge of the mighty sea of sorrow
Pursued by the riders of a cruel and dark regime
But the waters parted and my soul crossed over
Out of Egypt, out of Pharaohâs dream

[LEONARD:]
Word of words and the measure of all measures
Blessed is the name, the name be blessed
Written on my heart in burning letters
Thatâs all I know, I do not know the rest

[HATTIE:]
I was idle with my soul, when I heard that you could use me
I followed very closely, but my life remained the same
But then you showed me where you had been wounded
In every atom broken is the Name

[CHARLEY:]
I was alone on the road, your love was so confusing
And all my teachers told me that I had myself to blame
But in the grip of sensual illusion
A sweet unknowing unified the name

[LEONARD:]
Word of words, and the measure of all measures
Blessed is the name, the name be blessed
Written on my heart in burning letters
Thatâs all I know, I cannot read the rest

[LEONARD:]
I've heard the soul unfolds in the chambers of its longing
And the bitter liquor sweetens in the hammered  cup
Ah but all the ladders of the night have fallen
Just darkness now, to lift the longing up

[LEONARD:]
Word of words and measure of all measures
Blessed is the name, the name be blessed
Written on my heart in burning letters
Thatâs all I know, I cannot read the rest

[SHARON, HATTIE AND CHARLEY:]
Just darkness now, to lift the spirit up

"You Got Me Singing"

You got me singing
Even tho' the news is bad
You got me singing
The only song I ever had

You got me singing
Ever since the river died
You got me thinking
Of the places we could hide

You got me singing
Even though the world is gone
You got me thinking
I'd like to carry on

You got me singing
Even tho' it all looks grim
You got me singing
The Hallelujah hymn

You got me singing
Like a prisoner in a jail
You got me singing
Like my pardon's in the mail

You got me wishing
Our little love would last
You got me thinking
Like those people of the past

You got me singing
Even though the world is gone
You got me thinking
I'd like to carry on

You got me singing
Even tho' it all went wrong
You got me singing
The Hallelujah song

"You Want It Darker"

If you are the dealer, I'm out of the game
If you are the healer, it means I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory then mine must be the shame
You want it darker
We kill the flame

Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name
Vilified, crucified, in the human frame
A million candles burning for the help that never came
You want it darker

Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my lord

There's a lover in the story
But the story's still the same
There's a lullaby for suffering
And a paradox to blame
But it's written in the scriptures
And it's not some idle claim
You want it darker
We kill the flame

They're lining up the prisoners
And the guards are taking aim
I struggled with some demons
They were middle class and tame
I didn't know I had permission to murder and to maim
You want it darker

Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my lord

Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name
Vilified, crucified, in the human frame
A million candles burning for the love that never came
You want it darker
We kill the flame

If you are the dealer, let me out of the game
If you are the healer, I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory, mine must be the shame
You want it darker

Hineni, hineni
Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my lord

Hineni
Hineni, hineni
Hineni

"Treaty"

I've seen you change the water into wine
I've seen you change it back to water, too
I sit at your table every night
I try but I just don't get high with you
I wish there was a treaty we could sign
I do not care who takes this bloody hill
I'm angry and I'm tired all the time
I wish there was a treaty, I wish there was a treaty
Between your love and mine

Ah, they're dancing in the street â it's Jubilee
We sold ourselves for love but now we're free
I'm so sorry for that ghost I made you be
Only one of us was real and that was me

I haven't said a word since you been gone
That any liar couldn't say as well
I just can't believe the static coming on
You were my ground, my safe and sound
You were my aerial

Ah, the fields are crying out â it's Jubilee
We sold ourselves for love but now we're free
I'm so sorry for that ghost I made you be
Only one of us was real and that was me

I heard the snake was baffled by his sin
He shed his scales to find the snake within
But born again is born without a skin
The poison enters into everything

And I wish there was a treaty we could sign
I do not care who takes this bloody hill
I'm angry and I'm tired all the time
I wish there was a treaty, I wish there was a treaty
Between your love and mine

"On The Level"

I knew that it was wrong
I didn't have a doubt
I was dying to get back home
And you were starting out

I said I'd best be moving on
You said, we have all day
You smiled at me like I was young
It took my breath away

Your crazy fragrance all around
Your secrets all in view
My lost, my lost was saying found
My don't was saying do

Let's keep it on the level
When I walked away from you
I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too

They oughta give my heart a medal
For letting go of you
When I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too

Now I'm living in this temple
Where they tell you what to do
I'm old and I've had to settle
On a different point of view

I was fighting with temptation
But I didn't want to win
A man like me don't like to see
Temptation caving in

Your crazy fragrance all around
Your secrets in my view
My lost, my lost was saying found
My don't was saying do

Let's keep it on the level
When I walked away from you
I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too

They ought to give my heart a medal
For letting go of you
When I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too

They ought to give my heart a medal
For letting go of you
When I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too

"Leaving The Table"

I'm leaving the table
I'm out of the game
I don't know the people
In your picture frame
If I ever loved you or no, no
It's a crying shame if I ever loved you
If I knew your name

You don't need a lawyer
I'm not making a claim
You don't need to surrender
I'm not taking aim
I don't need a lover, no, no
The wretched beast is tame
I don't need a lover
So blow out the flame

There's nobody missing
There is no reward
Little by little
We're cutting the cord
We're spending the treasure, oh, no, no
That love cannot afford
I know you can feel it
The sweetness restored

I don't need a reason
For what I became
I've got these excuses
They're tired and lame
I don't need a pardon, no, no, no, no, no
There's no one left to blame
I'm leaving the table
I'm out of the game

I'm leaving the table
I'm out of the game

"If I Didn't Have Your Love"

If the sun would lose its light
And we lived an endless night
And there was nothing left that you could feel
That's how it would be
What my life would seem to me
If I didn't have your love to make it real

If the stars were all unpinned
And a cold and bitter wind
Swallowed up the world without a trace
Ah, well that's where I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I couldn't lift the veil and see your face

And if no leaves were on the tree
And no water in the sea
And the break of day had nothing to reveal
That's how broken I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I didn't have your love to make it real

If the sun would lose its light
And we lived in an endless night
And there was nothing left that you could feel
If the sea were sand alone
And the flowers made of stone
And no one that you hurt could ever heal
Well that's how broken I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I didn't have your love to make it real

"Traveling Light"

I'm traveling light
It's au revoir
My once so bright, my fallen star
I'm running late, they'll close the bar
I used to play one mean guitar
I guess I'm just somebody who
Has given up on the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light like we used to do

Good night, good night, my fallen star
I guess you're right, you always are
I know you're right about the blues
You live some life you'd never choose
I'm just a fool, a dreamer who forgot to dream of the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light like we used to do

Traveling light
It's au revoir
My once so bright, my fallen star
I'm running late, they'll close the bar
I used to play one mean guitar
I guess I'm just somebody who
Has given up on the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light like we used to do

But if the road leads back to you
Must I forget the things I knew
When I was friends with one or two
Traveling light like we used to do
I'm traveling light

"It Seemed The Better Way"

It seemed the better way
When first I heard him speak
Now it's much too late
To turn the other cheek

Sounded like the truth
Seemed the better way
Sounded like the truth
But it's not the truth today

I wonder what it was
I wonder what it meant
First he touched on love
Then he touched on death

Sounded like the truth
Seemed the better way
Sounded like the truth
But it's not the truth today

I better hold my tongue
I better take my place
Lift this glass of blood
Try to say the grace

Seemed the better way
When first I heard him speak
But now it's much too late
To turn the other cheek

Sounded like the truth
Seemed the better way
Sounded like the truth
But it's not the truth today

I better hold my tongue
I better take my place
Lift this glass of blood
Try to say the grace

"Steer Your Way"

Steer your way past the ruins of the Altar and the Mall
Steer your way through the fables of Creation and The Fall
Steer your way past the Palaces that rise above the rot
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought

Steer your heart past the Truth that you believed in yesterday
Such as Fundamental Goodness and the Wisdom of the Way
Steer your heart, precious heart, past the women whom you bought
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought

Steer your way through the pain that is far more real than you
That smashed the Cosmic Model, that blinded every view
And please don't make me go there, though there be a God or not
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought

They whisper still, the ancient stones, the blunted mountains weep
As he died to make men holy, let us die to make things cheap
And say the Mea Culpa, which you probably forgot
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought

Steer your way, O my heart, though I have no right to ask
To the one who was never, never equal to the task
Who knows he's been convicted, who knows he will be shot
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought

They whisper still, the ancient stones, the blunted mountains weep
As he died to make men holy, let us die to make things cheap
And say your Mea Culpa, which you gradually forgot
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought

"String Reprise / Treaty"

I wish there was a treaty we could sign
It's over now, the water and the wine
We were broken then but now we're borderline
And I wish there was a treaty, I wish there was a treaty between your love and mine

"Happens To The Heart"

I was always working steady
But I never called it art
I got my shit together
Meeting Christ and reading Marx
It failed my little fire
But it's bright the dying spark
Go tell the young messiah
What happens to the heart

There's a mist of summer kisses
Where I tried to double-park
The rivalry was vicious
The women were in charge
It was nothing, it was business
But it left an ugly mark
I've come here to revisit
What happens to the heart

I was selling holy trinkets
I was dressing kind of sharp
Had a pussy in the kitchen
And a panther in the yard

In the prison of the gifted
I was friendly with the guards
So I never had to witness
What happens to the heart

I should have seen it coming
After all I knew the chart
Just to look at her was trouble
It was trouble from the start
Sure we played a stunning couple
But I never liked the part
It ain't pretty, it ain't subtle
What happens to the heart

Now the angel's got a fiddle
The devil's got a harp
Every soul is like a minnow
Every mind is like a shark
I've broken every window
But the house, the house is dark
I care but very little
What happens to the heart

Then I studied with this beggar
He was filthy, he was scarred
By the claws of many women
He had failed to disregard
No fable here no lesson
No singing meadowlark
Just a filthy beggar guessing
What happens to the heart

I was always working steady
But I never called it art
It was just some old convention
Like the horse before the cart
I had no trouble betting
On the flood, against the ark
You see, I knew about the ending
What happens to the heart

I was handy with a rifle
My father's .303
I fought for something final
Not the right to disagree

"Moving On"

I loved your face I loved your hair
Your t-shirts and your evening-wear
As for the world the job the war
I ditched them all to love you more

And now you're gone, now you're gone
As if there ever was a you
Who broke the heart and made it new?
Who's moving on, who's kiddin' who?

I loved your moods I love the way
They threaten every single day
Your beauty ruled me though I knew
Twas more hormonal than the view

Now you're gone, now you're gone
As if there ever was a you
Queen of lilac, queen of blue
Who's moving on, who's kiddin' who?

I loved your face I loved your hair
Your t-shirts and your evening-wear
As for the world the job the war
I ditched them all to love you more

And now you're gone, now you're gone
As if there ever was a you
Who held me dyin' pulled me through
Who's moving on, who's kiddin' who?

Who's moving on, who's kiddin' who?

"The Night Of Santiago"

She said she was a maiden
That wasn't what I heard
For the sake of conversation
I took her at her word
The lights went out behind us
The fireflies undressed
The broken sidewalk ended
I touched her sleeping breasts
They opened to me urgently
Likelilies from the dead
Behind a fine embroidery
Her nipples rose like bread
Then I took off my necktie
And she took off her dress
My belt and pistol set aside
We tore away the rest

The night of Santiago
And I was passing through
So I took her to the river
As any man would do

Her thighs they slipped away from me
Like schools of startled fish
Though I've forgotten half my life
I still remember this
Now, as a man I won't repeat
The things she said aloud
Except for this, my lips are sealed forever
And for now
And soon there's sand in every kiss
And soon the dawn is ready
And soon the night surrenders
To a daffodil machete
I gave her something pretty
And I waited till she laughed
I wasn't born a gypsy
To make a woman sad

The night of Santiago
And I was passing through
I took her to the river
As any man would do
The night of Santiago
And I was passing through
I took her to the river
As any man would do

I didn't fall in love of course
It's never up to you
But she was walking back and forth
And I was passing through
When I took her to the river
In her virginal apparel
When I took her to the river
On that night of Santiago
And yes she lied about it all
Her children and her husband
You were born to judge the world
Forgive me but I wasn't

The night of Santiago
And I was passing through
So I took her to the river
As any man would do

The night of Santiago
And I was passing through
So I took her to the river
As any man would do

The night of Santiago
And I was passing through
So I took her to the river
As any man would do

"Thanks For The Dance"

Thanks for the dance
I'm sorry you're tired
The evening has hardly begun

Thanks for the dance
Try to look inspired
One-two-three, one-two-three, one

There is a rose in your hair
Your shoulders are bare
You've been wearing this costume forever
So turn up the music
Pour out the wine
Stop at the surface
The surface is fine
We don't need to go any deeper

Thanks for the dance
I hear that we're married
One-two-three, one-two-three, one
Thanks for the dance
And the baby you carried
It was almost a daughter or a son

And there's nothing to do
But to wonder if you
Are as hopeless as me
And as decent
We're joined in the spirit
Joined at the hip
Joined in the panic
Wondering if
We've come to some sort
Of agreement

It was fine, it was fast
We were first, we were last
In line at the
Temple of Pleasure
But the green was so green
And the blue was so blue
I was so I
And you were so you
The crisis was light
As a feather

Thanks for the dance
It was hell, it was swell, it was fun
Thanks for all the dances
One-two-three, one-two-three, one

"It's Torn"

I see you in windows that open so wide
There's nothing beyond them and no one inside
You kick off your sandals and shake out your hair
The salt on your shoulders like sparks in the air
There's silt on your ankles and sand on your feet
The river too shallow, the ocean too deep
You smile at your suffering, the sweetest reprieve
Why did you leave us, why did you leave

You kick off your sandals and shake out your hair
It's torn where you're dancing, it's torn everywhere
It's torn on the right and it's torn on the left
It's torn in the center which few can accept

It's torn where there's beauty, it's torn where there's death
It's torn where there's mercy but torn somewhat less
It's torn in the highest from kingdom to crown
The messages fly but the network is down
Bruised at the shoulder and cut at the wrist
The sea rushes home to its thimble of mist
The opposites falter, the spirals reverse
And Eve must re-enter the sleep of her birth
And up through the system the worlds are withdrawn
From every dominion the mind stood upon
And now that it's over and now that it's done
The name has no number, not even the one

Come gather the pieces all scattered and lost
The lie in what's holy, the light in what's not
The story's been written the letter's been sealed
You gave me a lily but now it's a field

You kick off your sandals and shake out your hair
It's torn where you're dancing, it's torn everywhere

"The Goal"

I can't leave my house
Or answer the phone
I'm going down again
But I'm not alone

Settling at last
Accounts of the soul
This for the trash
That paid in full

As for the fall, it
Began long ago
Can't stop the rain
Can't stop the snow

I sit in my chair
I look at the street
The neighbor returns
My smile of defeat

I move with the leaves
I shine with the chrome
I'm almost alive
I'm almost at home

No one to follow
And nothing to teach
Except that the goal
Falls short of the reach

"Puppets"

German puppets burned the Jews
Jewish puppets did not choose
Puppet vultures eat the dead
Puppet corpses they are fed
Puppet winds and puppet waves
Puppet sailors in their graves
Puppet flower, puppet stem
Puppet time dismantles them
Puppet me and puppet you
Puppet German
Puppet Jew

Puppet Presidents command
Puppet troops to burn the land
Puppet fire, puppet flames
Feed on all the puppet names
Puppet lovers in their bliss
Turn away from all of this
Puppet reader shakes his head
Takes his puppet wife to bed
Puppet me and puppet you
Puppet German, puppet Jew

Puppet Presidents command
Puppet troops to burn the land
Puppet fire, puppet flames
Feed on all the puppet names
Puppet night comes down to play
The after act to puppet day

"The Hills"

I can't make the hills
The system is shot
I'm living on pills
For which I thank God

My animal howls
My angel's upset
But I'm not allowed
A trace of regret

For someone will use
The thing I could not be
My heart will be hers
Impersonally

She'll step on the path
She'll see what I mean
My will cut in half
And freedom between

For this in a second
Our lives will collide
The endless suspended
The door opened wide

And she will be born
To someone like you
What I left undone
She will certainly do

I know she is coming
And I know she will look
And that is the longing
And this is the hook

I can't make the hills
The system is shot
I'm living on pills
For which I thank God

My page was too white
My ink was too thinned
The day wouldn't write
But the night penciled in

But I know she's coming
And I know she will look
That is the longing
This is the hook

I know she is coming
And I know she will look
That is the longing
And this is the hook

I can't make the hills
The system is shot
I'm living on pills
For which I thank God

I sailed like a swan
I sank like a rock
But time is long gone
Past my laughing stock

I can't make the hills
The system is shot
I'm living on pills
For which I thank God

"Listen To The Hummingbird"

Listen to the hummingbird
Whose wings you cannot see
Listen to the hummingbird
Don't listen to me

Listen to the butterfly
Whose days but number three
Listen to the butterfly
Don't listen to me

Listen to the mind of God
Which doesn't need to be
Listen to the mind of God
Don't listen to me

Listen to the hummingbird
Whose wings you cannot see
Listen to the hummingbird
Don't listen to me

"Feels So Good"

Feels so good, not to love you like I did
Feels so good, not to love you like I did
It's like they tore away my blindfold and they said, we're gonna let this prisoner live
It's like they tore away my blindfold and they said, we're gonna let this prisoner live

Feels so good to wake up in the morning by myself
Cup of coffee in the kitchen, fire up a little danger to my health
Ah, they're selling freedom everywhere, it's flying off the shelf
Yeah, they're selling freedom everywhere but love, that's something else

Ah you drift into my dreams as if you had the right
And you show me how you broke me doing all the little things I really like
But I let it all go by just so long as you and I don't have to fight
Yeah, I let it all go by just so long as you and I don't have to fight

Well I don't know about tomorrow but I know what's coming next
I've used up all my questions; I have no answers left
In a while I won't remember what I promised you I never would forget
In a while I won't remember what I promised you I never would forget

Feels so good not to wonder who you'll get
Who you love, who you touch and who you kiss
Oh baby, who'd ever guess that there's a side of loneliness as sweet as this
Would you ever guess that there's a side of loneliness as sweet as this

Feels so good not to love you like I did
Feels so good not to love you like I did
It's like they tore away my blindfold and they said, we're gonna let this prisoner live
It's like they tore away my blindfold and they said, we're gonna let this prisoner live

"Necropsy Of Love"

If it came about you died
It might be said I loved you:
Love is an absolute as death is
And neither bears false witness to the other
But you remain alive

No, I do not love you
Hate the word
That private tyranny inside a public sound
Your freedom's yours and not my own:
But hold my separate madness like a sword
And plunge it in your body all night long

If death shall strip our bones of all but bones
Then here's the flesh and flesh that's drunken-sweet
As wine cups in deceptive lunar light:
Reach up your hand and turn the moonlight off
And maybe it was never there at all
So never promise anything to me:
But reach across the darkness with your hand
Reach across the distance of tonight
And touch the moving moment once again
Before you fall asleep

"Never Gave Nobody Trouble"

Couldn't pay the mortgage
And it broke my baby's heart
I couldn't pay the mortgage
It broke my baby's heart
I never gave nobody trouble
But it ain't too late to start

Don't wanna break no window
Don't wanna burn no car
Don't wanna break no window
And I don't wanna burn your car
You got the right to all your riches
But you let it go too far

You sail the mighty ocean
On a yacht designed for you
You sail the mighty ocean
On a yacht designed for you
Yeah, but the ocean's thick with garbage
You ain't gonna make it through

[Solo]

I never gave nobody trouble
I'm a law and order man
I never gave nobody trouble
I'm a law and order man
I said, I never gave nobody trouble
But you know god damn well that I can

"Recitation"

You came to me this morning and you handled me like meat.
Youâd have to be a man to know how good that feels, how sweet.
My mirrored twin, my next of kin, Iâd know you in my sleep and who but you would take me in, a thousand kisses deep.

I loved you when you opened like a lily to the heat, you see Iâm just another snowman standing in the rain and sleet, who loved you with his frozen love, his second hand physique, with all he is, and all he was,
A thousand kisses deep.

I know you had to lie to me, I know you had to cheat, to pose all hot and high behind the veils of shear deceit, our perfect porn aristocrat so elegant and cheap, Iâm old but Iâm still into that,
A thousand kisses deep.

Iâm good at love, Iâm good at hate, it' s in between I freeze.
Been working out, but its too late, itâs been to late for years.
But you look good, you really do, they love you on the street.
If you were here Iâd kneel for you,
a thousand kisses deep.

The autumn moved across your skin, got something in my eye, a light that doesnât need to live, and doesnât need to die.
A riddle in the book of love, obscure and obsolete, till witnessed here in time and blood,
A thousand kisses deep.

And I'm still working with the wine, still dancing cheek to cheek, the band is playing Auld Lang Syne, but the heart will not retreat.
I ran with Diz and I sang with Ray, I never had their sweep, but once or twice they let me play
A thousand kisses deep.

I loved you when you opened like a lily to the heat, you see, I'm just another snowman standing in the rain and sleet, who loved you with his frozen love, his second hand physique, with all he is, and all he was,
A thousand kisses deep.

But you donât need to hear me now, and every word I speak, it counts against me anyhow,
A thousand kisses deep.
