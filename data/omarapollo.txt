"Stereo (Intro)"

I need, I need you
I want, I want you

Three days my eye's turning blue
My head, my mind, it turns to you
Ella, ella me dijo
Tome este vino
Baila tanto, baila tan bien
Ella, ella me dijo
Tome este vino
Baila tanto, baila tan bien

I need, I need you
I want, I want you

Drank too much
I really hate myself
Two cars race down the hill
Swerve quick, loose steering wheel
Turn it off
My shit don't work at all
I'm close to help my fall
But please don't take away my soul
Soul
Soul

I need, I need you
I want, I want you

"Ignorin"

Love beating, it's coming, it might please you
Glove fitted, I'm walking with ease
Wasn't a compliment, was it too obvious?
That I need you, I need you

I don't think you dumb, you kinda hot
It's a lovely morning
Fuck, I love your colour, it's so fun
Oh, is that your colour?
Damn, they think I'm cool

What's your, uh, what's your, uh, what's your uh uh

I hear you callin'
I'm just ignorin' probably
Don't got your number
I ain't that caring baby

So addicted, wishing that you were mine
Then might have to lie, I do that all the time
I'm out here wishing, wishing for other guys
That I don't really like, what a waste of time

I don't think you dumb, you kinda hot
It's a lovely morning
Fuck, I love your colour, it's so fun
Oh, is that your colour?
Damn, they think I'm cool

No need today

I'm just ignorin' probably
Don't got your number
I ain't the caring baby

"Erase"

I don't mind, my head's in the sky
Thinkin' of you, oh, feelin' for you, oh oh
It's cold right now, I miss you for life
It's not going away, I thought I'd be okay, yeah

I still think about the time
The time I spent just tryna grow with you
Baby, I was out of line
But you weren't there, you weren't there

And oh baby, and oh baby, I'm trying
I can't erase your picture from my head
Oh, maybe you took over my mind (you're fine)
I can't erase your picture from my head

I wish you weren't feeling so sad
I feel what you do, oh, I got that from you, oh oh
I shouldn't be so bothered by you
I'd probably be okay, if you just went away, yeah

I still think about the time
The time I spent just tryna grow with you
Baby, I was out of line
But you weren't there, you weren't there

Oh baby, and oh baby, I'm trying

Oh, maybe you took over my mind (you're fine)

What you, what you gon' feel me lately
I feel like I'm going out my way for you

Oh baby, and oh baby, I'm trying
I can't erase your picture from my head
Oh, maybe you took over my mind (you're fine)
I can't erase your picture from my head

"Ugotme"

'Cause baby there's something you know
But clearly you say, I'm not good for you
I think that I'm barely in love
You said you don't smoke, you do
Here's something I wrote for you
One time I had love for you

'Cause honestly, you got me gone
From everyone

Times you take my breath away
I'm so in love with you
Now just passing the time
Waiting longer for you
Oh baby ooh oooooh
And baby you know, that I
Never put it on, it was you, you

'Cause honestly, you got me gone
From everyone

"Hijo De Su Madre"

You a hoe when it comes to real life
Hot tub, what that coffee feel like?
Nice rug I ain't talking real pipe
Cyclops on the twelve, come near, I, I
Dress up when I hang with rich kids
I guess I'm hanging with rich kids, hey
I just thought of some new shit, yeah
And we still watching bootleg

Say you wanna make a scene?
Oh you wanna rock the beat?
Say you wanna make a scene?
Oh you wanna rock the beat?

You ain't ever seen a brown boy like this
I shoulda seen your lips through your eyelids

Now my whip hella stuck with no pilot
Indiana kinda hot for my biceps
I ain't really got no biceps
Why you always concerned who I kiss?
Yeah, I just wanna call for a ride in

My baby's calling me
I'm picking up like "hey babe"
Asking where I'm at
I just say "OK" [x2]

Say you wanna make a scene?
Oh you wanna rock the beat?
Say you wanna make a scene?
Oh you wanna rock the beat?

You should call the cops when you give me a lift

Say you wanna make a scene?
Oh you wanna rock the beat?
Say you wanna make a scene?
Oh you wanna rock the beat?

"Lucky"

I'm not upset but don't carve my feels out
I'll lose you like a dime
Blue chest and blue face and blue head
I'm not pretending

You're lost again, you waste your time, I think I'll start all over
Don't wait to comfort me, I think I lose so don't pull over
You wish you had me blind and turned my mind you didn't help me
I changed for you but you don't really want me, I feel lucky

I feel lucky
Oh, I feel lucky
I feel lucky
Oh, I feel lucky

And as she hurts my head I wish you were alone
I'm mad if I'm your fool, I'll lose you in the morn'
It feels like you really want it all
It feels like you really want it all

You're lost again, you waste your time, I think I'll start all over
Don't wait to comfort me, I think I'll lose so don't pull over

And I'm fine

Got into some bad love

I know I thought that we could be friends
But now I'm caught up in this mess
I can't pretend that I don't feel this
'Cause if I don't it'll leave me depressed

And I know it don't make no sense
But I'm getting used to this
And I'm older now but I'm still young
And I got many, oh many years to come

You just thought I just wanted to be friends

"Hearing Your Voice"

Met a shaman, he was crazy
Called me stupid, stole my money
Told him 'bout what we've been facing
I've been jealous, often dating
Know you stole my fuckin' phone
Probably read something real crazy
Heard you changed your name in lovers
Wish that I could call you baby

But that's not fair
You got everything I need
Used to call me constantly
You cut your hair
Change it all except for me
Don't take back what's meant to be

It don't make sense to me
But I'm fantasizing 'bout hearing your voice
It don't make sense to me
But I'm fantasizing 'bout hearing your voice

Wish you lived a little closer
Clean your house, borrow some clothes
Maybe talk 'bout California
Heard it's not like Indiana
I got time, what you expected?
Sleepless nights, felt disconnected
Smoke a lot, your dad don't care
He's on the porch catching some air

But that's not fair
You got everything I need
Used to call me constantly
You cut your hair
Change it all except for me
Don't take back what's meant to be

It don't make sense to me
But I'm fantasizing 'bout hearing your voice
It don't make sense to me
But I'm fantasizing 'bout hearing your voice

Don't close your eyes again
Cause you're not there
I'm not confiding in
What's really here
What's really here

It don't make sense to me
But I'm fantasizing 'bout hearing your voice
It don't make sense to me
But I'm fantasizing 'bout hearing your voice

"So Good"

Know you got a thing to do instead
But it's running away (Away)
Hold you to my heart and to my chest
Got me hurting my brain (My brain)

Say it's obvious that I don't need your lovin', babe
(Baby, what'd you say?)
Why would I? Baby, what'd you say?
It's wrong and I need you, oh I

And I want you all
For a minute
When did you turn so sensitive?
And I want you all
Baby, please
Why would you go and turn it down?
Yeah, everything you want
Is everything I need
So why you walk away?
This love is like a dream
But baby, turn around
You had me from the start
I'm losing all control
So go and break my heart

So good
So good

Took a couple months to get upset
Been avoiding the pain (The pain)
Maybe I should go and catch my breath
I've been tryna explain (Explain)

Say it's obvious that I don't need your lovin', babe

Why would I? Baby, what'd you say?

"I'm Amazing"

I'm amazing, that's what they tell me
I don't think of that too much, it overwhelm me
I don't think you love me 'cause you don't reach out
Yeah, you broke my fuckin' heart, took a piece out
Since I was eighteen, I've had my mask off
And I wish you could've seen how much I slacked off
You my baby, you make me inhale
Yeah, these bitches always fillin' up my email
Why you tryna play me? Don't get no detail (Tryna play me)
I'ma hit it from the back and then we reset
And I ain't called you, that's on me, bruh (That's on me)
I've been on the road too much and I ain't seen ya

Don't make me wish I didn't
Don't make me wish I didn't (We still fuck on the side)
Don't make me wish I didn't (And it's just you and I)
Don't make me wish I didn't

Aqui me quedo, me voy temprano
Y que voy a estar tarde, soy Mexicano
When I needed money that I could borrow
Pick you up, then have a show up in Chicago
I'm makin' M's now, listenin' to Stevie
And the whip got autopilot when I'm sleepy
We in the city, you like bikinis
Know I shoulda said somethin', I know, believe me
Moved away, but you got a girl now
Shit remind me when I used to blow your back out
You fuckin' hate me, on different paths now
Yeah, I used to drink so much, but now I tap out

Don't make me wish I didn't
Don't make me wish I didn't (We still fuck on the side)

"Kamikaze"

Stay back, stay back, stay back, stay back, stay back, stay back
For what? For what? For what? For what? For what? For what?

Got someone to cover me, I work the late shift
Drive through Georgia, nineteen hours on a vacation
I ain't never left the state, man, I've been waitin'
And that pretty boy still hit me up on strange occasions (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

But we was kids and we was younger (Was younger)
I stop to wonder (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm naive, but I remember
Rain drop December (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I've been wondering if you'd call me (If you'd call me)
Move like tsunamis (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Now we're strangers in this lobby (In this lobby)
Like kamikaze (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

I ain't really know you was freaky though
Ass round like Cheerios
And you got a lil' Vimeo
What's the password? You just froze

Say you gotta go, vÃ¡monos
And I told you just leave me alone (Leave me alone)
Yeah, I told you just leave me alone, yeah

Yeah, it really don't feel good, does it? Pop shuv it
You don't ever say, "My bad," you nothing, you nothing
Told me that I wasn't worth shit, you buggin', you buggin'
If you wasn't so selfish, you love it, you love it

I'm still driving all alone, it's automatic
My eyes are tired, I'm drivin' slow, no sign of traffic
I pull over, go to sleep, listen to classics (Hmm, hmm, hmm)
Think of you, and you and me, 'cause I'm an addict (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

But we was kids and we was younger
I stop to wonder (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm naive, but I remember
Rain drop December (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Move like tsunamis (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Now we're strangers in this lobby

Fuck you, boy

Yeah, it really don't feel good, does it? Pop shuv it
You don't ever say my bad, you nothing, you nothing
Told me that I wasn't worth shit, you buggin', you buggin'
If you wasn't so selfish, you love it, you love it

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo

I think you'd want me to know it's like ivory

"Talk"

Bite your tongue, bite your tongue on purpose
Said you really need to see me in person
"I'm on my way!" yeah, you make it sound urgent
When I see you feel like I be done searching
Serious, seriously broken
Yeah, I really need to see you, not joking
But I really need some time to be open

I really like you in the morning
This feeling's got me talking
Too much
And I'll be here till Sunday
I'll see you again someday

Ay, ay

When I'm in the street, look good, take a picture
Take a picture, take a picture, take a picture

Pay me up to separate us if you feelin' lucky
Bottle up my feelings so much, one day you won't love me
One day you might love me

"No Good Reason"

I heard you talk about me boy how come you don't admit it

You act like if you said it that I'd hate you but I'm with it

"Invincible"
(feat. Daniel Caesar)

If I were to go (Go, go)
Tell me, would you notice me?
If I were to go (Go, go)
Tell me, would you notice me?
(If I were to)

Twenty-four hours after CS:01 release
I miss my girl, it's time to hit the streets
I went to check my doc, get some vitamin C
You won't believe what happened to me, I

Drip, drip, drip with the cold IV
Out of consciousness if I ever slip it
And I woke up in an ambulance

If I were to go (Go, go)
Tell me, would you notice me?
If I were to go (Go, go)
Tell me, would you notice me?
(If I were to)

Sixty-four hours since my baby spoke to me
He kissed me, now I love his dopamine
I tried to go to sleep but my brain on 2C-B
You won't believe what happened to me, I
Drip, drip, drip with the cold IV
Out of consciousness if I ever slip it
I been gone, moving high speed now
That's my song, let me hear that bounce
Latin boy, Frida Khalo brow
Jacquemus jeans, Ferragamo brown
Venetian walls with porcelain tile
286, Donnie Darko town
If I'm down, would you help me out?
If I'm down, would you help me out?

I had to call you back to tell you that (Call me back)
You could have spared my feelings (Could have spared my feelings)
I'm not invincible, I'm not invincible (I'm not invincible)
I had to call you back to tell you that (Call me back)
You could have spared my feelings (Could have spared)
I'm not invincible
I'm not invincible (I'm not invincible)

If I were to go tell me would you notice me
If I were to go tell me would you notice me
If I were to go tell me would you notice me

"Endlessly Interlude"

Yourself to me, baby (Baby)
Already got what I'll ever need (Ever need)
I know deep in me there's everything (Everything)
What if I trust myself endlessly? (Endlessly)

Oh, la, la, la, la, la
Oh, la, la, la, la, la
Oh, la, la, la, la, la
Oh, la, la, la, la, la

"Killing Me"

You-ooh, ooh-ooh
You-ooh, ooh-ooh

Why, do I depend on you?
Sixteen, about to pull up
Think 'bout your body too much
I'm, feelin' you for real
Missin' the party for what?
There ain't nobody but us

Love me like I'm gonna die
Fuck me like you fantasize
Touch me like you know you provide to
They wanna lie too
Just wanna slide through, oh

What I do makes me wonder if I'm alright
Holding back feelings like it's the end of my life
That's right, shit killing me
That's right, shit killing me

QuÃ© locura solo piense a ti
Cuando me tocas y me llamas, oh Lord
Adrenaline, gentleman right there
Skeletons that I don't hold back
Try to stop, do you feel relaxed?
Love you but you make feel light-headed, oh, oh

Love me like I'm gonna die
Fuck me like you fantasize
Touch me like you know you provide to
They wanna lie too
Just wanna slide through, oh

What I do makes me wonder if I'm alright
Holding back feelings like it's the end of my life
That's right, shit killing me (That's, right, that's right, that's right, that's, right, that's right, that's right)
That's right, shit killing me (That's, right, that's right, that's right, that's, right, that's right, that's right)

That's, right, that's right, that's right
That's, right, that's right, that's right (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
That's, right, that's right, that's right (Ooh, ooh-woah)
That's, right, that's right, that's right (Oh, why I kissed you?)

"Go Away"

You can take the throne
Body glows like gold
Beating hearts lie close
Without you, time moves slow

Do you think that I could stay?
'Cause if I leave, then I complain
I know this feeling's not a crime
You said you feel it all the time

But if you had to go away again
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough
It's something in the way I feel your skin
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough

If you saw me every morning
Would you feel less important?
Is that too much I'm forcing?
'Cause I don't wanna be much
I love the way that we touch
Do you like all of my friends, and
I want your attention
Before you'd never mention
That you got time here to stay
Is that too much for your brain?

But if you had to go away again
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough
It's something in the way I feel your skin
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough

But if you had to go away again
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough

But if you had to go away again
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough
It's something in the way I feel your skin
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough

"Waiting On You"

Handsome and tall, my baby
They think he gets all the ladies
If you were there then you would know
Don't even care nobody
Invites him to all the parties
If he cared then he would go

Pace 'round, sitting down wishing for a sign that
Don't come, I'll stay here as long as I'm alive
I'm waiting on you
I'm waiting on you

Buff and his skin looks gorgeous
How could someone ignore this?
We took a trip down a new road
After his pupils widened
It got him realizing
That he wouldn't dream to be alone

Pace 'round, sitting down wishing for a sign that
Don't come, I'll stay here as long as I'm alive
I'm waiting on you
I'm waiting on you

Pace 'round, sitting down wishing for a sign that
Don't come, I'll stay here as long as I'm alive
I'm waiting on you
I'm waiting on you

"Petrified"

The bedspread was silk
But the marbles were stiff
He showed me my face
So I loosened my grip
A shadow came down
Told me I live, a lie

Thinking of you more each day
I'm thinking about all the words you say to me

A stranger convinced me to cancel my trip
He sang me a song but it didn't exist
He said an angel came down and gave him a melody

Thinking of you more each day
I'm thinking about all the words you say to me

I believe in making up
I believe in making up
I believe in what I fear
Lately I've been able to see more clear

Thinking of you more each day
I'm thinking bout all the words you say to me

"Personally"

'Cause I really don't wanna be here alone
Too many people I don't see no more
Too many feelings I don't feel no more
'Cause I really don't wanna be here alone
Too many people I don't need no more
So many doubts that I stop keeping score

Remember when you told me
That I ain't lonely you used to hold me
You always was the one to make up reasons quick
And I would be the one that would believe in it
Facetime me just to pass time
But I still rewind what you said last night
You said that you would always have some reasoning
How come you only did that on the weekend, then?

Don't take this personally
I just can't be the person you need
What we got ain't working for me
And all it ever did was change the person in me

Don't take this personally
I just can't be the person you need
What we got ain't working for me
All it ever did was change the person in me

'Cause I really don't wanna be here alone
Too many people I don't see no more
Too many feelings I don't feel no more
'Cause I really don't wanna be here alone
Too many people I don't need no more
So many doubts that I stop keeping score

Can't sleep 'cause I been stressed out
My eyes they caved in, I scarred my eyebrow
Too much that's on my mind, I gotta deal with shit
It'll slow me down if I don't come to peace with it
Relax, you told me relax
But I can't focus if I don't fight back
When you said I love you, you was joking then
Ain't seen you in years but we ain't spoken since

Don't take this personally
I just can't be the person you need
What we got ain't working for me
And all it ever did was change the person in me

Don't take this personally
I just can't be the person you need
What we got ain't working for me
All it ever did was change the person in me

'Cause I really don't wanna be here alone
Too many people I don't see no more
Too many feelings I don't feel no more
'Cause I really don't wanna be here alone
Too many people I don't need no more
So many doubts that I stop keeping score

"En El Olvido"

JamÃ¡s tuve esperanza
Me pegÃ³ la bala
Sin tu calor
Me acuerdo de antes
Tiene otras amantes
Me da dolor

TÃº no sabes tanto que yo harÃ­a
Tocarte las manitas debajo del cielo
Algo importante
Quiero mostrarte
QuizÃ¡s no tengo el valor

Arrancaste todo que quedaba
Por razones que no aceptaba
CariÃ±o, yo fui buen amante
En el olvido quiero dejarte

Renuncias lo que daba
Amor siempre se acaba, aunque tÃº no lo crees
Amor equivocada, aunque es lo que soÃ±aba
Te pido perdÃ³n

TÃº no sabes tanto que yo harÃ­a
Tocarte las manitas debajo del cielo
Algo importante
Quiero mostrarte
QuizÃ¡s no tengo el valor

Arrancaste todo que quedaba
Por razones que no aceptaba

En el olvido quiero dejarte

"Can't Get Over You"

Can't get over you
Can't get over you
Your skin feels like a planet
When I kiss you I could just die
Stay until the morning 'cause you know you been on my mind

"Evergreen (You Didn't Deserve Me At All)"

He don't love
Me no more
He don't love
He don't love

Evergreen, he controls me
Was there something wrong with my body?
Am I not what you wanted, babe?
If I ever tried, if I ever tried

Evergreen, he tears me to pieces
(Evergreen) Doesn't even have to try

She could never love you more
More than me
But sometimes I pray that you fall in love
I've cried, I've cried so much
For you, baby

Evergreen, he tears me to pieces
(Evergreen) Doesn't even have to try
(Evergreen)

You know you really made me hate myself
Had to stop before I break myself
Shoulda broke it off to date myself
You didn't deserve me at all
At all, at all

Please don't come home to me
Sweet Evergreen
He don't love

"Archetype"

There's a lot of boys in California
They don't get along like you and I
So pretty that you kill me softly
If you were to leave, if I were to die
You know I really want to risk it all
Kiss my collarbone, found my archetype

If you need me, I'll be right there waitin'
Hold me till I break thin, don't want this to end
(Don't want this to end)
Could you help me, help you think about me
I think of you daily, I could give you all
(I can give you all)

You're the only one that holds me
You're the only one that holds me

Yea, I know you're feeling paranoia
Are you in love? Cause I wanna try
I can tell just by the way that you're talking to me
You don't have a clue, neither do I
I didn't really think you cared at all
What you said on the phone left me petrified

If you need me, I'll be right there waitin'
Hold me till I break thin, don't want this to end
(Don't want this to end)
Could you help me, help you think about me

"Saving All My Love"

Aggressive how he God, yeah, you turning both ways
Don't you lie to yourself, boy, that's a cold place
See it on your whole face
Don't get attached to your body, it change with old age
I know you feel that cocaine
I see the lies through your nose
Prince VoilÃ , I left my body exposed, you left with nada
I'm feeling brava
Sweat drip down my eyes, yeah, but he got that Prada
And the sun don't shine and my headphones died and the tide is low
Watch the wings collapse and you free fall down, that's a dirty road
Turn around, turn around, turn around, everything's in front of you
Happiness can stay a while
But sometimes it don't come alright, no
So I wait, why wait?
Do you chase? Not patient
So I saved all my love for you

"Pretty Boy"

Pretty boy
Pretty like the ocean and the sky at night
And I fell in you
Right after we made love on a starry night
And the wind crept in through our window
I can feel it on my skin
You're so pretty boy (Pretty boy)
I think of you so much, I couldn't love you more (I couldn't love you more)
I just dream of you (Dream of you)
When you're not around I picture you next to me (Next to me)
And it hurts to think that someone else might love you like I do

Just know that I'm missing you
Stole my heart and made me run
You're so beautiful (Your skin so smooth)
You stole my heart and made me run to you
Baby, it's us

You're my favorite boy
Nobody's ever felt the things you feel from me
And if I let you go (Let you go)
Don't think that I could ever really be at peace (Ever be at peace)
'Cause the way you talk makes me undress
Think of times we can't relive

Just know that I'm missing you
Stole my heart and made me run
You're so beautiful (Your skin so smooth)
You stole my heart and made me run to you
Baby, it's us

"Ice Slippin"

When you comin' home?
Home is where you supposed to be
Turn around, it's not too late, did I hurt you?
You live too far away
Are you turnin' off your phone again?
If I take back my words, would you return to me?

Drive around in the snow, ice on the glass
Heat didn't work, couldn't see nothing (Ooh, ooh)
Ice slippin', swear to God, I could've hit the brakes, still on lock, almost said "Fuck it" (Fuck, fuck, fuck it)
And I hate being too much, could've just sighed to me that night, could've just said nothin'
I wish we would've just said nothin', nothin' (Nothin')

And you thought what you said would be for the best
But instead it broke me down

When you comin' home?
Home is where you supposed to be
Turn around, it's not too late, did I hurt you?
You live too far away
Are you turnin' off your phone again?
If I take back my words, would you return to me?

Water drops, cracked phone, couldn't even type, left you on read, know it did damage
Bloodstains on your fists, used to only fight when you was around no cameras
We used to be so young, didn't even act right, we didn't have no manners
We really didn't have no manners

If I'm bein' honest
If I said what I said, would you hate me?
Would you hate me?

When you comin' home?
Home is where you supposed to be
Turn around, it's not too late, did I hurt you?
You live too far away
Are you turnin' off your phone again?
If I take back my words, would you return to me?

Been about it, fucking on me
Been about it, fucking on me
Me

Real life, real life, real life
Yeah, you ain't got no real friends in your life, your life, your life
You gon' feel better by the springtime (Springtime)
You gon' feel better by the springtime
Slippin' on ice in the meantime

When you comin' home?
Home is where you supposed to be
Turn around, it's not too late, did I hurt you?
You live too far away
Are you turnin' off your phone again?
If I take back my words, would you return to me?

And you thought what you said would be for the best
Instead it broke me down
Never thought that I'd leave
But I still believe I can make you proud

"Live For Me"

You told me
You won't live too long
And I wish I
Could say something to change

How you feel about the way your life is goin'?
And tell me why you'd wanna go through it alone, hey

Won't you live for me?
Or could I live for you?
There's nothing I won't carry
So you don't have to

Woah, woah, woah (Ooh)

Won't you live for me? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Or could I live for you? (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
There's nothing I won't carry (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
So you don't have to (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

"Angel"

Touch you nose, curve your spine
Broken smile, his blurry eyes
Don't walk among the demonized
To fair and over, to melt his mind
Numb and starved (Numb and starved), sacrifice (Will you sacrifice?)
You pray to God (You pray to God), I'll pray to mine (I'll pray to mine)

Too young to grow wings, too young to be an angel
Your mother needs you, woah
Your father needs you
Too young to grow wings, too young to be an angel
Your mother needs you, woah
Your father needs you, oh

What I want, see you tomorrow
Want to, I lie
Break my arm (My arm), I broke my arm
Broke boy farms, call my mom
She picked me up, pray to God (Pray to God)
She told me, "Pray to God"
Pray to God, what I want
To go get high
Call my paps, call my dad (Call my dad)
Tell him I love him, I lied
Used to roll, roll my eyes (Ooh)
Now I wish you'd call me more, I should try
I should try

Too young to grow wings, too young to be an angel
Your mother needs you, woah
Your father needs you
Too young to grow wings, too young to be an angel
Your mother needs you, woah
Your father needs you, oh

I don't know what I said to you but I lied
Remember when I told I was good but I lied?
I don't know what I said to you but I lied
Remember when I told I was good but I lied?

Too young to grow wings, too young to be an angel
Your mother needs you, woah
Your father needs you
Too young to grow wings, too young to be an angel
Your mother needs you, woah
Your father needs you, oh
Too young to grow wings, too young to be an angel
Your mother needs you, woah
Your father needs you
Too young to grow wings, too young to be an angel
Your mother needs you, woah
Your father needs you

"Pilot"

She leaves, she got it better than me
Ooh, so much better than me
Can I lie when you're better than me? (Better, better than me)
No

Let me know what you think, I'm outside, you know I been waitin' by the doorman (West, West Side)
You know I would've stayed in LA, makin' more bread if I knew you wasn't really tryna romance
Diamonds blindin' my eyes, wear all white on my chest like it's snowman
Ride the bike with no hands, like a pole dance

So dark that I wish you sun
So sad that I wish you love
I gave you a rose
Down by the coast

Sufferin' for you is growin' on me
And you know I still got you
By any means
Yeah, I got you
I got you still
Yeah, I got you still (Still, still)
I got you, still (I got you, still)

The club got me up
I miss you, I miss you

Jesus in my eyes, gonna fly it like a pilot
And my eyes move side to side like a light in my eyelids, and I
Checked by the hotel room, water drops in my forehead
Raindrops got my clothes wet
Got a drink and I poured that
Vacay ruined, where are my hoes?
I been lookin' (Child), I don't know
Drivin' home drunk, on a buzz on my birthday
Eyes on God and my boss like a curly
Drivin' home drunk, on a buzz on my birthday
Eyes on God and my boss like a curly

Sufferin' for you is growin' on me (Take, take, take)
And you know I still got you
By any means
Yeah, I got you
I got you, still (Still, still, still)
Sufferin' for you is growin' to me
And you know I still got you
By any means
Yeah, I got you
I got you, still
Yeah, I got you still
I got you, still

These ain't what they seen
These ain't what they seem
I know it's not fair
Oh, to last forever
Wanna hurt you forever
Tryna last forever (Woah)
It doesn't hurt forever
Forever

"3 Boys"

I don't wanna see any of your friends
I don't
I know it's hard for you to be alone
But that's where we're different
I'd be emotionless all the way if I could
I should take your advice and find someone new
So I could have two

I don't want to
Fell asleep with your hand on my skull
And my face in your lap
At the Bowery Hotel, missing you
How did I fall so fast?
Seems like everything I do take me further from you

Three boys would work if I wasn't so tethered to you (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
What should I do? (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I can't even choose (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm tethered to you, hey (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

You pray to God that it would leave (It won't leave)
All that you feel for me (All that you feel)
It won't be light, it won't feel right
My hand around your neck that you're tortured by
Spend a lot of time with you, I can't let go
I know there's some things you can't speak
But thoughts of a third make me weak, weak

I don't want to
Fell asleep with your hand on my skull
And my face in your lap
At the Bowery Hotel, missin' you
How did I fall so fast?
Seems like everything I do take me further from you

Three boys would work if I wasn't so tethered to you (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
What should I do? (What should I do?)
I can't even choose (I can't even choose)
I'm tethered to you, hey (I'm tethered to you)

To you

"Algo"
(feat. Drayco McCoy)

I'm not so perfect, but I really try
That's enough affection coming for my life
Talk about it when it comes to users
I don't really like to chill with losers
I be running all the time

Â¿Por quÃ© me amas tÃº?
Â¿Por quÃ© me amas?
Yo no tengo la opciÃ³n de volver pa' atrÃ¡s
Yo no sabia que estabas conmigo
Nunca lo dijo, nunca lo dijo

Something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Oh, something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Something's on my mind

Ooh baby, let me touch you right here
Yeah, you're perfect, you know I'm worthless
Shouldn't deserve this
But you're right here
You twerkin
Girl, your body language moving in cursive
Mami I know you probably just like me 'cause you don't know me
Shorty I know molly hit highly, I'm also rolling
When the moonlight shines, and the hearts get stolen
Let's fucking get high 'til the morning
Come on here

I'm not so perfect, but I really try
That's enough affection coming for my life
Talk about it when it comes to users
I don't really like to chill with losers
I be running all the time

Â¿Por quÃ© me amas tÃº?
Â¿Por quÃ© me amas?
Yo no tengo la opciÃ³n de volver pa' atrÃ¡s
Yo no sabia que estabas conmigo
Nunca lo dijo, nunca lo dijo

Something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Oh, something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Something's on my mind
Something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Oh, something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Something's on my mind (and it's not you)

"Beauty Boy"

I don't know
Stone's too cold
You're always on my mind
I'm smoking though
I'm hoping so
You always hit my line

I need my job
To see my beauty boy
And if you leave
Oh it's not my choice

I want to say I love him
I want to say I love him

You take all my love
I'm afraid I can't love no one again (one again)
You're all I want
(Oooh)

See, boy I love it when you come
I don't care for me
I don't know how to waste my time
Because he's seventeen
You came again
I don't know you love me for it
You came again
Don't try to say "no more"

I want to say I love him
I want to say I love him

You take all my love
I'm afraid I can't love no one again
You're all I want
(Oooh)

"Brakelights"

My car is a little like you
It's not working right now
Say that we're lovers
And we miss our mothers again
She don't really like you
Boy I kind of like you
You don't really like to mention that to me
Tell em write a haiku cuz
No one really likes me
I'm getting used to that

Days by, baby I don't got no brake lights
My car turns off when I go fast
Why would you want me
Days by, baby I don't got no brake lights
My car turns off when I go fast
Why would you want me

Days by, I'm losing the sunrise
I'll fall close to you
Losing my mind

"FrÃ­o"

No puedo amarte
De vuelta
Me besas
Con fuerza
Ay no me sueltes
AcÃ¡bame
La tristeza

No puedo amarte
De vuelta
Me besas
Con fuerza
Ay no me sueltes
AcÃ¡bame

No puedo con este dolor, dolor
Y ya acabe contigo, contigo
Tu negaste tanto amor, amor
Me dejaste frÃ­o, frÃ­o

Y cada vez que te veo en la calle
Que me va todo bien y tÃº sabes
Te la paces llamando a mis padres
Que no vez que no somos iguales
Y cada vez que te veo en la calle
Que me va todo bien y tÃº sabes
Te la paces llamando a mis padres
Que no vez que no somos iguales

No puedo amarte
De vuelta
Me besas
Con fuerza
Ay no me sueltes

Strongly
Don't let me go
Finish with
My sadness

I can't take this pain, pain
And I'm already done with you, you
You denied so much love, love
You left me cold, cold

Every time I see you on the streets
And everything is going well and you know
You go and call my parents
Can't you see we're not the same
Every time I see you on the streets
And everything is going well and you know

"Hit Me Up"

Said, I've got some time I'm abusin'
Change my mind if you ever switch it up
And I won't waste my time if you pursue me
I'll let you know if you ever hit me up

Pretty boy, pretty boy
Not a city guy
I ain't intimate, I don't wanna fit
Fill you up, fill you up
Put your head down
By my headphones
I don't get it but
Pullin' up, pullin' up
In my car
All my friends
Coming down
Say you won't, say you won't
Ride with me, yeah

I've got some time, I'ma use it
Change my mind if you ever switch it up
And I won't waste my time if you pursue me
I'll let you know if you ever hit me up

You know I wouldn't tell you where to go
Nobody listens to the radio, baby
We're bending corners like we're running from the sun
The whip is turning different colors and you takin' on changes

Wish I could see you, come around and fill you up
Waited for you, baby, but you stood me up
Breaking what you gave me, wasn't good enough
What you gave me wasn't good enough

Wish I could see you come around
Like one more time
Faded like dumb it down
Over quick just like summer time
Baby, just double down
I bet you would fuck with me now

Said, I've got some time I'm abusin'
Change my mind if you ever switch it up
And I won't waste my time if you pursue me
I'll let you know if you ever hit me up

"Imagine U"

Sometimes you touch me on my face
I wish you could've never left me
You're picking up my phone, on 2%
But you're not too far from me

And sometimes when you're walking by
I'll tell you I want you, I'll call you, I'll call you
And sometimes when you're walking by
I'll tell you I want you, I'll call you

Imagine you
Imagine you
Say that you love me
Say that you love me
Imagine you

You never told me I was rushing
But my mind's changing every day
I'm glad that you could even trust me

And sometimes when you're walking by
I'll tell you I want you, I'll call you, I'll call you
And sometimes when you're walking by
I'll tell you I want you, I'll call you

Imagine you
Imagine you
Say that you love me
Say that you love me
Imagine you

I hate when you hang with him
I think we're better as friends

"Pram"

Baby I know
That sometimes I'm bad at the usual
I really miss talkin' on the phone at night
Well there's a storm tonight
And you can call me

I don't smoke as much as you but
I rewrote this verse for you
'Cause I just want you to notice me
I just want you to notice me
I just want you to notice me

"Stayback (Remix)"
(feat. Bootsy Collins)

I got a lot on my mind, especially you
I can't help that you been on my mind
And I'm thinking about you, all the time
Yeah, I can't help that you been on my mind
You know I see you around
See you around 'cause I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore, yeah
See you around 'cause I don't care anymore
But I'd just like to say, that uh
It's not that bad
You took all that I had to forget about you, baby
It's not that bad
You took all that I had to forget about you baby

Oh, but you know I still feel you
You know I been feeling you since way back
But I couldn't even make the words to say that, say that
If I could switch bodies you know I'd change that, change that
But you could never love me (But you could never love me)
So stay back, stay back

Well, uh, I just wanna lay with my baby, yeah
But this is how we do it
There really ain't nothing to it
But this is how we do it

Mucha, gucha, gucha

Girl, you shouldn't play with me
I can't help that you been on my mind
And whatever you say, I still miss you every day
I can't help that you been on my mind
Yeah, mind, mind, mind
Tell 'em what we talking 'bout Omar

"Today"
(feat. Teo Halm)

Too many days I've felt they were strange
No wonder I feel like it's never gonna change
I just walk by, I'm thinking 'bout another
You don't, you don't even wanna know that
Today is just another day
Make my bed, I'm on my way
Checked my texts now I'm feeling like I'm gonna die
I should've took a five degree
Took some time to brush my teeth
Watched a movie, now I'm feeling like I'm gonna cry
I left my peace in the sheets

I don't know why I'm still here
When I should be asleep
I wish I was asleep
I wish I was asleep

I ain't runnin' from my shit, I'm just stressed out
I ain't far from the light, doing my best now
I'm just really trine swerve in the traffic
Feel the best when I'm lying in the street crack
Pretty far from okay, doing pretty bad
I'm just check up out my car, where my keys at?
Pulling up and the key's in ignition
I just really think I need some attention

I should've took a five degree
Took some time to brush my teeth
Watched a movie, now I'm feeling like I wanna cry
I left my peace in the sheets

I don't know why I'm still here
When I should be asleep
I wish I was asleep
I wish I was asleep

"Unbothered"

I don't need what you need
I'm so unbothered by you
I used to think you're the only thing bright like the moon

I feel (oh)
I feel (oh)
I feel (oh)
I feel (oh)
I've been avoiding you, sorry if you feel alone
I'm doing fine

I don't need what you need
I'm so unbothered by you
