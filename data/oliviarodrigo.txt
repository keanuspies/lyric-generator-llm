"brutal"

I want it to be, like, messy

I'm so insecure, I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I if not exploited?
And I'm so sick of seventeen
Where's my fucking teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
"Enjoy your youth," I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious, and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more

All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here

(Yeah)

I feel like no one wants me
And I hate the way I'm perceived
I only have two real friends
And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
'Cause I love people I don't like
And I hate every song I write
And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart
And I can't even parallel park

All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here

(Yeah)
(Just havin' a really good time)

Got a broken ego, broken heart
(Yeah, it's brutal out here, yeah, it's brutal out here)
And God, I don't even know where to start

"traitor"

Brown guilty eyes and little white lies
Yeah, I played dumb but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

And ain't it funny
How you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?

And ain't it funny
How you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

You talked to her
When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter

It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still a traitor

Now you bring her around
Just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy

And I know if you were true
There's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

Ain't it funny
All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid?

Ain't it funny?
Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

You talked to her
When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter

It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still a traitor

God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
When she's sleeping in the bed we made
Don't you dare forget about the way

You betrayed me
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

You talked to her
When we were together
You gave me your word
But that didn't matter

It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still

You're still a traitor
Yeah, you're still a traitor

God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you

"drivers license"

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
Oh, and I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street

Red lights
Stop signs
I still see your face
In the white cars
Front yards
Can't drive past the places
We used to
Go to
'Cause I still fucking love you, babe

Sidewalks
We crossed
I still hear your voice
In the traffic
We're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue
Know we're through
But I still fucking love you, babe

I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever now I drive alone past your street

"1 step forward, 3 steps back"

Called you on the phone today
Just to ask you how you were
All I did was speak normally
Somehow I still struck a nerve

You got me fucked up in the head, boy
Never doubted myself so much
Like am I pretty? Am I fun, boy?
I hate that I gave you power over that kind of stuff

'Cause it's always one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me, boy? I don't understand
No, I don't understand

And maybe in some masochistic way
I kind of find it all exciting
Like which lover will I get today?
Will you walk me to the door or send me home cryin'?

It's one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me, boy? I don't understand

No, it's back and forth, did I say something wrong?
It's back and forth, going over everything I said
It's back and forth, did I do something wrong?
It's back and forth, maybe, this is all your fault instead

It's one step forward and three steps back
And I'd leave you, but the roller coaster's all I've ever had
Yeah, it's one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me, boy?
I don't understand
No, I don't understand

"deja vu"

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin' 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin' in harmony
I bet she's braggin'
To all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you

Do you get dÃ©jÃ  vu when she's with you?
Do you get dÃ©jÃ  vu? Ah, hmm
Do you get dÃ©jÃ  vu, huh?

Do you call her, almost say my name?
'Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
'Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (I love you)

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the song she's singing now when she's with you

Do you get dÃ©jÃ  vu when she's with you?
Do you get dÃ©jÃ  vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get dÃ©jÃ  vu?

Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel
A different girl now, but there's nothing new

I know you get dÃ©jÃ  vu
I know you get dÃ©jÃ  vu
I know you get dÃ©jÃ  vu

"good 4 u"

Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world

And good for you, I guess that you've been working on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really taking off
It's like we never even happened, baby
What the fuck is up with that?

And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you
Well, screw that and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily

"enough for you"

I wore make-up when we dated
'Cause I thought you'd like me more
If I looked like the other prom queens
I know that you loved before
Tried so hard to be everything that you like
Just for you to say you're not the compliment type

And I knew how you took your coffee
And your favourite songs by heart
I read all of your self-help books so you'd think that I was smart
Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me
I knew from the start this is exactly how you'd leave

You found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
Yeah all I ever wanted was to be enough for you

And maybe I'm just not as interesting as the girls you had before
But God, you couldn't have cared less about
Someone who loved you more
I'd say you broke my heart
But you broke much more than that
Now, I don't want your sympathy
I just want myself back before

You found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough

Don't you think I loved you too much
To be used and discarded?
Don't you think I loved you too much
To think I deserve nothing?
But don't tell me you're sorry, boy
Feel sorry for yourself
'Cause someday, I'll be everything to somebody else

And they'll think that I'm so exciting
And you'll be the one who's cryin'
Yeah, you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
You say I'm never satisfied
But that's not me, it's you

'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough
But I don't think anything could ever be enough
For you
Enough for you
No, nothing's enough for you

"happier"

We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine
You know I know you've moved on
Found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you

And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet
She's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?

Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know
I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy but don't be happier

And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me?

And now I'm picking her apart
Like cutting her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful
She looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know
I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better

I hope you're happy
I wish you all the best
Really
Say you love her, baby
Just not like you loved me
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy
But don't be happier

I hope you're happy
Just not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know
Can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy but don't be happier

"jealousy, jealousy"

I kinda wanna throw my phone across the room
'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true
With paper-white teeth and perfect bodies
Wish I didn't care

I know their beauty's not my lack
But it feels like that weight is on my back
And I can't let it go

Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself
I'd rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
My jealousy, jealousy started followin' me (He-he-he, he)
Started followin' me (He-he-he, he)

And I see everyone gettin' all the things I want
I'm happy for them, but then again, I'm not
Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos
I can't stand it
Oh God, I sound crazy

Their win is not my loss
I know it's true, but
I can't help gettin' caught up in it all

Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself
Rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
My jealousy, jealousy (Yeah)

All your friends are so cool, you go out every night
In your daddy's nice car, yeah, you're livin' the life
Got a pretty face, a pretty boyfriend, too
I wanna be you so bad and I don't even know you
All I see is what I should be
Happier, prettier, jealousy, jealousy
All I see is what I should be
I'm losin' it, all I get's jealousy, jealousy

Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
And I'm so sick of myself
Rather be, rather be (Oh, oh)
Anyone, anyone else (Anybody else)
Jealousy, jealousy
Oh, I'm so sick of myself
I'd rather be, rather be (Oh-oh-oh)
Anyone, anyone else
Jealousy, jealousy started followin' me

"favorite crime"

Know that I loved you so bad
I let you treat me like that
I was your willing accomplice, honey

And I watched as you fled the scene
Doe-eyed as you buried me
One heart broke, four hands bloody

The things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

You used me as an alibi
I crossed my heart as you crossed the line
And I defended you to all my friends

And now, every time a siren sounds
I wonder if you're around
'Cause you know that I'd do it all again

Oh, the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

It's bittersweet to think about the damage that we'd do
'Cause I was going down, but I was doing it with you
Yeah, everything we broke, and all the trouble that we made
But I say that I hate you with a smile on my face

Oh, look what we became

Oh, the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
Oh, the things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

Your favorite crime
Your favorite crime
'Cause baby, you were mine

"hope ur ok"

I knew a boy once, when I was small
A tow-head blond, with eyes of salt
He played the drum in the marching band
His parents cared more about the Bible
Than being good to their own child
He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad

And somehow, we fell out of touch
Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush
Don't know if I'll see you again someday
But if you're out there, I hope that you're OK

My middle school friend grew up alone
She raised her brothers on her own
Her parents hated who she loved
She couldn't wait to go to college
She was tired 'cause she was brought
Into a world where family was merely blood

Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
We don't talk much but I just gotta say
"I miss you, and I hope that you're OK."

Address the letters, to the holes in my butterfly wings
Nothing's forever, nothing's as good as it seems
And when the clouds won't iron out
And the monsters creep into your house
And every door is hard to close

Well, I hope you know how proud I am you were created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
God, I hope that you're happier today
'Cause I love you, and I hope that you're OK

"all-american bitch"

I am light as a feather, I'm as stiff as a board
I pay attention to things that most people ignore
And I'm alright with the movies
That make jokes 'bout senseless cruelty, that's for sure
And I am built like a mother and a total machine
I feel for your every little issue, I know just what you mean
And I make light of the darkness
I've got sun in my motherfuckin' pocket, best believe
Yeah, you know me, I

Forgive, and I forget
I know my age, and I act like it
Got what you can't resist
I'm a perfect all-American

I am light as a feather, I'm as fresh as the air
Coca-Cola bottles that I only use to curl my hair
I got class and integrity
Just like a goddamn Kennedy, I swear
With love to spare, I

Forgive, and I forget
I know my age, and I act like it
Got what you can't resist
I'm a perfect all-American bitch
With perfect all-American lips
And perfect all-American hips
I know my place
I know my place, and this is it

I don't get angry when I'm pissed
I'm the eternal optimist
I scream inside to deal with it, like, "Ah"
Like, "Ah" (Oh my fucking God)

All the time
I'm grateful all the time
I'm sexy, and I'm kind
I'm pretty when I cry
Oh, all the time
I'm grateful all the time (Grateful all the fucking time)
I'm sexy, and I'm kind
I'm pretty when I cry

"bad idea right?"

Hey

Haven't heard from you in a couple of months
But I'm out right now and I'm all fucked up
And you're callin' my phone and you're all alone
And I'm sensing some undertone
And I'm right here with all my friends
But you're sending me your new address
And I know we're done, I know we're through
But, God, when I look at you

My brain goes, "Ah"
Can't hear my thoughts (I cannot hear my thoughts)
Like blah-blah-blah (Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah)
Should probably not
I should probably, probably not
I should probably, probably not

Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right?
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right?
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right?
Seeing you tonight
Fuck it, it's fine

Yes, I know that he's my ex
But can't two people reconnect?
I only see him as a friend
The biggest lie I ever said
Oh, yes, I know that he's my ex
But can't two people reconnect?
I only see him as a friend
I just tripped and fell into his bed

Now I'm gettin' in the car, wreckin' all my plans
I know I should stop, but I can't
And I told my friends I was asleep
But I never said where or in whose sheets
And I pull up to your place on the second floor
And you're standing, smiling at the door
And I'm sure I've seen much hotter men
But I really can't remember when

My brain goes, "Ah"
Can't hear my thoughts (I cannot hear my thoughts)
Like blah-blah-blah (Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah)
Should probably not
I should probably, probably not
I should probably, probably not

Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right?
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right?
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right?
Seeing you tonight
Fuck it, it's fine

Yes, I know that he's my ex
But can't two people reconnect?
I only see him as a friend
The biggest lie I ever said
Oh, yes, I know that he's my ex
But can't two people reconnect?
I only see him as a friend
I just tripped and fell into his bed

Oh, yes, I know that he's my ex
Can't two people reconnect?
The biggest lie I ever said
I just tripped and fell into his bed
My brain goes, "Ah"
Can't hear my thoughts
The biggest lie I ever said
My brain goes, "Ah"
Can't hear my thoughts
I just tripped and fell into his bed

Thoughts
Blah
Thoughts
Blah

"vampire"

Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it

I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity

'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naÃ¯ve
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, famefucker
Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire

Every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy God I hate the way I called them crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching? (How do you lie, how do you lie, how do you lie?)

Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her
'Cause girls your age know better

I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naÃ¯ve
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, famefucker
Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire

You said it was true love
But wouldn't that be hard?
You can't love anyone
'Cause that would mean you had a heart
I tried to help you out
Now I know that I can't
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing
I'll never understand

I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naÃ¯ve
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, famefucker
Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire

"lacy"

Lacy, oh, Lacy, skin like puff pastry
Aren't you the sweetest thing on this side of Hell?
Dear angel Lacy, eyes white as daisies
Did I ever tell you that I'm not doin' well?

Ooh, I care, I care, I care
Like perfume that you wear, I linger all the time
Watching, hidden in plain sight
Ooh, I try, I try, I try
But it takes over my life, I see you everywhere
The sweetest torture one could bear

Smart, sexy Lacy, I'm losin' it lately
I feel your compliments like bullets on skin
Dazzling starlet, Bardot reincarnate
Well, aren't you the greatest thing to ever exist?

Ooh, I care, I care, I care
Like ribbons in your hair, my stomach's all in knots
You got the one thing that I want
Ooh, I try, I try, I try
Try to rationalize, people are people, but
It's like you're made of angel dust

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

Lacy, oh, Lacy, it's like you're out to get me
You poison every little thing that I do
Lacy, oh, Lacy, I just loathe you lately
And I despise my jealous eyes and how hard they fell for you
Yeah, I despise my rotten mind and how much it worships you

"ballad of a homeschooled girl"

Cat got my tongue
And I don't think I get along with anyone
Blood running cold
I'm on the outside of the greatest inside joke
And I hate all my clothes
Feels like my skin doesn't fit right over my bones
So I guess I should go
The party's done, and I'm no fun, I know, I know
I know, I know

I broke a glass, I tripped and fell
I told secrets I shouldn't tell
I stumbled over all my words
I made it weird, I made it worse
Each time I step outside
It's social suicide
It's social suicide
Wanna curl up and die
It's social suicide

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah

I laughed at the wrong time, sat with the wrong guy (Uh-huh)
Searchin' "how to start a conversation?" on a website (How to flirt?)
I talked to this hot guy, swore I was his type
Guess that he was makin' out with boys, like the whole night (Oh)
Everythin' I do is tragic (Oh)
Every guy I like is gay (Oh)
The morning after I panic (Oh)
Oh God, what did I say? (Oh, oh, oh)

I broke a glass, I tripped and fell
I told secrets I shouldn't tell
I stumbled over all my words
I made it weird, I made it worse
Each time I step outside
It's social suicide
It's social suicide
Wanna curl up and die
It's social suicide
Yeah, when I'm alone, I'm fine
But don't let me out at night
It's social suicide
It's social suicide

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah

I broke a glass, tripped and fell
Told secrets I shouldn't tell
Stumbled over all my words
Made it weird, then made it worse
Each day that I'm alive
It's social suicide
It's social suicide
Wanna curl up and die
It's social suicide
It's social suicide
Don't let me out at night
I'm shocked I'm still alive
It's social suicide

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah

Thought your mom was your wife (Ah)
Called you the wrong name twice (Ah)
Can't think of a third line (Ah)
La-la-la-la-la-la (Ah)
La-la-la-la-la-la (Ah)
La-la-la-la-la-la (Ah)
La-la-la-la-la-la, ugh

"making the bed"

Want it, so I got it, did it, so it's done
Another thing I ruined, I used to do for fun
Another piece of plastic I could just throw away
Another conversation with nothing good to say
I thought it, so I said it, took it 'cause I can
Another day pretendin' I'm older than I am
Another perfect moment that doesn't feel like mine
Another thing I forced to be a sign

Well, sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
Gettin' drunk at a club with my fair-weather friends
Push away all the people who know me the best
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
I'm so tired of bein' the girl that I am
Every good thing has turned into somethin' I dread
And I'm playin' the victim so well in my head
But it's me who's been makin' the bed

Me who's been makin' the bed
Pull the sheets over my head, yeah
Makin' the bed

And every night, I wake up from this one recurrin' dream
Where I'm drivin' through the city, and the brakes go out on me
I can't stop at the red light, can't swerve off the road
I read somewhere it's 'cause my life feels so out of control
And I tell someone I love them just as a distraction
They tell me that they love me like I'm some tourist attraction
They're changin' my machinery, and I just let it happen
I got the things I wanted, it's just not what I imagined

Well, sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
Gettin' drunk at a club with my fair-weather friends
Push away all the people who know me the best
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
I'm so tired of bein' the girl that I am
Every good thing has turned into somethin' I dread
And I'm playin' the victim so well in my head
But it's me who's been makin' the bed

Me who's been makin' the bed
Pull the sheets over my head, yeah
Makin' the bed

Sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
Countin' all of the beautiful things I regret
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
Me who's been makin' the bed
Pull the sheets over my head
Makin' the bed, oh-oh

"logical"

Master manipulator
God, you're so good at what you do
Come for me like a savior
And I'd put myself through hell for you
Hear all the rumors lately
That you always denied

And I fell for you like water
Falls from the February sky
But now the current's stronger
And I couldn't get out if I tried
But you convinced me, baby
It was all in my mind
And now you got me thinking

Two plus two equals five
And I'm the love of your life
'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
Then changin' you is possible
No, love is never logical

You built a giant castle
With walls so high, I couldn't see
The way it all unraveled
And all the things you did to me
You lied, you lied, you lied
Oh
And now you got me thinkin'

Two plus two equals five
And I'm the love of your life
'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
Then changin' you is possible
I guess love is never logical

The sky is green, the grass is red
And you mean all those words you said
I'm sure that girl is really your friend
Our problems are all solvable
'Cause lovin' you is lovin' every

Argument you held over my head
Brought up the girls you could have instead
Said I was too young, I was too soft
Can't take a joke, can't get you off
Oh, why do I do this?
I look so stupid thinkin'

Two plus two equals five
And I'm the love of your life
'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
Then changin' you is possible
No, love is never logical

Logical, logical, love is never logical
I know I'm half responsible and that makes me feel horrible

Oh, logical, logical, love is never logical
I know I could've stopped it all, God, why didn't I stop it all?

Oh, logical, logical, love is never logical
I know I'm half responsible and that makes me feel horrible

Oh, logical, logical, love is never logical
I know I could've stopped it all, God, why didn't I stop it all?

"get him back"

One, two, three
Wait, is this the song with the drums?

I met a guy in the summer and I left him in the spring
He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye
He said he's six-foot-two and I'm like, "Dude, nice try"
But he was so much fun and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties and the night would never end
Another song, another club, another bar, another dance
And when he said something wrong, he'd just fly me to France
So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed
'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend
Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down
If I had to choose, I would say right now

I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge
And I want him again
I want to get him back, back, back

So I write him all these letters, then I throw them in the trash
'Cause I miss the way he kisses and the way he made me laugh
Yeah, I pour my little heart out, but as I'm hitting "send"
I picture all the faces of my disappointed friends
Because everyone knew all of the shit that he'd do
He said I was the only girl, but that just wasn't the truth
And when I told him how he hurt me, he'd tell me I was trippin'
But I am my father's daughter, so maybe I could fix him

I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge
And I want him again
I want to get him back (And then? And then)
I want to get him back, back, back

I wanna key his car (I want to get him back)
I wanna make him lunch (But then I, I want to get him back)
I wanna break his heart (But then I, I want to get him back)
Then be the one to stitch it up (But then I, I want to get him back)
Wanna kiss his face (But then I, I want to get him back)
With an uppercut (But then I, I want to get him back)
I wanna meet his mom (But then I, I want to get him back)
Just to tell her her son sucks (But then I, I want to get him back)
Oh, I wanna key his car, I wanna make him lunch (But then I, I want to get him back, I want to)
I wanna break his heart, stitch it right back up (But then I, I want to get him back, get him back)
I wanna kiss his face with an uppercut (But then I, I want to get him back, I want to)
I wanna meet his mom and tell her her son sucks, yeah (But then I, I want to get him back, get him back)

I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge
And I want him again
I want to get him back (And then? And then)
I want to get him back (Back, back)

I'll get him, I'll get him, I'll get him, I'll get him back (Woo-hoo)
Get him back (Come on, come on, woo)
I'm gonna get him so good, he's not even gonna know what hit him
He's gonna love me and hate me at the same time
(Get him back, girl, you better get him back)
(You got it, got it)
Oh, I don't know, I got him good, I got him really good

"love is embarrassing"

I told my friends you were the one
After I'd known you like a month
And then you kissed some girl from high school
And I stayed in bed for like a week
When you said space was what you need
Waited by my phone like a goddamn fool

And now it don't mean a thing
God, love's fucking embarrassing
Just watch as I crucify myself
For some weird second string
Loser who's not worth mentionin'
My God, love's embarrassing as hell

And I consoled you while you cried
Over your ex-girlfriend's new guy
My God, how could I be so stupid?
You found a new version of me
And I damn near started World War III
Jesus, what was I even doing?

'Cause now it don't mean a thing
God, love's fucking embarrassing
Just watch as I crucify myself
For some weird second string
Loser who's not worth mentionin'
My God, love's embarrassing as hell

I give up, give up
I give up everything
I placed my bets and
It's not worth anything
I give up, give up
But I keep comin' back for more

Yeah, it don't mean a thing
God, love's fucking embarrassing
Just watch as I crucify myself
For some weird second string
Loser who's not worth mentionin'
My God, love's embarrassing as hell

Yeah, yeah, I give up, give up
I give up everything
I'm plannin' out my wedding
With some guy I'm never marryin'
I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up
But I keep comin' back for more

"the grudge"

I have nightmares each week about that Friday in May
One phone call from you and my entire world was changed
Trust that you betrayed, confusion that still lingers
You took everything I loved and crushed it in between your fingers
And I doubt you ever think about the damage that you did
But I hold on to every detail like my life depends on it
My undying love, now I hold it like a grudge
And I hear your voice every time that I think I'm not enough

And I try to be tough, but I wanna scream
How could anybody do the things you did so easily?
And I say I don't care, I say that I'm fine
But you know I can't let it go
I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long
It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong

The arguments that I have won against you in my head
In the shower, in the car and in the mirror before bed
Yeah, I'm so tough when I'm alone and I make you feel so guilty
And I fantasize about a time you're a little fucking sorry
And I try to understand why you would do this all to me
You must be insecure, you must be so unhappy
And I know in my heart hurt people hurt people
And we both drew blood, but, man, those cuts were never equal

And I try to be tough, but I wanna scream
How could anybody do the things you did so easily?
And I say I don't care, I say that I'm fine
But you know I can't let it go
I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long
It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong

Ooh, do you think I deserved it all?
Ooh, your flower's filled with vitriol
You built me up to watch me fall
You have everything and you still want more

I try to be tough, I try to be mean
But even after all this, you're still everything to me
And I know you don't care, I guess that that's fine
But you know I can't let it go
I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long
It takes strength to forgive, but I'm not quite sure I'm there yet
It takes strength to forgive, but

"pretty isn't pretty"

Bought a bunch of makeup
Tryna' cover up my face
I started to skip lunch
Stopped eatin' cake on birthdays
Bought a new prescription
To try and stay calm
'Cause there's always something missin'
There's always something in the mirror that I think looks wrong

When pretty isn't pretty enough
What do you do?
And everybody's keepin' it up
So you think it's you
I could change up my body and change up my face
I could try every lipstick in every shade
But I'd always feel the same
'Cause pretty isn't pretty enough anyways

You can win the battle
But you'll never win the war
Fix the things you hated
And you'd still feel so insecure

And I try to ignore it, but it's everything I see
It's on the posters on the wall, it's in the shitty magazines
It's in my phone, it's in my head, it's in the boys I bring to bed
It's all around, it's all the time and I don't know why I even try

When pretty isn't pretty enough
What do you do?
And everybody's keepin' it up
So you think it's you
I could change up my body and change up my face
I could try every lipstick in every shade
But I'd always feel the same
'Cause pretty isn't pretty enough

And I bought all the clothes that they told me to buy
I chased some dumb ideal my whole fucking life
And none of it matters and none of it ends
You just feel like shit over and over again

No, it'll never change
Pretty isn't pretty enough
Everybody's keepin' it up
Pretty isn't pretty enough
Pretty isn'tâ

"teenage dream"

When am I gonna stop being wise beyond my years and just start being wise?
When am I gonna stop being a pretty young thing to guys?
When am I gonna stop being great for my age and just start being good?
When will it stop being cool to be quietly misunderstood?

I'll blow out the candles, happy birthday to me
Got your whole life ahead of you, you're only nineteen
But I fear that they already got all the best parts of me
And I'm sorry that I couldn't always be your teenage dream

And when does wide-eyed affection and all good intentions start to not be enough?
When will everyone have every reason to call all my bluffs?
And when are all my excuses of learning my lessons gonna start to feel sad?
Will I spend all the rest of my years wishing I could go back?

I'll blow out the candles, happy birthday to me
Got your whole life ahead of you, you're only nineteen
But I fear that they already got all the best parts of me
And I'm sorry that I couldn't always be your teenage dream

They all say that it gets better
It gets better the more you grow
Yeah, they all say that it gets better
It gets better, but what if I don't?
Oh, they all say that it gets better
It gets better the more you grow
Yeah, they all say that it gets better
It gets better, but what if I don't?
Oh, they all say that it gets better
It gets better the more you grow
Yeah, they all say that it gets better
It gets better, but what if I don't?
Oh, they all say that it gets better
It gets better the more you grow
Yeah, they all say that it gets better
It gets better, but what if I don't?

Is this recording?
Of course it is

"obsessed"

La-da-da-da, da-da-da (Da-da-da-da-da)
La-da-da-da-da

If I told you how much I think about her
You'd think I was in love
And if you knew how much I looked at her pictures
You would think we're best friends

'Cause I know her star sign, I know her blood type
I've seen every movie she's been in and, oh God, she's beautiful
And I know you love her and I know about her
But I can't help it, no, I can't help it

I'm so obsessed with your ex (Uh-huh)
I know she's been asleep on my side of your bed and I can feel it
I'm starin' at her like I wanna get hurt
And I remember every detail you would ever tell me, so be careful, baby
I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)
Yeah, I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)

La-da-da-da, da-da-da

She's got those lips, she's got those hips
The life of every fuckin' party
She's talented, she's good with kids
She even speaks kindly about me, ah-ah

And I know you love me and I know it's crazy
But every time you call my name, I think you mistake me for her
You both have moved on, you don't even talk
But I can't help it, I got issues, I can't help it, baby

I'm so obsessed with your ex
I know she's been asleep on my side in your bed and I can feel her
I'm starin' at her like I wanna get hurt
And I remember every detail you would ever tell me, so be careful, baby
I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)
Yeah, I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)

Is she friends with your friends? Is she good in bed?
Do you think about her? No? I'm fine, it doesn't matter, tell me
Is she easy-goin'? Never controllin'?
Well-traveled? Well-read? Oh God, she's makin' me so obsessed

I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)
She's been asleep on my side in your bed (Ah), woah
I'm so obsessed with your ex (Why'd she make me so obsessed? Ah)
I'm so obsessed with your, with your ex

"scared of my guitar"

Perfect, easy, so good to me
So why's there a pit in my gut in the shape of you?
Distract myself, say it's somethin' else
Maybe I'm just overwhelmed, maybe I'm confused

Barely sleep when you sleep next to me
But I keep thinkin' I'll find a cure
I say that I'm fine, I tell you all the time
I've never felt so happy and sure

But I'm so scared of my guitar
'Cause it cuts right through to the heart
Yeah, it knows me too well so I got no excuse
I can't lie to it the same way that I lie to you
I'm so scared of my guitar
If I play it, then I'll think too hard
Once you let the thought in, then it's already done
So I lay in your arms and pretend that it's love

I was ravin', no boy like you
I had the nerve to just stop stringin' you all along
But I'm not half as decent as you
I'd rather be tied to someone, even if they're wrong

I make excuses, my friends know the truth is
I'm not as alright as I claim
I say that I'm fine, I tell them all the time
As they watch all the life fade away

Yeah, I'm so scared of my guitar
'Cause it cuts right through to the heart
Yeah, it knows me too well so I got no excuse
I can't lie to it the same way that I lie to you
I'm so scared of my guitar
If I play it, then I'll think too hard
Once you let the thought in and then it's already done
So I lay in your arms and pretend that it's love
Yeah, I lay in your arms and pretend that it's love

I pretend that it's love
I pretend that it's love
I pretend that it's love, love

'Cause what if I never find anything better?
The doubt always creeps through my mind
So we'll stay together 'cause how could I ever
Trade somethin' that's good for what's right?

Oh, I'm so scared of my guitar
It cuts right through my heart
It knows me too well, I got no excuse
I can't lie to it the same way that I lie to you
I'm so scared of my guitar
When I play it is when I think too hard
I let the thought in, it's already done
But I lay in your arms and pretend that it's love
Yeah, I lay in your arms and pretend it's enough

"stranger"

I woke up this mornin' and I sat up straight in bed
I had the strangest feeling of this weight off in my chest
I hadn't felt that hopeful since the day that you left and it felt nice
So nice
And everybody told me it would happen in time
The fire would burn out and all the storm clouds would subside
And I always believed that it was some comforting lie that they believe it's nice
So nice

'Cause I was half myself without you and now I feel so complete
And I can't even remember what made me lose all my sleep
I cried a million rivers for you, but that's over now
You're just a stranger I know everything about, ooh, ooh
You're just a stranger I know everything about

Made a pot of coffee and I poured myself a cup
I thought of all the things I did to try and win your love
How did that happen? I can't imagine ever doin' all that stuff for just one guy
Like, you're just some guy
Oh, but I hope that you're happy, babe, you know I really do
And God knows that I am the girl I am because of you
You know I'll always think of you, I'll love you 'til the end of time
You are the best thing that I'll ever keep so far out of my life

Yeah, I was half myself without you and now I feel so complete
I can't even remember what made me lose all my sleep
I cried a million rivers for you, but that's over now
You're just a stranger I know everything about, ooh, ooh
You're just a stranger I know everything about

There's nothin' left for me to know
I had to stay, you had to go
And it was me, but it doesn't matter anymore, no
There's nothin' left for me to sing
I screamed, I cried, I did the whole thing
And I loved you mad, but it doesn't matter anymore, no

I was half myself without you, but now I feel so complete
And if I'm not enough for you, you're not enough for me
I fought a million battles, but you can't get to me now
You're just a stranger I know everything about, ooh, ooh
You're just a stranger I know everything about
You're just a stranger I know everything about

"girl i've always been"

Five, six, five, six, seven, eight

"Baby doll, you have changed"
That's the thing you always say
Cursin' me, trash my name
I rained all over your parade
Now you're on my couch, you're fightin' tears
You say I'm cruel beyond my years
And as I'm walkin' out that door
Say you don't know me anymore

I have captors I call friends
I got panic rooms inside my head
I get down with crooked men
But I am the girl I've always been
I got a wrapped up in the game again
You woke up in an empty bed
And I can't say I'm a perfect ten
But I am the girl I've always been

Ah, mmm

So don't say that I've been acting different
I'm nothin' if I'm not consistent
You knew everything you'd be gettin'
I told you right from the beginnin'
Now you're on my case, how could I go?
You never dreamed I'd be so cold
And then, with venom on your tongue
You ask who I have become

Well, I have captors I call friends
I got panic rooms inside my head
And I get down with the crooked men
But I am the girl I've always been
I got a wrapped up in the game again
You woke up in an empty bed
And I can't say I'm a perfect ten
But I am the girl I've always been

Yeah, I'm a candle in the wind
I'll turn you out, I'll turn you in
But I am the girl I've always been

"21st Century Girls"
(unreleased)

Long, blonde hair
Daddy's a millionaire
Nobody knows her
I mean everybody wants to
That's what I see

Europe trips
Kissing the dream boy's lips
Successful with a smile
She's everything I'll never be

21st century girls are perfect
And I know it isn't real, it sounds so stupid
But digital love, it still feels real to me
She looks like an angel, that's what they'll believe

21st century girls are flawless
And I say I didn't care, but if I am honest
It's hard not to feel like I'm never enough
Yeah, I want that 21st century love

"Apocalyptic Crush"
(unreleased)

Yeah, you must think you're funny calling him at ten o'clock
You think he thinks you're pretty, I can guarantee he does not
I know you see me, do you think that you can win this game?

Yeah, you must think that you're so attractive when you're playing dumb
The only thing you're showing him is how desperate you've become
I hope you trip over the boundaries that you've stepped right over

But go ahead and shoot your shot, baby
Let me know how it goes
Know him better than you thought and I think you should know

You're his apocalyptic crush
He'd like you only if there was
No one left on earth
Babe, I'm sorry if that hurts
But he's mine until then

You're his apocalyptic crush
If we all died you'd be the one
Who'd get to kiss him in the ashes
So, hey, what are the chances of World War III?
'Cause he's never gonna like you like he likes me

"Astronaut"

Ah (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Ah (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Ah (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Ah-ah (Ah, ah)

They say she's pretty
She comes from money
She gives you everything I couldn't give
You take her to the beach
You talk rationally
That's the kind of life I could never live

'Cause I'm an astronaut (Ah, ah)
I'm tethered to the stars (Ah, ah)
Yeah, I'm an astronaut (Ah, ah)
Who still thinks the world could be ours (Ah, ah)

When I sit here and watch you and her from outer space
I watch every part of me be replaced
And slowly, but surely
I drift away

They say you sing to her (Ah-ah)
She understands your humor (Ah-ah)
I'm glad you found yourself someone you can tie down (Ah, ah)
Oh-oh, let me ask you something small (Ah-ah)
Are you recycling it all? (Ah-ah)
All of the sweet little words
And the perfect slow burns
I wonder if you told her I did that shit first (Ah)

Mmm, but I'm an astronaut (Ah)
Could never keep my feet on the ground (Ah, ah)
Yeah, I'm an astronaut (Ah, ah)
My dreams were too big to make you proud (Ah, ah)

So I sit here and watch you and her from outer space
I watch every part of me be replaced
And slowly, but surely
I drift away

You couldn't handle my lunacy, my voice, my opportunity
The distance and my confidence, no you couldn't put up with it
You left me stranded in the stars and ran into another's arms
Will you see me on the T.V. and be proud?
Until then, just please do not forget about

Your little astronaut
Who's tethered to the stars
Your little astronaut
Who still thinks the world could be ours

Who's sittin' and watchin' you and her from outer space
I watch every part of me be replaced
And slowly, but surely, I'll
I'll be okay

Mmm, mmm (Ah, ah)
I'll be okay

"baby is you"
(unreleased)

I know you're with somebody new
But I can't write a song that's not all about you
It's not fair, baby
How come it's so easy
For you to forget everything you said?
Like how I was the best girl that you'd ever met
Guess you take it back
Should've expected that

When I say I'm fine, I'm lyin' really well
'Cause I can't love anyone else
And I'm so jealous that you can
Scared I'll never feel that again
'Cause I still can't call anyone "Baby"
'Cause "Baby" is still you to me
Don't you think I wanna move on, too?
But I can't love anyone the way, the way I loved you

"Can't Catch Me Now"
(from "The Hunger Games: The Ballad Of Songbirds & Snakes" soundtrack)

There's blood on the side of the mountain
There's writing all over the wall
Shadows of us are still dancin'
In every room and every hall
There's snow fallin' over the city
You thought that it would wash away
The bitter taste of my fury
And all of the messes you made
Yeah, you think that you got away

But I'm in the trees, I'm in the breeze
My footsteps on the ground
You'll see my face in every place
But you can't catch me now
Through wading grass, the months will pass
You'll feel it all around
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere
But you can't catch me now
No, you can't catch me now

Bet you thought I'd never do it
Thought it'd go over my head
I bet you figured I'd pass with the winter
Be somethin' easy to forget
Oh, you think I'm gone 'cause I left

But I'm in the trees, I'm in the breeze
My footsteps on the ground
You'll see my face in every place
But you can't catch me now
Through wading grass, the months will pass
You'll feel it all around
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere
But you can't catch me now
No, you can't catch me now

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

You can't, you can't catch me now
I'm comin' like a storm into your town
You can't, you can't catch me now
I'm higher than the hopes that you brought down
You can't, you can't catch me now
I'm comin' like a storm into your town
You can't, you can't catch me now
I'm higher than the hopes that you brought down
You can't, you can't catch me now
I'm comin' like a storm into your town
You can't, you can't catch me now
You can't, you can't, you can't

There's blood on the side of the mountain
It's turning a new shade of red
Yeah, sometimes the fire you founded
Don't burn the way you'd expect
Yeah, you thought that this was the end

"Creature Of Habit"
(unreleased)

Planned out the conversation that we'll have when you see me
For the first time after these months of apathy
And you'll say that you want me back
And I'll say, "Babe, you don't mean that," ah-ah

'Cause I psychoanalyzed you better than your therapist
And I know that you don't love me
I know you just hate the risk of meeting someone else
Having to introduce yourself, ah-ah

You're not a hopeless romantic
You're just a creature of habit
You want me 'cause I'm easy
You want me 'cause you know me
I'm not your soulmate, babe, I swear
No, I'm just there, ah-ah, ah-ah
Oh, I'm just there, ooh-ooh

"Gross"
(unreleased)

Not long ago when I saw you there
With your brown eyed grin and your messy hair
And every girl at the party was looking at you (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I wonder what I'd say if I knew back then
That the brown eyed boy'd be my best friend
And the one I'd give my heart to (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Now everything reminds me of you
Your pictures framed all over my room
And if I hate someone, you'll hate 'em too

As long as I'm your darling angel
I don't need anything in the world
'Cause I feel like the luckiest every second that I'm your girl
I wanna do everything with you
Take the highs, I'll take the lows
I'll keep you close
Give you the most, oh, baby
I like you so much, it's kinda gross
Yeah, I like you so much, it's kinda gross

And driving in your car, I feel all grown up
Is it me or does it feel more than high school love?
Not gonna lie, your last name sounds so ni-i-i-ce
I love when you complain about things like traffic
Love when you're tired, baby, I like all of it
Honestly, I can't believe you're mi-i-i-ine

I bring you up in every conversation
We're young, I know we gotta be patient
But I know I want my life to have you in it

Ooh, and as long as I'm your darling angel
I don't need anything in the world
'Cause I feel like the luckiest every second that I'm your girl
I wanna do everything with you
Take the highs, I'll take the lows
I'll keep you close
Give you the most, oh, baby
I like you so much, it's kinda gross
Yeah, I like you so much, it's kinda gross

"Just Because"
(unreleased)

I like the way you talk when you've just woken up
And I like the way we can joke about offensive stuff
I like the way you give homeless men your mittens
When you're all out of spare change
And I like the way you think, I like your reasoning
Everyone thinks you're brilliant, you think you don't know anything
I like the way you care, you're nice when no one's there
God, I hope you never change

'Cause people love to talk
And people always want something from you
'Cause that's what people do
But I don't want a thing
I think you're astounding
And I don't care what anyone says or what anyone does
'Cause, boy, I like you
And I like you just because

"L-O-V-E"
(unreleased)

A Monday morning you meet me at the hotel, and
You bought me coffee just to spill it on yourself
But you never take things seriously
It's kinda why I like you so much, honestly

And I wrote a note and left it folded in your pocket
You taped it to your wall in your New York apartment
Kissing in the taxi cab
'Til the driver gives us dirty looks back

Oh, it's L-O-V-E, or something like that
You're crazy, but it's not in a bad way
Dancing on the highway
You make me feel older than seventeen

Yeah, this is L-O-V-E, or something really close
Hey, baby, I think you're really dope
I honestly don't know why
I should ever leave your side
'Cause this is love, right?

"Never Be Like Her"
(unreleased)

Blonde hair falls just above her shoulders
She's nineteen, but she looks a little older
With the prom queen smile, the cool vintage style
You're obsessed with her, and I don't blame you for it

But I'll never look like her
Not even if I tried
I'll never be cooler
Not even if I lied
Oh, she's whole where I am broken
She's great where I am good
And I'll never be like her
But you know I wish I could

"Pay Grade"
(unreleased)

You call me every night and tell me that you feel like shit
I say, "I'm sorry, is there any way I can help with it?"
I listen to you scream, the world is simply your enemy
"With death and taxes, what's the point of tryna be happy?"

And I've had bad days, bad years
Bad boys and bad careers
But I'm still standin' here
I understand you, darlin', but at the end of the day
You just won't help yourself
Rather give someone else
A glimpse into your hell
Pour all your problems on 'em just so you can walk away

Boy, I'm too young to be your mother
Not smart enough to be your therapist either
And I'm always here if you need a talk
But maybe first, you should take a walk
'Cause I'm not gonna make you change
That's above my pay grade, babe

"Pretender"
(unreleased)

What lies behind
Your pretty house with the white picket fence
And all the Barbies that you call your friends?

Is your life a lie?
Nothing's as good as it seems
And you're not the girl of their dreams

Oh, and maybe your life is all flowers
Maybe I'm insecure
Maybe you're good at taking pictures
Maybe you're a pretender, oh

Pretender, I'm pointing my finger at you
Pretender, if only they knew what I knew
Yeah, if only they knew what I knew

I'm happy with me
Think that's supposed to be enough
So why am I sulking, calling your bluff?

Maybe your life is all flowers
Maybe I'm insecure
And maybe you're good at taking pictures
You're a pretender

Pretender, I'm pointing my finger at you
Pretender, if only they knew what I knew
Yeah, if only they knew what I knew

Pretender, I guess you're really not so bad
Maybe you pretend
But you look like you got the life I wish I had
I created you
To be plastic and deadly
I created you
To hide my own envy
To hide my own envy, yeah

Pretender, I wish I knew what you knew
Pretender, if only I was like you
Maybe I'm a pretender like you

"Prison For Life"

Just a boy in a Chevy truck
He's got money, but not too much
And he calls me, "Baby girl"
I run my hands through his curls
And my parents think he's good
And he is, but rest assured
He's anything but sweet
If someone comes for me

I'm a feminist obviously (Oh)
But I wouldn't really mind him saving me (Ah)
And I know that I'm fine without a man (Ah)
But I think I would like his protection (Ah)
I'm just being honest, can't change what I like
I'll never forget it, he told me one night
"If anybody hurts you, ha
I'm going to prison for life"

I'm no damsel in distress, no
But I like assertiveness, so
Wrap your arm around me, babe
And tell me that you'll keep me safe
I know it's bad to fantasize
About robbers and bad guys
But if you were there to save the day, ha
Think I'll let them in a merry way

I'm a feminist obviously (Oh)
But I wouldn't really mind him saving me (Ah)
And I know that I'm fine without a man (Ah)
But I think I would like his protection (Ah)
I'm just being honest, can't change what I like
I'll never forget it, he told me one night
"If anybody hurts you, ha
I'm going to prison for life"

(I) I know I can protect myself
(I) But when you do it for me, it's hot as hell
(I) You got my heart, you know me too well
(I) Think I'd even send you love letters in jail
(I)

I'm a feminist obviously (Oh)
But I wouldn't really mind him saving me (Saving me)
And I know that I'm fine without a man (A man)
But I think I would like his protection (Protection)
And God knows that I don't need no one
But pretending that I do is kind of fun (Kind of fun)
Yeah, I know that I'm fine without a man
But I think I'd like his protection (I'd like his protection)
I'm just being honest, can't change what I like
I'll never forget it, he told me one night (Night)
"If anybody hurts you, oh
I'm going to prison for life"

"Rebel Without A Clue"
(unreleased)

Sitting in my room
What's it all about?
Feels like the world is gonna end
Before I figure her out

Drink up, my friend
My potion of emotion
Can you feel the love, the hate, the jealousy?
The sheer confusion?

'Cause I don't really know who I am
Or how to present that to you
I don't really know just who I am
I'm a rebel without a clue, oh

Let's sit, watch the trains all derail
They want me to learn
Well, they can sit and watch me fail
Are my friends changin'?
Or is it in my mind?
Will I ever shake hands with time?

'Cause I don't really know who I am
Or how to present that to you
I don't really know just who I am
I'm a rebel without a clue, oh, no

I don't really know who I am
And now you want me to change
I don't really know what I am
Isn't everything just so strange?

Sitting in my room
What's it all about? Oh

"Strange"
(unreleased)

Oh no
Your voice through the phone
Tells me way more, than I ever wanted to know
You say, that you need your space
That letting me go
Was the hardest thing you could do cause
You're crazy for me, and I'm the best that you ever had

Oh no
It's kinda funny

Said it was raining but the suns out
Said you loved me, you're with her now
And I don't need you to explain
I'm just saying that it's strange
Said you couldn't live without me
Heard you're dancing at a party
And I don't wanna take her place
I'm just saying that it's strange

Strange, strange, strange
Strange, strange, strange

Oh no
I saw you and her
Out on the street
You were never that public with me
I know
That you met her when you were with me
I said I had doubts and you said I was crazy
Baby, was I crazy after all?
Oh, oh, it's really funny

Said it was raining but the suns out
Said you loved me, you're with her now
And I don't need you to explain
I'm just saying that it's strange
Said you couldn't live without me
Heard you're dancing at a party
And I don't wanna take her place
I'm just saying that it's strange

Strange, strange, strange
Strange, strange, strange
I'm just saying that it's strange
Strange, strange, strange
Strange, strange, strange

Oh no, I guess I was right
Wish I was wrong
Me and my heart will be fine

Said it was raining but the suns out
Said you loved me, you're with her now
And I don't need you to explain
I'm just saying that it's strange
Said you couldn't live without me
Heard you're dancing at a party
And I don't wanna take her place
I'm just saying that it's strange

Strange, strange, strange
Strange, strange, strange
I'm just saying that it's strange
Strange, strange, strange
Strange, strange, strange

"The Ones I Love"

Sit in your car, wait in the dark
Radio is up and so is your guard
You don't know what to say
You're faking a smile, you say that you're fine
And maybe it'll all work out in time
You've always been good that way

Feel like I've done this before
You're fighting your tears as I open the door
And you deserve much more

Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
And I watch you cry, 'cause I wasn't enough
Watch you disappearing down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most

You told me your past
You hated your dad
And when you left college, couldn't wait to go back
'Cause you really trusted me
And what did I do? What did I do?
I built you up, abandoned you
And I'm too proud to say sorry

Feel like I've done this before
You're fighting your tears as I open the door
And you deserve much more

Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
And I watch you cry, 'cause I wasn't enough
Watch you disappearing down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most

I didn't mean it, baby
I didn't think it all through
I didn't mean it, baby
Always ruin good things like you
I watched the life drain out of your eyes
And it's no surprise
It's no surprise

Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
Now I watch you cry, 'cause I wasn't enough
I watch you disappearing down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
And I watch you cry, 'cause I wasn't enough
Watch you disappearing down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
The ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Ones I love the most

"Victim"
(unreleased)

I've been bad to boys I love
Maybe I'm selfish, maybe I'm young
And my guilty Catholic heart tears my guilty self apart on the floor
But I wish that you did something bad so we could settle the score

Let me be the victim of your perfect crime
Bathe in my blood so I'm not the bad guy
I messed up so maybe mess up too
Really want the blame to be on you
So, drive the knife in deep
Make the victim me

Then I'll hear the yells and see the red and blue
It'll be in the headlines, all our friends will hate you
I know I didn't deserve you, but now, it's vice versa
You'll finally see how it tastes
'Cause hurting the one that you swore you'd protect is the worst kind of heartbreak

So, let me be the victim of your perfect crime
I'll kill your conscience like you killed mine
Yeah, I messed up so maybe mess up, too
Really want the blame to be on you
So, drive the knife in deep
And make the victim me
Me, oh...

"White Flowers"
(unreleased)

White flowers and love letters
You say I'm yours forever
But it don't feel romantic, somehow

I'm pacing and I'm losing sleep
If you don't call, I start to weep
You're everything I cannot do without

I don't know who I would be
If I wasn't your baby
I built my life on your attention
On being an object of your affection

Now, crazy in love don't feel sweet
'Cause I'm with you but I miss me
Wish somebody had told me what I know now
Losing yourself in someone isn't Heaven, it's Hell
