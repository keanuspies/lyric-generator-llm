"Home Alone"

I'm awake
Can you see me now
And if you stay
We can lounge about
And I'm getting tired
But you make me feel awake
And at the end of the night
Maybe we can stay up late

'Cause I'm just all alone
Sitting at home
And you should stay
If you don't mind
I'll be okay
If you stay
'Cause you should stay
If you don't mind

On my own
I miss you here
Sun is gone
And the clouds are near
And I'm getting tired of being
By myself
'Cause at the end of the night
Maybe you can help yourself

'Cause I'm just all alone
Sitting at home
And you should stay
If you don't mind
I'll be okay
If you stay
'Cause you should stay
If you don't mind

I'm just all alone
Sitting at home
And you should stay
If you don't mind
I'll be okay
If you stay
'Cause you should stay
If you don't mind

"Bobby"

Bobby was fourteen when she knew
Nothing would last
Wishing her life wouldn't be this bad
'Cause Bobby always thought like this with her thought of having missed
Every little thing life could bring she dismissed
'Cause Bobby always saw the bad onto the life she had
Who could have blamed the girl
Bobby was fourteen years old, Bobby was fourteen years old

Bobby was fourteen when she knew
Nothing would last
Wishing her mind didn't think so sad
'Cause Bobby always had a stitch on the left side of her wrist
Despite the love she'd get she dismissed
'Cause Bobby always saw the bad onto the life she had
Who could have blamed the girl
Bobby was fourteen years old, Bobby was fourteen years old

And Bobby knew if she'd ended it all it would be better soon
And if she tried, she would've missed out being happy and be a fool
But deep down bobby knew she'd find someone like you

Bobby was fifteen when she knew
Something's would last
Wishing her mind never thought that bad
'Cause bobby still had the stitch on the left side of her wrist
She got all life could give that she'd missed

"Spacing Out"

Can't you see
Can't you notice
Somehow tough and I'm pretty broken
Just because I'm fine doesnt mean I'm alright
And I need someone to say okay
I need someone to say It's fine

I'm just stressing out
I need something to hold me
I need something to hold me
I'm just spacing out
I need something to catch me
I need something to catch me

Are you dumb are you stupid
Is it me or is it pretty obvious
Just because I don't talk doesn't mean I go talking
'Cause sometimes I keep to myself
And sometimes it's helps with my friend

I'm just stressing out
I need something to hold me
I need something to hold me
I'm just spacing out
I need something to catch me
I need something to catch me
I'm just stressing out
I need something to hold me
I need something to hold me

"Angry Song"

Pick up the phone
Please, tell me you're home
The monsters are gone
The wardrobe is closed
Where's my guitar
They hate when I sing
So, fuck my guitar, yeah
Fuck everything

Mmmm mmmm [x2]

String's on a twist
My ass they can kiss
They're making me sick
Just, go suck my dick
No, singing past ten
You can't stay in your bed
So, fuck mom and dad
I'm going real mad

Mmmm mmmm [x4]

"Everest"

You're alright, you're still breathing
Even though you feel dead sometimes
You'll be fine, you're still eating
Even though it doesn't last sometimes

'Cause even if your eyes are black
Your bones are always gold
'Cause it's climbed up every mountain
That no story's ever told
'Cause even if your bags are packed
You'll never leave your home
'Cause you're scared of all the monsters
That are waiting to unfold

Blank noise is an awful sound
And it hurts my ears, I don't know how
My name's just a silhouette
Hiding under all the self-doubt

'Cause even if your eyes are black
Your bones are always gold
'Cause it's climbed up every mountain
That no story's ever told
'Cause even if your bags are packed
You'll never leave your home
'Cause you're scared of all the monsters
That are waiting to unfold

Boy, I'm scared
Boy, I'm scared
Boy, I'm scared
Boy, I'm scared

"Tired"

You haven't been good for long
Is it the sound of your own thoughts
That always keeps you up at night?
Maybe it's time to say goodbye
'Cause I'm getting pretty fucking tired

You haven't felt right for days
Is it the fact you never say
What comes in your mind that day?
Maybe it's time to shut away
'Cause I've never really felt okay

'Cause I've been eating less all day
To give my brain some extra space to think
'Bout all the things to do to help
Distract me from the rude of heart

"Dance With Me"

If you wanna dance then
Dance with me
It's pretty fast but
This is what you do at parties, right?

And I know it's hard to tell
But I think I really like you

Just take it slow
And move your feet to the beat
'Cause if we dance then
You don't have to speak

And I know it's hard to tell
But I think I really like you

"Art Class"

You look pretty good today
Is it me or did you shave?
Good, you've been looking at me twice as more
So I can see your face
You sit across from me, in the classroom
But do you even know my name?
If you want to ask me how I am
Don't hesitate

'Cause you're my cru- cru- crush
And I like you very much
And I'd appreciate
If you'd like me back
But it's okay, 'cause you make my heart
In art class
In art class

Why do you always stick to smiling
And sit still being so quiet?
I've been pretty distracted for some days
And it's ruining my diet
If you don't take the hint already
I'm afraid I'll start a riot
'Cause you make my whole world go crazy
Yeah your smell just sends me flying

'Cause you're my cru- cru- crush
And I like you very much
And I'd appreciate
If you'd like me back
But it's okay, 'cause you make my heart
In art class
In art class

All my days
Been trying to find a reason to stay
Say my name
And I'll go ahead and pick a date
I'm okay
If you understand that this is fate

Art class
Art class
Art class
Art class

"If You Want To"

If you wanna take me
Go ahead and try my head
Experience is nothing compared to
The sleep paralysis in my bed
If you wanna love me
Try to get inside my brain
Experience is nothing compared to
The nights I'm always up so late

Bed bugs in my mind
Keep them all alive
Insomnia creeps at night
Sleep paralysis till I die
Die

'Cause if you want, you could stay with me in my bed
If you want to, only if you want to
If you want, you could go ahead and fix my head
If you want to, only if you want to

If you wanted to
If you try to

Wishing I still had my dreams
Late night started, take up space
'Cause every time I try to remember
Lack of sleep takes half my brain

Bed bugs in my mind
Keep them all alive
Insomnia creeps at night
Sleep paralysis till I die
Die

'Cause if you want, you could stay with me in my bed
If you want to, only if you want to
If you want, you could go ahead and fix my head
If you want to, only if you want to
Use some pesticides and throw it in my brain
If you want to, only if you want to
Bed bugs keep me up at night and I'm going insane
If they try to, only if they try to

If you wanted to
If you try to

'Cause if you want, you could stay with me in my bed
If you want to, only if you want to
If you want, you could go ahead and fix my head
If you want to, only if you want to
Use some pesticides and throw it in my brain
If you want to, only if you want to
Bed bugs keep me up at night and I'm going insane
If they try to, only if they try to

"Eighteen"

Don't wanna be eighteen with responsibilities
Sometimes I get scared of growing up
Entering a world with broken dreams
Sometimes I get scared and throw it all up

And June the third is
Coming closer and I'm
Nowhere near closure

Don't wanna be eighteen when I can't ride a bike
Still hang onto my sheets during storms
In my bed I'm ten but I can't shut my eyes
I still wish I wore a school uniform

And June the third is
Coming closer and I'm
Nowhere near closure

Don't wanna be eighteen with a messy room
Still wonder what lingers under my bed at night
Kinda wish I stayed at my mother's home
Are we gonna know what it's like to be blind?

'Cause June the third is
Coming closer and I'm
Nowhere near closure

"The Way I Spoke"

Think I saw you on the bus just yesterday
Wearing that blue shirt you said you liked that day
The image now is just blurred in my mind

But do you recall the time we talked?
The day you held my hand?
We were by a station
The sky was dark in sight
The moon was out but the sun was in your eyes
No one talked but I did
You listened
You said you liked the way I spoke

I think I saw you in my dream last night
It was cold with lots of pretty lights
The image now is just blurred in my mind

But do you recall the time we talked?
The day you kissed me?
We were by an archway
With flowers cascading round the roof
Standing under my winter coat to shelter us
You said you liked the way I spoke

And if you'd like to hold my hand
It would bring back all the things we had
And if God were to take that all away
Wouldn't that be a shame?

"Disappear"

Kiss me on my neck
Tell me all your fears
'Cause the rush of love is gone
I'm tryna find out why it disappeared
Why it disappeared

I look you in the eyes
Don't feel nothing here
'Cause the feeling of the love that I used to have
Well that shit's disappeared
Yeah that shit's disappeared
Yeah that shit's disappeared
Yeah that shit's disappeared
Yeah that shit's disappeared

Do you remember
Our love in November
That shit was so real
But there's patches on my fingers that won't heal
There's patches on my fingers that won't feel
Why'd you have to fucking disappear
Why'd you have to fucking disappear
Why'd you disappear
Why'd you disappear
Why'd you disappear
Why'd you disappear

Please come back
Please come back
Please come back
Please come back

"1999"

Hold me close and say you care
Because I'm in love with your brown hair
The way you touch me is a curse
And I'm not willing to let it hurt

Watch your mouth and wash with soap
Because I just hate the way you spoke
Green eyes make everything feel numb
So I'm not willing to give it all up

And I'm not wasting time again
Closure instead of sex
I'm not wasting time again

You said I fucked up and ruined your life
Little did you know you ruined
Mine

"Apple Cider"

We both like apple cider
But your hair be smelling like fruit punch
And I don't even like you that much
Wait
I do
FUCK

Call me
At midnight
Let's give this
Thing a try

You said you liked my hair
So go ahead and touch it
You said you liked the jumper I wore
So I always wore it
It's really nice to talk to you
It's really nice to hold your hand
It's really nice to talk to you
It's really nice to hold your hand
And even if we're just friends
We could be more than that
And even if we're just friends
We could be more than that

So call me
At midnight
Let's give this thing
A try

Call me
At midnight
Let's give this thing
A try

So call me
At midnight
Ask if it's alright
To have a sleepover
To drink some apple cider
Or maybe some fruit punch
And we can talk about how we don't like each other that much

"Ceilings"

Love me like a garden filled with flowers
Like the driest desert in the rain
Love me like cigarettes in Paris
Love me like a book that has no name

Let the birds sing
Let the fish swim
And appreciate the life you live

Miss me like the scent of your first room
The thing you've always wanted to go back to
Ceilings were so high when you were five
Miss me like the way your mother misses your height

Let the birds sing
Let the fish swim
And appreciate the life you live

"Angel"

White angel come
Intoxicate my blood
Just another hit
You'd get used to it
Just another grit

Your bones are only painted gold
That's why it rots beneath your soul
You're not as brave as you may seem
That's why it hurts me

I'm scared of life
It's in my blood
So I blame myself
I blame myself
I blame myself
White pretty snowflakes
White pretty snowflakes
White pretty snowflakes
Falling on my face

Your bones are only painted gold
That's why it rots beneath your soul
You're not as brave as you may seem
That's why it hurts me

"You Lie All the Time"

You lie all the time
Yeah you do
But I can't complain
'Cause I'm just afraid of losing you

You don't understand
Yeah you don't
'Cause if I explained
You'd just hate the way it goes

So tell me it's okay
That everything is great
'Cause I just hate the fact
That every time we do
You look the other way

You say it's alright
Yeah you do
But it's fine
'Cause you hate to see me cry
Cry
Cry

So tell me it's okay
That everything is great
'Cause I just hate the fact
That every time we do
You look the other way

And if you ask me
What I'd wanna do
I'd look you in the eyes
And end up asking you (oh)
You (oh)
Oh you
Oh you

"Soren"

Miss your hair
I like the way you stare
Into my eyes
Most the time
The way you touch me
Is like a curse that can't be broken
But it hurts
Most the time

And if there was a place
That I had to choose
Or a memory that fades
That I cannot lose
If there was a place
That I could call home
Before I'd die you'd ought to know
It would be in your arms tonight

The green in your eyes
Are like the leaves in the summer
And it changes
With the weather
The pink in your cheeks
When you slightly loose your temper
Makes me love you
Even more

And if there was a place
That I had to choose
Or a memory that fades
That I cannot lose
If there was a place
That I could call home
Before I'd die you'd ought to know
It would be in your arms tonight
It'd be in your arms tonight
It'd be in your arms tonight

"Are You Sure"

You say you understand
Are you sure, are you sure?
You say you've been to Mars before
Are you sure, are you sure?

It's funny for you
My state stays the same in outer space
It's funny for you
It's obvious you've never felt this way
It's pretty shit
My brain's alone and no one understands

You think you know my brain
Are you sure, are you sure?
You think you know just what to say
Are you sure, are you sure?

It's funny for you
My state stays the same in outer space
It's funny for you
It's obvious you've never felt this way
It's pretty shit
My brain's alone and no one understands

So talk to me again
You seem to understand
You claim to say its fine
But you never really know where I am
Why
Why
Why
Why

It's funny for you
My state stays the same in outer space
It's funny for you
It's obvious you've never felt this way
It's pretty shit
My brain's alone and no one understands

"I Wish I Was Stephen Malkmus"

Think I'm starting to change
With the weeks and the days
Got this new blue-haired phase

I think I kinda like it, think I kinda like it
Yeah

Think I kinda like it
'Cause I get tired of the same shit
Got new hair, a new phase
I'm from outer space
And I'm pretty sure I'll get used to it

Guess I'm tryna get by
'Cause like the weather, I change with time

And I sit at home, cry to Pavement
I wish I was Stephen Malkmus
I wanted change, no one forced it
My hair is blue, it's pretty obvious
That I kinda like it, think I kinda like it
Yeah

Think I kinda like it
'Cause I get tired of the same shit
Got new hair, a new phase
I'm from outer space
And I'm pretty sure I'll get used to it

Now I've changed, I've been feeling comfy
But now I've changed, I've been feeling lonely
'Cause your photos suck, your brand is shit
You're up your butt
You never really ask me how I am, ask me how I am

'Cause I sit at home, cry to Pavement
I wish I was Stephen Malkmus
I wanted change, no one forced it
My hair is blue, it's pretty obvious
That I kinda like it, think I kinda like it
Nice

Think I kinda like it
'Cause I get tired of the same shit
Got new hair, a new phase
I'm from outer space
And I'm pretty sure I'll get used to it

Fuck

"Sun More Often"

Keep your head down low
Cause is it the sound, or is it the way things go?
In your head you're scared
So just sing along to the song in end

Cause if you try to ask me how
You'll never know what to expect how to get up
You should go out and see the sun more often
You should go out and see the sun more often

If you tried you'll see
That the world's not as scary as it seems

Cause if you try to ask me how
You'll never know what to expect how to get up
You should go out and see the sun more often
You should go out and see the sun more often

Go out and see the sun more often
Go out and see the sun more often
Go out and see the sun

Go out and see the sun more often
Go out and see the sun more often
Go out and see the sun more often

"She Plays Bass"

Hey, won't you call me back?
'Cause I've been waiting for a text back
It hurts my brain
This chick who plays bass

She plays bass, she plays bass
Nothing matters 'cause we're both in space
Pretty shit we could never date
She plays bass, she plays bass

Guess we're both stuck in the same boat
The world doesn't seem to get us though
You're just stuck in space
Just playing your bass

She plays bass, she plays bass
Nothing matters 'cause we're both in space
Pretty shit we could never date
She plays bass, she plays bass

She plays bass, she plays bass
Nothing matters 'cause we're both in space
How I wish we could just date
So you could teach me how to be more like you

Wish I was more like you
Wish I was more like you
Wish I was more like you

"Space Cadet"

Feeling shit again
Haven't left my bed
Never brush my hair
And if you look me in the eyes you'll see that I don't care

You don't seem to understand
This candy floss made spacecraft
Took the dirt out from my brain
Threw them out to outer space

Through the Milky Way
Past the morning sun
Pluto is lightyears away
And all our fears, they're all gone

Let loose, we live only for a little while
In hindsight, we'll die anyways
Extraterrestrial beings probably sitting tight
Waiting to blow our brains away

Through the Milky Way
Past the morning sun
Pluto is lightyears away
And all our worries, they're all gone

So quit being so negative
It's fine don't be a temporary fix
You say I don't write happy songs
So I guess this is the first one

Through the Milky Way
Past the morning sun
Pluto is lightyears away
And all our worries, they're all gone

"Care"

It's been a while since I've talked about it
Maybe it's time to co-operate
I need some help to forget about it
I don't want your sympathy
Stop saying you give a shit
Because you don't really care
Care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah

It's been a while since I've thought about it
Maybe it's time to communicate
I was seven to think about it
The fact I still can't forget about it
I don't want your sympathy
I guess I've had it rough
But you don't really care
Care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah

Oh, by the way I'm still the same
I'm still the same
But are you the same?
Oh, by the way I'm still the same
I'm still the same
But are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Forget about it

I don't want your sympathy
I guess I've had it rough
But you don't really care
Care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah

Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Oh-oh, oh-oh
You, you-ou

Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you the same?
Are you?

"Worth It"

Your eyes are just like his but your face is a bit different
You're a bit more fucked but I guess that's fine
Maybe, that's what I want this time

Say that you're breaking up
Connection too slow
So just try texting again
Don't pick up the phone
Don't think we can be friends
'Cause you're too pretty
I wanna see you again
I don't know what I'm saying

This is too bad to boast
But this is my way to float
And if I shut up I'm scared I'll drown
But maybe that's the best for now

Say that you're breaking up
Connection too slow
So just try texting again
Don't pick up the phone
Don't think we can be friends
'Cause you're too pretty
I wanna see you again
I don't know what I'm saying

Don't think this is worth it
Don't think this is worth it
I'm not wasting time
But you've been on my mind
Don't think this is worth it
This time

Say that you're breaking up
Connection too slow
So just try texting again
Don't pick up the phone
Don't think we can be friends
'Cause you're too pretty
I wanna see you again
I don't know what I'm saying

Say that you're breaking up
Connection too slow
So just try texting again
Don't pick up the phone
Don't think we can be friends
'Cause you're too pretty
I wanna see you again
I don't know what I'm saying

"Dye It Red"

Kiss my ass, you don't know jack
And if you say you understand you don't
You don't
You don't
You don't

Fuck me, only when I'm keen
Not according to your beer
Your beer
Your beer
Your beer

So let me be what I've wanted to be

So let me cut my hair and dye it red if I want to
I haven't found myself so comfortable
I'm not stopping now

Touch me as if you mean it
Because I'm getting tired of being all alone
Alone
Alone
Alone

And if it's not for you guess I'll find it on my own

So let me cut my hair and dye it red if I want to
I haven't found myself so comfortable
I'm not stopping

Think I'd be better off alone
Now that I had some time to think
I've had to put up with your shit
When you're not even that cute

And maybe it's time to change my ways
But that doesn't include you

Let me cut my hair and dye it red if I want to
I haven't found myself so comfortable
I'm not stopping

Think I'd be better off alone
Now that I had some time to think
I've had to put up with your shit
When you're not even that cute

That cute
That cute
That cute

"Back To Mars"

Ask me again, are we friends or are we something more?
Doesn't it hurt to think about how we were just before?
Doesn't matter if sometimes we cannot stick to being friends
Doesn't matter if we break up just to act all fine again

Take me to the South of France where we could just be old friends
We'd go to the beach and you could braid my hair
You could braid my hair

"Charlie Brown"

Back on old habits
That no one knows about
Too bad that Charlie Brown
Has inked you up to slow you down
Has inked you up to slow you down

Throw it away
Throw it away
Throw it away

I call you if I need you
Give my brain a sec
I just need to figure things out
Figure things out

Throw it away
Throw it away
Throw it away

If I could die here a million times
Then what's the point of trying?

Throw it away
Throw it away
Throw it away
Throw it away

"Emo Song"

Back on old ways, I know your face
I haven't seen you in some days
It hurts my head, my conscience dead
The fact I miss the way it felt

You're coming back again
Don't want you back again

You call me up and lie again
Like all the men I use to trust
Nobody knows when I was young
I lost my self in cosmic dust

You're coming back again
Don't want you back again

Just the thought of you doesn't stop
You're not a person or a thing
Just the thought of you on my limbs
It's all your fault
It's all your fault
It's all your fault
It's all your fault

"Sorry"

Sad I had to see you
But I don't and I won't and I won't
To think I was just like you
All alone skin to bone, skin to bone

And it hurts me
That you could be the one that deserved this
Even more
That you stayed in the same dark place that I adore
But you stayed for more
I guess that's what happens to the best of us
The best of us

I hope to come and see you
When your state's doing great, doing great
A part of me feels for you
That I'm doing alright and guess I've been feeling fine

But it hurts me
That you could be the one that deserved this
Even more
That you stayed in the same dark place that I adore
But you stayed for more
I guess that's what happens to the best of us
The best of us

I never want to think twice
With what could have been your life

And I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

And it hurts me
That you could be the one that deserved this
Even more
That you stayed in the same dark place that I adore
But you stayed for more
I guess that's what happens to the best of us
The best of us

And I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

"Further Away"

Say what you want
It's hard 'cause it sucks
I'll just pretend to give a fuck
Maybe then you'll try to stop

'Cause was it so hard
To keep your mouth shut?
They say the moon's miles away but your brain's further away

Who's laughing now?
The shit that you used to say is out your mouth
Guess you feel better now?

'Cause was it so hard
To keep your mouth shut?
They say the moon's miles away but your brain's further away

Further away
Further away
Further away

"Horen Sarrison"

You are the smell of pavement after the rain
You are the last empty seat on a train
And I'm convinced you're from outer space

And I want you to know that I'm in love
But I don't want you to feel comfortable

You are the song that I need for my mental state
You are the bus that stayed when I thought I was late
So I'm convinced you're from outer space

And I want you to know that I'm in love
But I don't want you to feel comfortable

Eyes so green, I don't know what that means
But you make me feel like all this is real
But I don't want you to feel comfortable

And I want you to know that I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love

And I want to keep you quiet
And I know you feel the same
And I'm sorry I'm gone so often
But I know you'd do the same
The same
The same

I want you to know that I'm in love
But I don't want you to feel comfortable

Eyes so green, I don't know what that means
But you make me feel like all this is real
But I don't want you to feel comfortable

And I want you to know that I'm in love

"How Was Your Day?"

How was your day?
Was it okay?
'Cause we haven't talked in a while
Forgotten how you used to smile

What do you look like?
Remember when we used to fight?

And I miss getting angry at you
'Cause at least I felt something new

'Cause I miss all the fuck ups we've had
'Cause even then you're the best that I've had

Call me up late
Say it's okay
'Cause I'll be away a while
I can't remember your smile

You used to kiss me
Guess it's not hard to believe
That I miss getting angry at you
'Cause at least I felt something new

'Cause I miss all the fuck ups we've had
'Cause even then you're the best that I've had

'Cause even when we're miles away I know
You'll still want me as usual

But the thing that I know is that I wanna be with you

How was your day?
Was it okay?
'Cause we haven't talked in a while
Remember when we used to smile
You used to miss me
Guess it's not hard to believe
That things have to change like the weather and the days

But the thing that I know is that I wanna be with you

"Together"

Crash the car again
The same mistakes again
Don't wanna hurt you like I did

'Cause I'm not waiting for you
But I don't want to hurt you

All alone again
It hurts my heart again
I think my blood is running thin

I'm away again
It hurts my head again
Don't wanna be away from your skin

'Cause I'm not waiting for you
But I don't want to hurt you

Guess that's how my life will go
At least we're together though
Together though
Together though
Together though

Hurt myself again
I thought you'd notice it
Don't wanna fix it like you did

'Cause I don't want to let you know
I've been thinking of letting you go
Guess that's how the story ends
At least we're together again
Together again
Together again
Together again

Fine I'm okay by myself
I'm doing great
But we'd be better together
Better together
Together though
Together though
Together again

"Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene"

He-, hold up, fuck
He-, what the fuck?
Sounds like a fart
(One, two, three, four)

He smells very nice
Oh so nice
Wears clothes that I like
He doesn't even try
He doesn't even try

And I think that I want to marry him
But I really don't want to freak him out
I know all our children's names
They're called Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

Loves me till I die
I'll be his corpse bride
And when I smell he says it's fine
Oh how nice

And I think that I want to marry him
But I really don't want to freak him out
I know all our children's names
They're called Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

I'm scared he's gonna leave me
'Cause when I'm mad I get pretty scary
But he won't and he won't because I'm pretty
And we'll have lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots
Of babies

Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

"First Date"

Meet me by the corner shop
The one that sells the flower pot
To tell me that you bought it with your cash
And not your mother's coupons

Build a rocket ship out of soft clay
And take me right up into space
And I can see how our day went
We'll see if we're just friends

'Cause I know you know
It's still pretty awkward
Grow some balls and just say
Where'd you wanna go, where'd you
Where'd you wanna go on our first date?

"Last Day On Earth"

You made it
It's your last day on Earth
You killed someone last night
And burned down a church
Oh, you made it
For what it's worth
Well, and if it all goes wrong
And it looks like we'll soon be gone
Then we should all just get along
And sing a song I wrote
And it goes like this, it goes

Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo, oh yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo, oh yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You made it along
You got a problem with Peter, you got a problem with John
You can't go on
All this follow me shit
I want to get fucked up at home
Be naked alone
And turn up my phone
Because this song I wrote is just so fucking sick, it goes...
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Wait, I got something to say
(What's that? Oh shit)
I forgot, wait a minute
The world's about to end so I'm gonna have to finish
I guess if it were nicer, we'd be better off innit?
I haven't got a plan, so I'm think I'm gonna wing it
Naked, alone with this song I wrote and it goes like this
It goes

Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo, oh yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo, oh yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah), yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo, oh yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo, oh yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

"Cologne"

Am I seductive?
Call me back in an hour
If you wanna go back home
Oh babe, at least leave the scent of your cologne
Leave the scent of your cologne

I'm not done yet
Please kiss my neck
Let's go for another round
I hate what this song is about

Am I attractive?
Tell me, am I good enough?
Lately I've been on and off
I think I've heard too much, my wrists are numb
Heard too much, my limbs are numb

I'm not done yet
Please kiss my neck
Let's go for another round
I hate what this song is about

You're in my head
You're in my head
Fuck

I'm so attractive
Think I'm going to explode
Baby, I've been hung around
Won't you just drop your shit and pick up the phone?
Drop your shit and pick up the phone

I'm not done yet
Please kiss my neck
Let's go for another round
I hate what this song is about

"Animal Noises"

I'm still afraid of the dark
But mornings are scarier
'Cause when I'm awake, I spend half of my day
Wondering what to do
I'll miss the 9 a.m train
'Cause I slept through my alarm again
Forgetting to eat is affecting my sleep
But I guess that's just part of the trend

I miss the mornings I spent making animal noises with you
I just need someone to hold but I guess that I'm getting too old
It's something I keep getting told
I guess that I'm getting too old for this

Well, I guess that I've made some mistakes
And you know that I've told a few lies
If I call in the morning, I know you'd be boring
And say my behavior's alright
Maybe you like my mistakes
And maybe I get what I like
Maybe the things that made you wanna live
Were the things that made me wanna die

I miss the mornings I spent making animal noises with you
I just need someone to hold but I guess that I'm getting too old
It's something I keep getting told
I guess that I'm getting too old for this

For this
I'm too old for this
For this
Ah, ah, ah

I miss the mornings I spent making animal noises with you
I just need someone to hold but I guess that I'm getting too old
It's something I keep getting told
I guess that I'm getting too old for this

"He Gets Me So High"

He pretends, he is my closest friend
It's a lie, when he cries
We'll uncloak his disguise
He's a kick on my side
And I wish that I'm your ride

He gets me so high
He gets me so high
He gets me so high
I can stay in bed
But he can't stay in my head
He gets me so high

He gets fed and lives under my bed
It's been said, that it's all just in my head
(Are you feeling alive?)
I'll come back when I meet you
(Just pretend I'll be fine)
I need to know that I want you
(You need reflecting of mind)
When you know that I
I always end up coming back to you

He gets me so high
He gets me so high
He gets me so high
I can stay in bed
But he can't stay in my head
He gets me so high

I'm so high (So high)
I'm so high
I'm so high (So high)
I'm so high (So high)
I'm so high (So high)
So high

He gets me so high

"Beatopia Cultsong"

Is it me or recently time is moving slowly?
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly?
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly?
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly?
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly?
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly?
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly?
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly?

"10:36"

You don't need me
As much as I need you
As much as I need you
Take it or leave it
'Cause you know that's the truth
'Cause you know that's the truth

I know you thought it was just us
I didn't think you'd fall in love
You're just a warm body to hold
At night when I'm feeling all alone

I don't want to, yeah, yeah (I didn't mean that, that thing I said last night, it was)
I don't want to, yeah, yeah (I don't know what happened)
I don't want to, yeah, yeah (I have this thing where I, I can't really be by myself)
I don't want to, yeah, yeah (But look)

Called you for the last time
I need to be with you
I need to be with you
Saw you in a dream last night
You looked like a ghost
You looked like a ghost

I know you thought it was just us
I didn't think you'd fall in love
You're just a warm body to hold
At night when I'm feeling all alone
I know you thought it was just us
I didn't think you'd fall in love
You're just a warm body to hold
At night when I'm feeling all alone
I know you thought it was just us
I didn't think you'd fall in love
You're just a warm body to hold
At night when I'm feeling all alone
(You don't) I know you thought it was just us
(Need me) I didn't think you'd fall in love
(As much as I need you) You're just a warm body to hold
(As much as I need you) At night when I'm feeling all alone

I don't want to, yeah, yeah
I don't want to, yeah, yeah
I don't want to, yeah, yeah
I don't want to, yeah, yeah

"Sunny Day"

Know it's been raining, I swear, I'm not lonely
Always complaining that you never see me
Call in the morning when you wake
Maybe tomorrow, we're okay
When it's a sunny day

I'll keep you posted
I promise I'm better
With the sun we'll leave my house
I'm sorry for yesterday
You know I don't mean it
I promise I'm better
With the sun we'll leave my house
I'm sorry for yesterday

Keep me here
With your skin on mine again
While you're there
It's easy if I pretend

Don't know why I feel this way
Treating all my friends the same
Haven't had enough to do
But I'm not ignoring you
Call in the morning when you wake
Maybe tomorrow, we're okay
When it's a sunny day

I'll keep you posted
I promise I'm better
With the sun we'll leave my house
I'm sorry for yesterday
You know I don't mean it
I promise I'm better
With the sun we'll leave my house
I'm sorry for yesterday

Keep me here
With your skin on mine again
While you're there
It's easy if I pretend

"See You Soon"

I wanted to be everything you see
But I went the wrong direction
I needed some affection
And I'm not sure why but
I will see you soon
(I guess I have to take it, I'm deteriorating)
Feeling blue

It's a walk in the park
You said, "It's not that hard"
I'm feeling kinda dizzy
I don't want this to leave me
And I told you, I'll

See you soon
(I guess I have to take it, I'm deteriorating)
Feeling blue
(I try to have a meaning and it looks appealing)
I want you

I had some time away
Didn't want to go insane from this
I wanted you to know
I need time to grow and to exist
I think I needed space
Let you know I'm safe
I swear it's just a little thing

See you soon
(I guess I have to take it, I'm deteriorating)
Feeling blue
(I try to have a meaning and it looks appealing)
I want you

"Ripples"

Please don't make me hide
I've been putting up a fight
What's the use of it now?
When I get pulled down
Anyways I've been hiding my expressions
You can't blame the reflections
And the ripples on the ground
I might as well have drowned

So I'm keeping busy
Work twice as hard as you
Want you to believe me
That I can pick and choose
You said you'd let me drive your car
As long as I'm with you
Then you'd wait till we'd get far
To tell me that you'll be gone soon

Feels too late right now
I've been holding back
'Cause I'm afraid that I'm too loud
Six feet underground
I feel alone again
Stuck between the friends
I guess I'll figure my way through them
Not sure how I'd do it
But I'm sure now the people will listen
As the water glistens and I see my reflection
So much clearer

So I'm keeping busy
Work twice as hard as you
Want you to believe me
That I can pick and choose
You said you'd let me drive your car
As long as I'm with you
Then you'd wait till we'd get far
And tell me that you'll be gone soon

"The Perfect Pair"

You ought to know that
I think we're one and the same
I don't think we could help it
No, I don't think we could help it

We don't talk much
I guess 'cause nothing has changed
I'm not sure I like it
And I'm so tired of fighting

If I told you, you know how to go and break my heart in two
'Cause I will anyways
We'd end up like always
You know me, you better show me that you can say it to my face
'Cause you know we're the same
There's worse things I can take

I know you hate it
When there's nothing to say
I'm not quite sure we'd fix it
I guess we're so used to it

Wish I had noticed from the beginning
I find it hard to work out
Why we have all this now?

If I told you you know how to go and break my heart in two
'Cause I will anyways
We'd end up like always
You know me, you better show me that you can say it to my face
'Cause you know we're the same
There's worse things I can take

"Broken CD"

Don't think I'm over it
It hurt when I was seventeen
Flew by so quickly, I
Could hardly breathe

Don't think I'm over it
Like I always said I was
Like a broken CD
That plays on repeat

Don't think I'm over it
It hurt when I was seventeen
Flew by so quickly, I
Could hardly breathe

Don't think I'm over it
Like I always said I was
Like a broken CD
That plays on repeat

"Talk"

Call you up on a Tuesday
Say "What's up"
Babe it's too late
Why'd you have to be so complicated
Complicated

'Cause I'm not sure if I've seen you before
You looked familiar when I saw you
We go together like the gum on my shoes
We make out, we make out when it's too late
We go out, we go out on a Tuesday

A crowded place
Waiting for you
Am I lost why can't I find you
A silhouette that's in my head
You don't exist
You're my imagination
You don't exist
You're just a bad decision

'Cause I'm not sure if I've seen you before
You looked familiar when I saw you
We go together like the gum on my shoes
We make out, we make out when it's too late
We go out, we go out on a Tuesday

'Cause I'm not sure if I've seen you before
You looked familiar when I saw you
We go together like the gum on my shoes
We make out, we make out when it's too late
We go out, we go out on a Tuesday

"Lovesong"

I didn't think I'd ever want this yet
When we had first met in fall
Guess it's something you learn to accept
When I've been a mess it's not your fault
But I keep forgetting it's what we do

I missed the train again
I called your name
As if you'd drive it back
I swear you're in my head
Throughout the day
I can say that for a fact
Know we had better days
But to keep me sane
I guess that this is just another love song
About you
Just another love song
About you

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do

I'm running over sentences at times
I'd better quit dreaming just so I could write
Yet the words to describe you aren't so hard to find
Like a good quote from a book that I've memorised
But I keep forgetting just what to do

I missed the train again
I called your name
As if you'd drive it back
I swear you're in my head
Throughout the day
I can say that for a fact
Know we had better days
But to keep me sane
I guess that this is just another love song
About you
Just another love song
About you

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do

"Pictures Of Us"

Pictures of us
Buildings and rust

I don't know what it means to get better
Last night's emergency
Her and me

She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it all
No, I don't think I could do it
She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it all
No, I don't think I could do it

And I don't know what it means to get better
Last night's emergency
Her and me

She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it all
No, I don't think I could do it
She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it all
No, I don't think I could do it

She reminded me that God starts with a capital

"Fairy Song"

Need to drink water
Remember to pray
Eat so you're stronger
And live for the day
Speak to your brother
Check he's okay
Need to get out more
Don't smoke all day

I know you're sad 'cause someone died
But I'm not gonna sit inside and do nothing

Guess when I'm older
I'll be able to see
That when it gets colder
I care less about me
I should sleep like I promised
And brush my hair
Always be honest
And that would be fair

I know it's hard to comprehend
There's so much things we have to mend
I know you're sad 'cause someone died
But I'm not gonna sit inside and do nothing

Guess that's what you meant
We can still be friends
I'm not with you but
Make it till the end

Guess that's what you meant
We can still be friends
I'm not with you but
Make it till the end

Guess that's what you meant
We can still be friends
I'm not with you but

"Don't Get The Deal"

Tell me
How do you feel?
I've realised
You just don't get the deal

Tell me
(I wonder if the time we spend) How do you feel?
(I could have been a fireman) I've realised
(I'm thinking that I don't get the deal) You just don't get the deal

Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind
We've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now I guess we were meant to be

Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind
We've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now I guess we were meant to be

Am I caught in a daze?
The look in your eyes
Is never the same

Am I caught in a daze? (I think it's getting harder to see)
(I know that I've been losing sleep) The look in your eyes
(I don't think it's ever the same) Is never the same

Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind
We've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now I guess we were meant to be

Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind
We've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now I guess we were meant to be

I needed some time alone
To see that it hurts
You're looking for something
But I'm here to make it worse

Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind
We've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now I guess we were meant to be

Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind
We've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now I guess we were meant to be

"Tinkerbell Is Overrated"

I paint a picture on my wall the other night again
I have a feeling that I'm losing all my oldest friends
Spend a week inside I'm tired and I think they know
Way to go
Saw a spider living in my room the other day
I asked politely if I didn't mind I thought he'd stayed
A crow is on the roof, he peers inside, I think he knows
Then he goes

I can't pretend when I'm with my closest friends
'Cause Tinkerbell is super overrated

I started smoking in the mornings and stay in bed
I'm not a woman in my room I'm just a girl instead
I think the bug I saw that bit you he had always known
Way to go

By the way
I came to tell you
My hairs turned grey
And I think I grew
I'm afraid of lying in my room
I stay awake and it sees the truth

I can't pretend when I'm with my closest friends
'Cause Tinkerbell is super overrated

I was around on Sunday night
I wish I was at home where I feel nice
Now that I lay here in my bed
I wish that I went to meet you out instead

The sky looks all red
It's fine
The rose that I had planted yesterday died
It's fine
I lost the book that I read
It's mine
And when I leave my house I will regret it 'cause I

By the way
I came to tell you
My hairs turned grey
And I think I grew
I'm afraid of lying in my room
I stay awake and it sees the truth

I can't pretend when I'm with my closest friends
'Cause Tinkerbell is super overrated

"You're Here That's The Thing"

Catch the rain
Even on a sunny day
I swear I'm not excusing
I'll cross my heart to prove it
But she seems tired 'cause we've been through this

And I know you said that we're not a thing
But you're here that's the thing
And I'm not trying to give you a ring
Well maybe on the phone if you let it sing
You're overcomplicating everything
When the lights go down don't say I didn't warn ya
I don't think that's legal in the state of California

I've got you wrapped around my finger
Like a piece of ribbon
You just won't admit it that you're smitten
Hold on a minute please won't you listen
'Cause I'm not sure if you're into
Me like I'm into you
I said a lot of stupid things in the winter
Once the ice got thinner
But somehow we managed through the fall
So I guess it's not that bad at all

That we're not a thing
But you're here that's the thing
And I'm not trying to give you a ring
Well maybe on the phone if you let it sing
You're overcomplicating everything
When the lights go down don't say I didn't warn ya
I don't think that's legal in the state of California

I'm going away
Did I forget to mention how long I'd stay
Is that a question for another day
But while we're away

And I know you said that we're not a thing
But you're here that's the thing
And I'm not trying to give you a ring
Well maybe on the phone if you let it sing
You're overcomplicating everything
When the lights go down don't say I didn't warn ya
I don't think that's legal in the state of California

"A Night To Remember"

Swore I'd seen you before
Watched you walk through the door
Somethin' in your eye
Reminded me of somebody I used to know

You touch my back
I took your hand
Somethin' from your touch felt shockingly familiar
And I'd swore I'd seen you before

Oh, I swore I'd seen you before

Underneath the sheets
You enchanted me
And whispered sweet nothings in my ear
I shivered beneath you
All wrapped up in embers
It was a night to remember

Then I walked away
You asked me to stay
Now you're thinkin' of what could've been
But you've become someone I've seen before

I swore I'd seen you before

Underneath the sheets
You enchanted me
And whispered sweet nothings in my ear
I shivered beneath you
All wrapped up in embers
It was a night, enchanting night
To remember

"Coffee"

Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
And I promise that one day I'll feel fine
And I promise that one day I'll feel alright

And I'll make a cup of coffee
With the right amount of sugar
How you like it
And I'll make a cup of coffee
With the right amount of sugar
How you like it
How you like it

Don't know how long I'll stay for
It's okay, I'll knock on your door
Won't you come down and get me?
I like it when you hold me
Tight

You make me feel nice
The green in your eyes
Makes me feel warm inside

And I'll make a cup of coffee
With the right amount of sugar
How you like it
And I'll make a cup of coffee
With the right amount of sugar
How you like it
How you like it

"Get Along"
(from "Ivy + Bean" soundtrack)

Tell me the things you let me know
No need to rush we'll take it slowly
Guess, our worlds colliding
The difference in us is hard to prove
Guess I just have to get to know you
But, I'll take my time trying

Memories through photographs that makes us laugh
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?

(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)

Spending all of our time figuring what to do
Not to far there's a place just for us two
Its an endless world that's outside so I'm sticking with you
Guess it's fine in our minds there's enough to do

Memories through photographs that makes us laugh
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?

In a place not far from home
Somewhere we both go
In our way we can't relay
In the end we're just the same

I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while?

(You)
It's you

It's you

It's you

It's you

It's you

"Glue Song"

I've never known someone like you
Tangled in love, stuck by you
From the glue
Don't forget to kiss me
Or else you'll have to miss me
I guess I'm stuck forever by the glue
Oh, and you

Finding the right words
To use for this song
I have you in mind
So it won't take so long
Never thought I'd find you
But you're here
And so I love you

I'm not wrong
When I say I've been stuck
By the glue onto you
I've been stuck by glue
Right onto you
I've been stuck by glue

I've never known
I've never known someone like you
I've never known
I've never known someone like you

"Glue Song (Remix)"
(feat. Clairo)

I've never known someone like you
Tangled in love, stuck by you
From the glue
Don't forget to kiss me
Or else you'll have to miss me
I guess I'm stuck forever by the glue
Oh, and you

You've been hiding in plain sight
And it appeared, oh I know
Loving you once only feels wrong
I need you
I always knew I'd find you
To be here is worth the wait to
I'm not lying
When I say I've been stuck
By the glue onto you

I've been stuck by glue
Right onto you
I've been stuck by glue

I've never known
I've never known someone like you
I've never known
I've never known someone like you

"iScream"

I'm not who I like
I'll fight you till I'm right
I'm right, you're wrong
In my mind I scream this song

Corbyn, my best friend
Taught me everything I know in my head, and he's
Braindead in the tool shed
Didn't hear a single word you said

I must apologize
Say it one more time mister magpie
Goodbye cool guy
Laugh again, you're gonna get a bruised eye
What's your problem
With me?
Something's gone wrong
What the hell is happening?

I bleed, I scream
Ice cream's under my jeans
What the world doesn't get is I'm me
In my rocky beep beep
I'm not who I like
I'll fight you till I'm right
I'm right, you're wrong
In my mind I scream this song

This could be forever
Is that too much to ask?
We'll try and make it last
One day more
We could be together
Hang out in the day
But then you'll eat my brain
So whatever

In my jeans
This ice cream is for everyone
And I want you to be the one
In my dreams
I run around the world sometime
Then I'll take you back to mine

I bleed, I scream
Ice cream's under my jeans
What the world doesn't get is I'm me
In my rocky beep beep
I'm not who I like
I'll fight you till I'm right
I'm right, you're wrong
In my mind I scream this song

In my rocky beep beep

I'm vindicated
You're saturated
Will you stop taking it?
Just a wannabe, beep beep
I dream this dream
I can't explain it
And I just shave my head
Goodbye honeybee, beep beep

I bleed, I scream
Ice cream's under my jeans
What the world doesn't get is I'm me
In my rocky beep beep
I'm not who I like
I'll fight you till I'm right
I'm right, you're wrong
In my mind I scream this song

What's your problem with me?
I'm right, you're wrong
In my mind I scream this song

"Silver Into Rain"

Someday I'll be caught up in the wind
Maybe I'll spill it out my skin
And the earth will take me down
One day I'll no longer have my bed
And I'll forget the things you said
On a rainy week in June

Blowing away, I'm sipping on rosÃ©
Turning gold into grey and the silver into rain
Blow me away, I'm too young for my age
Too shy for the stage, too careful to be brave

Oh
Getting hard to see things straight
It's not too late
Oh
Getting hard to see things straight
It's not too late

Blowing away, I'm sipping on rosÃ©
Turning gold into grey and the silver into rain
Blowing away, I'm sipping on rosÃ©
Gold into grey and the silver into rain

I'm blowing away, I'm sipping on rosÃ©
Gold into grey and the silver into rain
Blowing away, I'm sipping on rosÃ©
Turning gold into grey and the silver

I'm too young for my age

"Susie May"

Susie May goes out at night
Thinking of all the things she likes
She can't afford to throw those things away
Susie May forgets she's not okay

And does she know
It's not fine that she cries at night?
And does she know
It's not alright that she hates to fly?
Susie May, you're not okay
Time to find your way

And I'm alright, don't you see?
Always tangled in bedsheets
You can see it in my eyes, always
1 AM with swollen eyes

And does she know
It's not fine that she cries at night?
And does she know
It's not alright that she hates to fly?
Susie May, you're not okay
Time to find your way

And I'm alright, don't you see?
Always tangled in bedsheets
You can see it in my eyes, always
1 AM with swollen eyes

"The Moon Song"
(feat. Pig)

I'm lyin' on the moon
My dear, I'll be there soon
It's a quiet, starry place
Time's were swallowed up
In space, we're here, a million miles away

There's things I wish I knew
There's no thing I'd keep from you
It's a dark and shiny place
But with you, my dear
I'm safe and we're a million miles away

We're lyin' on the moon
It's a perfect afternoon
Your shadow follows me all day
Making sure that I'm okay
And we're a million miles away

"the way things go"

And there's so much left to say
I guess I'm just the bigger guy
And there's too much on my mind
That I don't even want to try
Guess it's not far from the ordinary
They do say love is blind
But I guess that's the way things go

Can't remember how to say your name
Let alone count all the freckles on your face
A distant memory I used to know
Oh I guess that's just the way things go
Oh I guess that's just the way things go

Can't remember when you said you called
Miles away and it was still my fault
The love you said you had, it sometimes showed
Oh I guess that's just the way things go
Oh I guess that's just the way things go

There's so much left to say
I guess I'm just the bigger guy
And there's too much on my mind
That I don't even want to try
Guess it's not far from the ordinary
They do say love is blind
But I guess that's the way things go

Didn't think you'd ever stoop so low
Getting with the only girl you know
A lousy route that only makes me say
That's pretty lame and that's the way things go
Oh I guess that's just the way things go

Passed your house when I was on a train
In my mind you'll always stay the same
I'm happy now, I ought to let you know
But I guess that's just the way things go
Oh I guess that's just the way things go

And I don't mind that that's the way things go
And I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, I don't mind
Oh I guess that's just the way things go
Oh I guess that's the way things go
