"Bravado"

All my life
I've been fighting a war
I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you
My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to
This will not do

'Cause I was raised up
To be admired to be noticed
But when you're withdrawn it's the closest thing
To assault when all eyes are on you
This will not do

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm faking glory
Lick my lips toss my hair
And turn the smile on
And the story's brand-new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado

It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipsed, whoa
And I can tell you that when the lights come on I'll be ready for this

It's in your bloodstream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scale without thinking of size

I was frightened of every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me

But I learnt not to want
The quiet of the room with no one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval, the things that make me go

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipsed, whoa
And I can tell you that when the lights come on I'll be ready for this

It's in your blood stream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scale without thinking of size

I was frightened of every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me

But I learnt not to want
The quiet of the room with no one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval, the things that make me go

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

"Royals"

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
We didn't come from money

But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

Ooh ooh oh
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen
Ooh ooh oh
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

"Million Dollar Bills"

There's nothing I want
But money and time
Million dollar bills
And the tick-tick-tick-tick
There's nothing more cruel
Than only nine lives
Unlimited spines
Would do the trick-trick-trick-trick

We could leave the house, leave the party, let the people know
Go drown the colours of our minds and watch the cars go

There's nothing as fun
As coming untied
And running with the kids
In the park-park-park-park
There's nothing that's hurt
Like letting you go
It's like a bird
Eyes
In the dark-dark-dark-dark

We could leave the house, lead the party, let the people know
Go drown the colours of our minds and watch the cars go
It's not about just bein' out with the right people
'Cause we can get in trouble just by going free-flow

And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know

"The Love Club"

I'm in a clique but I want out
It's not the same as when I was punched
In the old days, there was enough
The card games and knees with the bitter salt of blood
I was in, but I want out
My mother's love is choking me
I'm sick of words that hang above my head
"What about the kid?" It's time the kid got free

Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

I joined the club and it's all on
There are fights for being my best friend
And the girls get their claws out
There's something about hanging out with the wicked kids
Take the pill, make it too real
The other day I forgot my old address
I'm sitting pretty on the throne
There's nothing more I want
Except to be alone

Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

(For the love club)
(For the love club)
(For the love club)

Your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go
So drop your chin and take yourself back home
And roll out your maps and papers
Find out your hiding places again
The only problem that I got with the club
Is how you're severed from the people
Who watched you grow up
When you're a member
Go on your great adventure again
And we'll be waiting at the end

Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

(For the love club)
(For the love club)
(For the love club)
(For the love club)

"Biting Down"

It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down

Skip a hit, don't make a sound
(It feels better biting down)
Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown
(It feels better biting down)
Listen to the beats resound
(It feels better biting down)
It feels better biting down
(It feels better biting down)

It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down

Skip a hit, don't make a sound
(It feels better biting down)
Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown
(It feels better biting down)
Listen to the beats resound
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down

The electronics of your heart
See how fast they fall apart
(It feels better biting down)
The electronics of your heart
See how fast they fall apart
(It feels better biting down)
It feels better biting down

Skip a hit, don't make a sound
(It feels better biting down)

And I can tell you that
When the lights come on, I'll be ready for this
It's in your bloodstream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes

Or a mountain you scaled without thinking of size

I was frightened of

"Tennis Court"

Don't you think that it's boring how people talk
Making smart with their words again, well I'm bored
Because I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
Never not chasing a million things I want
And I am only as young as the minute is full of it
Getting pumped up on the little bright things I bought
But I know they'll never own me
(Yeah)

Baby be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah)

Pretty soon I'll be getting on my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
But my head's filling up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again, when I'm known
And my boys trip me up with their heads again, loving them
Everything's cool when we're all in line for the throne
But I know it's not forever
(Yeah)

Baby be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah)

It looked alright in the pictures (yeah)

Getting caught's half of the trip though, isn't it?
I fall apart with all my heart (yeah)
And you could watch from your window (yeah)
[Laughs]
And you can watch from your window

Baby be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah)

And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah
(Yeah)

"400 Lux"

We're never done with killing time
Can I kill it with you
'Til the veins run red and blue?
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do
Let me kill it with you

You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow, but we're brave

And I like you
I love these roads where the houses don't change (and I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say (and I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway (and I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed

Now we're wearing long sleeves and the heating comes on
(You buy me orange juice)
We're getting good at this
Dreams of clean teeth
I can tell that you're tired
But you keep the car on
While you're waiting out front

You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow, but we're brave

And I like you
I love these roads where the houses don't change (and I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say (and I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway (and I like you)

"Royals"

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
We didn't come from money

And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule

Ooh ooh oh
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen
Ooh ooh oh
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz

"Ribs"

The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy getting old

We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good, how you wish it would be all the time

The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy getting old

The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy getting old

This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary getting old

We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good, how you wish it would be all the time

This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
Feels so scary getting old

This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
Feels so scary getting old

I want them back (I want them back)
The minds we had (the minds we had)
How all the thoughts (how all the thoughts)
Moved 'round our heads (moved 'round our heads)

I want them back (I want them back)
The minds we had (the minds we had)
It's not enough to feel the lack (I want them back, I want them back)
I want 'em

You're the only friend I need (you're the only friend I need)
Sharing beds like little kids (sharing beds like little kids)
And laughing 'til our ribs get tough (and laughing 'til our ribs get tough)
But that will never be enough (but that will never be enough)

You're the only friend I need (you're the only friend I need)
Sharing beds like little kids (sharing beds like little kids)
And laughing 'til our ribs get tough (and laughing 'til our ribs get tough)
But that will never be enough (but that will never be enough)

That will never be enough

"Buzzcut Season"

I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
(I remember when your head caught flame)
Well, you laughed, baby, it's OK
It's buzzcut season, anyway
(Well, you laughed, baby, it's OK)

Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good

We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
People should see how we're living
(We ride the bus with the knees pulled in)
Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays)

The men up on the news
They try to tell us all that we will lose
But it's so easy in this blue
Where everything is good

And I'll never go home again
(Place the call, feel it start)
Favorite friend
(And nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
We're all the things that we do for fun
(And I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along
(Make-believe, it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you

Cola with the burnt-out taste
I'm the one you tell your fears to
There'll never be enough of us

Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good

And I'll never go home again
(Place the call, feel it start)
Favorite friend
(And nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
We're all the things that we do for fun
(And I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along
(Make-believe, it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you

"Team"

Wait till you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon Your Greatness and she'll
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out

Call all the ladies out
They're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother
While he glows through the room

Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes, as well
Even the comatose
They don't dance and tell

We live in cities you'll never see on-screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there

So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet
But it wasn't my fault
And everyone's competing
For a love they won't receive
'Cause what this palace wants is release

We live in cities you'll never see on-screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
I'm kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care
So there

We live in cities you'll never see on-screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

We're on each other's team
And you know, we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know, and you know, and you know

"Glory And Gore"

There's a humming in the restless summer air
And we're slipping off the course that we prepared
But in all chaos, there is calculation
Dropping glasses just to hear them break
You've been drinking like the world was gonna end (it didn't)
Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (go figure)
It's clear that someone's gotta go
We mean it but I promise we're not mean

And the cry goes out
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out 
Now we're in the ring
And we're coming for blood

(Oh! Oh!)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But we're the gladiators (Oh! Oh!)
Everyone a rager (oh-oh)
But secretly they're saviors
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines (Oh! Oh!)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But victory's contagious

Delicate in every way but one (the swordplay)
God knows we like archaic kinds of fun (the old way)
Chance is the only game I play with, baby
We let our battles choose us

And the cry goes out
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out 
Now we're in the ring
And we're coming for blood

(Oh! Oh!)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But we're the gladiators (Oh! Oh!)
Everyone a rager (oh-oh)
But secretly they're saviors
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines (Oh! Oh!)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But victory's contagious

No-one round here's good at keeping their eyes closed
The sun's starting to light up when we're walking home
Tired little laughs, gold-lie promises: we'll always win at this
I don't ever think about death
It's alright if you do, it's fine
We gladiate but I guess we're really fighting ourselves
Roughing up our minds so we're ready when the kill time comes
Wide awake in bed, words in my brain, 
"Secretly you love this do you even wanna go free?"
Let me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means

(Oh! Oh!)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But we're the gladiators (Oh! Oh!)
Everyone a rager (oh-oh)
But secretly they're saviors
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines (Oh! Oh!)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But victory's contagious

"Still Sane"

Today is my birthday, and I'm riding high
Hair is dripping, hiding that I'm terrified
But this is summer, playing dumber than in fall

Everything I say falls right back
Into everything I'm not
In the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet

Riding around on the bikes, we're still sane
I won't be her, tripping over on-stage
Hey, it's all cool, I still like hotels, but I think that'll change
Still like hotels, and my newfound fame
Hey, promise I can stay good

(Everything feels right)
I'm little, but I'm coming for the crown
I'm little, but I'm coming for you
(Chase paper, get by)
I'm little but I'm coming for the title
Held by everyone who's up

All work and no play
Never made me lose it
All business all day
Keeps me up a level
All work and no play
Keeps me on the new shit, yeah

All work and no play
Let me count the bruises
All business all day
Keeps me up a level
All work and no play
Lonely on that new shit, yeah, yeah

Only bad people live to see their likeness set in stone
Only bad people live to see their likeness set in stone
What does that make me?

I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet

I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet

All work and no play
Never made me lose it
All business all day
Keeps me up a level

All work and no play
Keeps me on the new shit, yeah

"White Teeth Teens"

We wouldn't be seen dead here in the day
I guess you're lucky that it's dark now
And if I like it then we'll stay
Impress the empress, take a shot now

We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are up for it

I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this

If you want we'll help tonight to split its seams
Give the bruises out like gifts
You'll get the picture of your dreams
I won't be smiling
But the notes from my admirers
Fill the dashboard just the same

We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are up for it

I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop us when we're up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this

[Repeat in background:]
And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could

I'll let you in on something big
I am not a white teeth teen
I tried to join but never did
The way they are, the way they seem is something else, it's in the blood
Their molars blinking like the lights, in the underpass where we all sit
And do nothing
And love it

[Repeat in background:]
And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could

We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are out

"A World Alone"

That slow burn wait while it gets dark, bruising the sun
I feel grown up with you in your car, I know it's dumb

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

We've both got a million bad habits to kick, not sleeping is one
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip, I'm biting my tongue

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
People are talking, people are talking (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
People are talking, people are talking

Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone, world alone, we're alone

All my fake friends and all of their noise, complain about work
They're studying business, I study the floor, and you haven't stopped smoking all night
Maybe the Internet raised us, or maybe people are jerks
(People are talking, people are talking)
But not you
(People are talking, people are talking)

Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone, world alone, we're alone

All the double-edged people and schemes
They make a mess then go home and get clean
You're my best friend, and we're dancing in a world alone, a world alone, we're alone

I know we're not everlasting
We're a train wreck waiting to happen
One day the blood won't flow so gladly
One day we'll all get still
(People are talking, people are talking)
(People are talking, people are talking)
Get still
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
People are talking, people are talking (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
People are talking, people are talking
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
People are talking, people are talking (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
People are talking, people are talking

Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone, world alone, we're alone

All the double-edged people and schemes
They make a mess then go home and get clean
You're my best friend and we're dancing in a world alone, a world alone, we're alone

People are talking, people are talking
People are talking, people are talking
People are talking, people are talking
People are talking, people are talking

Let 'em talk

"Green Light"

I do my make-up in somebody else's car
We order different drinks at the same bars
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar
(Liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar)

Well, those great whites, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love, no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light-up floor?
On the light-up floor

But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But, honey, I'll be seein' you 'ever I go
But, honey, I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

'Cause, honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

Sometimes I wake up in a different bedroom
I whisper things, the city sings them back to you

Well, those rumours, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love, no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light-up floor?
On the light-up floor

But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But, honey, I'll be seein' you 'ever I go
But, honey, I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

'Cause, honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

Yeah, honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

"Sober"

Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
(When you get to my high, when you get to my)
Night, midnight

Oh, God, I'm clean out of air in my lungs
It's all gone
Played it so nonchalant
It's time we danced with the truth
Move alone with the truth
Ooh (hey)
We're sleeping through all the days
I'm acting like I don't see
Every ribbon you used to tie yourself to me

But my hips have missed your hips
So, let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me?
(Ah ha)

We're King and Queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care
But we care
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)

Oh, God, I'm closing my teeth
Around this liquor-wet lime
Midnight, lose my mind
I know you're feeling it too
Can we keep up with the ruse?
Ah ah (hey)
B-bodies all through my house
I know this story by heart:
Jack and Jill get fucked up and possessive
When it get dark

But my hips have missed your hips
So, let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me?
Go astray with me?
(Ah ha)

We're King and Queen of the Weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care
But we care
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober?)

Midnight, we're fading
'Til daylight, we're jaded
We know that it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with all the heartache
And the treason, the fantasies of leaving
But we know that, when it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with us
(Midnight, lose my mind, midnight, lose my mind)
Oh, dancing with us
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Oh, you'll be dancing with us
(Can you feel it? Can you feel it?)
Dancing with us, us
(But what will we do when we're sober?)
Us

When you get to my high (midnight, lose my mind)
When you get to my (midnight, lose my mind)

"Homemade Dynamite"

A couple rebel Top Gun pilots
Flying with nowhere to be
Don't know you super well
But I think that you might be the same as me
Behave abnormally

Let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side
Tell you all my best lies
Yeah, awesome right?
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side
Tell you all my best lies
Seeing me rolling, showing someone else love
Dancing with our shoes off
Know I think you're awesome, right?

Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

Might get your friend to drive
But he can hardly see
We'll end up painted on the road
Red and chrome, all the broken glass sparkling
I guess we're partying

So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side
Tell you all my best lies
See me rolling, showing someone else love
Hands under your T-shirt
Know I think you're awesome, right?

Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

Now you know it's really gonna blow (boo)

Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired

"The Louvre"

Well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
Our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
Half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard
I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough
I overthink your p-punctuation use
Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do

A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame
All that you're doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

Our thing progresses, I call and you come through
Blow all my friendships to sit in hell with you
But we're the greatest, they'll hang us in the Louvre
Down the back, but who cares? Still the Louvre
Okay, I know that you are not my type (Still I fall)
I'm just the sucker who let you fill her mind (But what about love?)
Nothing wrong with it, supernatural
Just move in close to me, closer, you'll feel it coasting

A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame
All that you're doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

"Liability"

Go for it
One, two

Baby really hurt me
Crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please
But she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands
Play at romance, we slow dance
In the living room, but all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone
Stroking her cheek

They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for
E-a-na-na-na, everyone

The truth is I am a toy
That people enjoy
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting
Running through the night, but
Every perfect summer's
Eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own

They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for
E-a-na-na-na, everyone

They're gonna watch me
Disappear into the sun
You're all gonna watch me
Disappear into the sun

"Hard Feelings / Loveless"

[Hard Feelings]

Go back and tell it

Please, could you be tender?
And I will sit close to you
Let's give it a minute before we admit that we're through
Guess this is the winter
Our bodies are young and blue
I'm at Jungle City, it's late and this song is for you

'Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us
Before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
Now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
Well, I guess I should go, yeah, I guess I should go

Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When sweet words and fevers
All leave us right here in the cold, oh, oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God, I wish I believed ya
When you told me this was my home, oh, oh

I light all the candles
Cut flowers for all my rooms
I care for myself the way I used to care about you
These days, we kiss and we keep busy
The waves come after midnight
I call from underwater
Why even try to get right?
When you've outgrown a lover (Oh)
The whole world knows but you (Oh)
It's time to let go of this endless summer afternoon

Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When sweet words and fevers
All leave us right here in the cold, oh, oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God, I wish I believed ya
When you told me this was my home, oh, oh

Three years, loved you every single day
Made me weak, it was real for me, yeah, real for me
Now I'll fake it every single day
'Til I don't need fantasy, 'til I feel you leave
But I still remember everything
How we'd drift buying groceries, how you'd dance for me
I'll start letting go of little things
'Til I'm so far away from you, far away from you, yeah

[Loveless]

"What is this tape?"
"This is my favorite tape"

Bet you wanna rip my heart out
Bet you wanna skip my calls now
Well, guess what? I'd like that
'Cause I'm gonna mess your life up
Gonna wanna tape my mouth shut
Look out, lovers

"Sober II (Melodrama)"

You asked if I was feeling it, I'm psycho high
Know you won't remember in the morning when I speak my mind
Lights are on and they've gone home, but who am I?
Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses
We told you this was melodrama
(Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)
Our only wish is melodrama
(Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)

And the terror and the horror
When we wonder why we bother, whoa, whoa
And the terror and the horror
God, I wonder why we bother, whoa, whoa
All the glamour and the trauma
And the fuckin' melodrama, whoa, whoa
All the gun fights and the lime lights
And the holy sick divine nights, whoa
(Holy sick divine nights, whoa)
They'll talk about us, all the lovers
How we kiss and kill each other, whoa
They'll talk about us, and discover
How we kissed and killed each other, whoa
(And we'll tell them)

We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offer
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offer
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offer
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offer

We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama

"Writer In The Dark"

Break the newsâyou're walking out
To be a good man for someone else
Sorry I was never good like you
Stood on my chest and kept me down
Hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
Did my best to exist just for you

Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe

I still feel you, now and then
Slow like pseudo-ephedrine
When you see me, will you say I've changed?
I ride the subway, read the signs
I let the seasons change my mind
I love it here since I've stopped needing you

Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe

I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe

"Supercut"

In my head
I play a supercut of us
All the magic we gave off
All the love we had and lost
And in my head
The visions never stop
These ribbons wrap me up
But when I reach for you
There's just a supercut

In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
We keep trying to talk about us
I'm someone you maybe might love
I'll be your quiet afternoon crush
Be your violent overnight rush
Make you crazy over my touch

But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh, it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us

So I fall
Into continents and cars
All the stages and the stars
I turn all of it
To just a supercut

'Cause in my head (In my head, I do everything right)
When you call (When you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours are the moments I play in the dark
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh

In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
We keep trying to talk about us
Slow motion, I'm watching our love
I'll be your quiet afternoon crush
Be your violent overnight rush
Make you crazy over my touch

But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh, it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh, it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us

'Cause in my head, in my head, I do everything right
When you call, I'll forgive and not fight
All the moments I play in the dark
Wild, fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh
'Cause in my head (In my head, I do everything right)
When you call (When you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours are the moments I play in the dark
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh
'Cause in my head (In my head, I do everything right)
When you call (When you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours are the moments I play in the dark
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh

In my head, I do everything right
In my head, I do everything right

"Liability (Reprise)"

I'm a liability, I'm a liability
Much for me
You're a little much for me, no, no, no, no
And what ya gonna do? Whoa

All of the dreams that get harder
All of the things that I offer you, ay
And all of the shit that we harbour
Make all of the kids in the choirs sing, "Woo-hoo"
And maybe all this is the party
Maybe the tears and the highs we breathe, oh no
And maybe all this is the party
Maybe we just do it violently

But you're not what you thought you were
But you're not what you thought you were
(Liability) But you're not what you thought you were
(Much for me) But you're not what you thought you were
Leave

"Perfect Places"

Every night, I live and die
Feel the party to my bones
Watch the wasters blow the speakers
Spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
It's just another graceless night
I hate the headlines and the weather
I'm 19 and I'm on fire
But when we're dancing, I'm alright
It's just another graceless night

Are you lost enough?
Have another drink, get lost in us
This is how we get notorious, oh
'Cause I don't know
If they keep tellin' me where to go
I'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh-oh-oh

Ch, ch

All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places

Every night, I live and die
Meet somebody, take 'em home
Let's kiss and then take off our clothes
It's just another graceless night

'Cause all of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places

All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places, anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places, anyway?
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places, anyway?

"The Path"

Born in the year of OxyContin
Raised in the tall grass
Teen millionaire having nightmares from the camera flash
Now I'm alone on a windswept island
Caught in the complex divorce of the seasons
Won't take the call if it's the label or the radio
Ahh
Ahh

Arm in a cast at the museum gala
Fork in my purse to take home to my mother
Supermodels all dancing 'round a pharaoh's tomb

Now if you're looking for a savior, well that's not me
You need someone to take your pain for you?
Well, that's not me
'Cause we're all broken and sad
Where are the dreams that we had?
Can't find the dreams that we had
Ah, ah, ah
Let's hope the sun will show us the path
Let's hope the sun will show us the path
Ah, ah, ah
I just hope the sun will show us the path
Savior is not me
I just hope the sun will show us the path
Savior is not me
I just hope the sun will show us the path
Path, path

"Solar Power"

I hate the winter
Can't stand the cold
I tend to cancel all the plans
(So sorry, I can't make it)
But when the heat comes
Something takes a hold
Can I kick it?
Yeah, I can

My cheeks in high color, overripe peaches
No shirt, no shoes, only my features
My boy behind me, he's taking pictures
Lead the boys and girls onto the beaches
Come one, come all, I'll tell you my secrets
I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus

Forget all of the tears
That you've cried
It's over (Over)
(Over, over, over)
It's a new state of mind
Are you coming, my baby?

Acid green
Aquamarine
The girls are dancing
In the sand
And I throw my cellular device
In the water
Can you reach me?
No, you can't (Aha)

My cheeks in high color, overripe peaches
No shirt, no shoes, only my features
My boy behind me, he's taking pictures
(He's taking pictures)
Lead the boys and girls onto the beaches
Come one, come all, I'll tell you my secrets
I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus

Turn it on
In a new kind of bright
It's solar (Solar)
(Solar, solar, solar)
Come on and let the bliss begin
Blink three times when you feel it kickin' in

That solar-olar
Olar power
Solar-olar
Olar power
Solar-olar
Olar power
Solar-olar
Olar power
Solar-olar
Olar power
Solar-olar
Olar power

"California"

Once upon a time in Hollywood when Carole called my name
I stood up, the room exploded and I knew that's it, I'll never be the same
That's when the doors swung open and a voice said, "We're glad you came"
Now I've spent thousands on you darling, all the hotels and the jets
And I'd pay it all again to have your golden body back in my bed
But I don't miss the poison arrows aimed directly at my head

Goodbye to all the bottles
All the models
Bye to the clouds in the skies that all hold no rain-
(Don't want that California love)
(Don't want that California love)
(Don't want that California love)

Once upon a time the Canyon Store was where my world began
All that mystery and beauty gleaned from desert flowers and gifted children
But it got hard to grow up with your cool hand around my neck
Now in my hometown, sunbathing
My girlfriends, and my baby
But every time I smell tequila, the garden grows up in my mind again

Goodbye to all the bottles
All the models
Bye to the kids in the lines for the new Supreme-
(Don't want that California love)
(Don't want that California love)
(Don't want that California love)
(Don't want that California love)
(Don't want that California love)
(Don't want that California love)

It's just a dream
It's just a dream
It's all just a dream
I wanna wake up, I wanna wake up

"Stoned At The Nail Salon"

Got a wishbone drying on the windowsill in my kitchen
Just in case I wake up and realise I've chosen wrong
I love this life that I have
The vine hanging over the door
And the dog who comes when I call
But I wonder sometimes what I'm missing

Well, my hot blood's been burning for so many summers now
It's time to cool it down
Wherever that leads

'Cause all the beautiful girls, they will fade like the roses
And all the times, they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again

Got a memory of waiting in your bed wearing only my earrings
We'd go dancing all over the landmines under our town
But the sun has to rise
When it does, we'll divide up the papers
Two former hell-raisers
I'm still crazy for you, babe

Well, my hot blood's been burning for so many summers now
It's time to cool it down
Wherever that leads

'Cause all the music you loved at sixteen, you'll grow out of
And all the times, they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybe I'm just
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again

Oh, make it good
Oh, make it good
I'd ride and I'd ride on the carousel
'Round and 'round forever if I could
But it's time to cool it down
Whatever that means

Spend all the evenings you can with the people who raised you
'Cause all the times they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again

"Fallen Fruit"

To the ones who came before us
All the golden ones who were lifted on a wing
We had no idea the dreams we had were far too big
Far too big

And we will walk together (We will walk)
Psychedelic garlands in our hair
Through the halls of splendour where the apple trees all grew
You'll leave us dancing on the fallen fruit
(The fallen fruit)
The fallen fruit (Ooh)
(The fallen fruit)

From the Nissan to the Phantom to the plane
We'll disappear in the cover of the rain
Took the great minds and the vapers
And a pocketful of seed
It's time for us to leave

And we will walk together (We will walk)
Psychedelic garlands in our hair
But how can I love what I know I am gonna lose?
Don't make me choose

(The fallen fruit)
(The fallen fruit)
(The fallen fruit)

"Secrets From A Girl (Who's Seen It All)"

Dancing with my girls, only having two drinks then leaving
It's a funny thing, thought you'd never gain self-control
Guess it's been a while since you last said sorry
Crying in the dark at your best friends' parties
You've had enough, gotta turn the lights up, go home

Couldn't wait to turn fifteen
Then you blink and it's been ten years
Growing up a little at a time then all at once
Everybody wants the best for you
But you gotta want it for yourself
My love

You can take 'em if you want 'em, these are just
Secrets from a girl, who's seen it all
Secrets from a girl, who's seen it
Secrets from a girl
Secrets from a girl, who's seen it
Secrets from a girl (Secrets from a girl)
Secrets from a girl, who's seen it all

'Member all the hurt you would feel when you weren't desired?
(Doing anything for more touch)
'Member what you thought was grief before you got the call?
Baby girl, no one's gonna feel the pain for you
You're gonna love again, so just try staying open
And when the time comes, you'll fall
Yeah, when the time comes, you'll fall

Your dreams and inner visions, all your mystical ambitions
They won't let you down
Do your best to trust all the rays of light
Everybody wants the best for you
But you gotta want it for yourself
My love

Couldn't wait to turn fifteen, then you just go
(Whoosh)

Welcome to Sadness
The temperature is unbearable until you face it
Thank you for flying with Strange Airlines
I will be your tour guide today
Your emotional baggage can be picked up at Carousel Number 2
Please be careful so that it doesn't fall onto someone you love
When we've reached your final destination, I will leave you to it
You'll be fine
I'm just gonna show you in, and um you can stay as long as you need to get familiar with the feeling
And then when you're ready, I'll be outside, and we can go look at the sunrise by euphoria mixed with existential vertigo?
Cool

"The Man With The Axe"

If I had to break it down, I'd say it's the way you love to dance
Moving the furniture when my back is turned
The flick of the lights and the world falls away
And your office job, and your silver hair
But our shapes in the dark are the reason I've stayed for all these years

I thought I was a genius
But now I'm twenty-two
And it's starting to feel like all I know how to do is
Put on a suit and take it away
With my fistful of tunes that it's painful to play
Fingernail worlds, like favourite seashells
They fill up my nights and then they float away

I've got hundreds of gowns, I've got paintings in frames
And a throat that fills with panic every festival day
Dutifully falling apart for the Princess of Norway

But you with your doll's lashes, your infinite T-shirts
I should've known when your favourite record was the same as my father's you'd take me down

I guess I'll always be this way
Swallowed up by the words and halfway to space
But there by the fire, you offered your hand
And as I took it, I loved you, the boy with the plan

You felled me clean as a pine
The man with the axe
And the look in his eyes

We've been through so many hard times, I'm writing a love song
For you, baby

"Dominoes"

I heard that you were doing yoga
With Uma Thurman's mother
Just outside of Woodstock
Now you're watering all the flowers
You planted with your new girlfriend
Outside on the rooftop

Just another phase you're rushing on through
Go all New Age, outrunning your blues

Fifty gleaming chances in a row
Then I watch you flick them down like dominoes
Must feel good being Mr. Start-Again

I know
Know a girl who knows a
Another girl who knows the woman that you hurt
It's strange to see you smoking marijuana
You used to do the most cocaine
Of anyone I'd ever met

Just another phase you're shooting on through
The whole world changes right around you
You get fifty gleaming chances in a row
And I watch you flick them down like dominoes
Must feel good being Mr. Start-Again
Yeah, it must feel good being Mr. Start-Again
Don't get up
Yeah, it must feel good being Mr. Start-Again

"Big Star"

Everyone knows that you're too good for me, don't they?
I'm a cheater, I lie, and I'm shy
But you like to say hello to total strangers
Shivering pines and walls of colour
I can't believe I used to stay inside

But every perfect summer's gotta say goodnight
Now I watch you run through the amber light
I used to love the party, now I'm not alright
Drinking in the dark, take me home tonight

Baby, you're a big star
You're a big star
Wanna take your picture

I toss up if it's worth it now every time I get on a plane
I've got so much to tell you and not enough time to do it in

But every perfect summer's gotta take its flight
I'll still watch you run through the winter light
I used to love the party, now I'm not alright
Hope the honeybees make it home tonight

Baby, you're a big star
You're a big star
Wanna take your picture

'Til I die
'Til I die
'Til I die

"Leader Of A New Regime"

Wearing SPF 3000 for the ultraviolet rays
Made it to the island on the last of the outbound planes (Ah-ah)
Got a trunk full of Simone and CÃ©line, and of course, my magazines
I'm gonna live out my days

Won't somebody, anybody, be the leader of a new regime?
Free the keepers of the burnt-out scene another day
Lust and paranoia reign supreme
We need the leader of a new regime

"Mood Ring"

I'm tryna blow bubbles, but inside
Can't seem to fix my mood
Today it's as dark as my roots
If I, if I ever let them grow out (Ah-ah)
Now all of my oceans have riptides
Can't seem to find what's wrong
The whole world is letting me down
Don't you think the early 2000s seem so far away? (Ay-ay-ay-ay)

Ladies, begin your sun salutations
Transcendental in your meditations (Love and light)
You can burn sage, and I'll cleanse the crystals
We can get high, but only if the wind blows (Blows just right)

I can't feel a thing
I keep looking at my mood ring
Tell me how I'm feeling
Floating away, floating away

I'm tryna get well from the inside
Plants and celebrity news, all the vitamins I consume
Let's fly somewhere eastern, they'll have what I need (They'll have what I need)
Let's go

Ladies, begin your sun salutations
Pluto in Scorpio generation (Love and light)
You can burn sage, and I'll cleanse the crystals
We can get high, but only if the wind blows (Blows just right, ri-ri-ri-right)

I can't feel a thing
I keep looking at my mood ring
Tell me how I'm feeling
Floating away, floating away
All the sad girls sing
We'll keep dancing 'til the mood rings
Tell us how we're feeling
Floating away, floating away

Take me to some kinda
Take me to some kinda
Take me to some kinda place (Anywhere)
Watch the sun set, look back on my life (Take me to some kinda)
I just wanna know, will it be alright? (Take me to some kinda)
Take me to some kinda place (Anywhere)

"Oceanic Feeling"

It's a blue day
We could jump Bulli
When I hit that water
When it holds me
I think about my father
Doin' the same thing
When he was a boy
When he was a boy
It's a blue day
We could go fishing
You'll catch the big one
Ah

Slidin' the knife under the skin
Grateful for this offering
And all the livin' things under the sun
Under the sun

Little brother, I think you're an angel
I see your silver chain levitate
When you're kick-flipping
Baby boy, you're super cool
I know you're scared, so was I
But all will be revealed in time (Time, time)

Oh, look, the rays are in the bay now
Can you hear the waves and the cicadas all around?
I can make anything real
Brain so hot, it's a summer body
Every day is blue and never cloudy
Don't look down
I can make anything real

In the future
If I have a daughter
Will she have my waist
Or my widow's peak?
My dreamer's disposition or my wicked streak?

Will she split a tab with her lover?
And laugh at the stars like her mother
When she was a girl?
When she was a girl?

Now the cherry-black lipstick's gathering dust in a drawer
I don't need her anymore
'Cause I got this power
I just had to breathe (Breathe out, breathe out, breathe out, breathe out)
And tune in (Tune in, tune in, tune in, tune in)
I just had to breathe (Breathe out, breathe out, breathe out, breathe out)
And tune in (Tune in, tune in, tune in, tune in)
I just had to breathe
And tune in
I just had to breathe
And tune in
I just had to breathe

Oh, was enlightenment found?
No, but I'm tryin', takin' it one year at a time
Oh, oh, can you hear the sound?
It's shimmerin' higher
On the beach, I'm buildin' a pyre
(Use the wood brought in by the tide)
I know you'll show me how, I'll know when it's time
To take off my robes and step into the choir

"Helen Of Troy"

Hey, hey

You've heard it all before
One minute, I was killing 'em all
And the next, a brown suit wouldn't let me perform, ah
Typical
So I took a happy face
And it's coming on like a charm
I don't wanna get lost, I wanna worship the sun
If you want, you can come

I'm in my own little golden age
But it's such a pill when they don't appreciate

So when you smoke that cigarette
Or when you talk shit 'bout an old friend
I know it's hard, but do your best
Give yourself a break, have a little faith, ah
Let's hear it for the girls
Living in the modern world

They're banging on the door
"Everyone please make way
For the girl who looks like she flew in from outer space
Yesterday, eh"
I think I'll wait it out
My little thing is keeping 'em keen
They could be drinking with you, but they'll be looking at me
This whole time, I've been playing it coy
The city's falling for me just like I'm Helen of Troy, ah

So when you're broke, can't get ahead
Or when you take it out on your boyfriend
I know it's hard, but do your best
Give yourself a break, have a little faith
Let's hear it for the girls
Living in the modern world

Give yourself a break, have a little faith
Let's hear it for the girls
Living in the modern world
Let's hear it for the girls (Let's hear it for the girls)
Living in the modern world (Living in the modern world)

"Hold No Grudge"

Remember when we used to sing, baby, up in your room
Before your mother got home?
There was a sound to our innocence
Our voices were lovers in the same bed
Now I'm not sure how they would sound, isn't that sad?
Now that the ocean's all waves and the diamonds are blood
There's a new girl on your song
I didn't know that I could be replaced
Years ago, I tried to get a message to you
But I never heard back, I never heard back

Where did we go wrong?
Our haven was always in the song
But just when I go to close the gates permanently
I realise that it isn't me

No, I don't keep a list, can't hold a grudge
Don't you think that we both might've done some growing up?
Well, I know that some shit was said and done
But it's such a different world now, I can't hate anyone

Remember when we woke at dawn
Saw the silver sun in your old CitroÃ«n?
And remember when we took them on?
Stoners on the run, How the West Was Won

Remember when we used to swim, baby, no one around
Take off all our clothes?
And in the clear cold, we were born again
I used to count down to your birthday
Now I'm not sure if it's June or July, isn't that sad?

Where did we go wrong?
Our haven was always in the song
But just when I go to close the gates permanently
I realise that it isn't me

No, I don't keep a list, can't hold a grudge (Hold no grudge)
Don't you think that we both might've done some growing up?
Yeah, I know that some shit was said and done (Said and done)
But it's such a different world now, I can't hate anyone

Remember when we woke at dawn
Saw the silver sun in your old CitroÃ«n?
And remember when we took them on?
Stoners on the run, How the West Was Won

Acting my age, not my horoscope
Guess that's growing up
Now I'm sending you love and wishing you well
Wherever you are

"Everybody Wants To Rule The World"
(from "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" soundtrack)

Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you

Acting on your best behavior
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own desire
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most of freedom
And of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do, I'll be right behind you
So glad we've almost made it
So sad we had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world

"Flicker (Kanye West Rework)"
(from "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1" soundtrack)

I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
It keeps my veins hot, the fires find a home in me
I move through town, I'm quiet like a fight
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it

And now people talk to me, but nothing ever hits home
People talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
I'm done with it (ooh)

This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We're at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

I dream all year, but they're not the sweet kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time

And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison
And I'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me
I'm done with it (ooh)

This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We're at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat
Sparking up my heart
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat

"Good Fights"

Face the world, tell your friends
You don't really love them
But you really love when
Braid your hair and give in
We could try to get in to the place where it ends
Where everything ends, it spins again

Oh, I didn't come all this way just to blow the night
Oh, you can feel sorry for people that are in your mind
Oh, and if it feels close, even when you don't feel alright
(It's alright, it's alright)
Everyone stay up like a good fight

There's a place in your head for what doesn't make sense
For the things you don't get
Look them up when you get in
We could try to get in, get rejected again
Laugh it off again, I guess oh well

Oh, I didn't come all this way just to blow the night
Oh, you can feel sorry for people are in your mind
Oh, and if it feels close, even when you don't feel alright
(It's alright, it's alright)
Everyone stay up like a good fight

Incurred on to bright green eyes
You used to love to spend up time
Driving like a coil in the little lights out
Money, we solve our safe
She'll toss her head and play again
Examine every face and realize
Oh, it's good to feel again

Oh, I didn't come all this way just to blow the night
Oh, you can feel sorry for people are in your mind
Oh, and if it feels close, even when you don't feel alright
(It's alright, it's alright)
Everyone stay up like a good fight

A couple rebel Top Gun pilots
Flyin' with nowhere to be, ooh-ooh
Don't know you super well
But I think that you might be the same as me
Behave abnormally

Let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Yeah, awesome, right?
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
See me rollin', showin' someone else love
Dancin' with our shoes off
Know I think you're awesome, right?

Pushing our limits, unbuckled for the ride, mm
We're way too far from home

Walk, never fall, but we still run
So pour up, pour up another one

Go and shoot me that look in your eyes
And you're here, I'm yours, you're mine
Find each other when we're losin' our minds
Then we take it all off
You're a runaway train, yeah
And you got me so faded
And I don't wanna chase it, no
You know I think you're awesome, right?

"Ladder Song"
(from "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1" soundtrack)

No one knows where the ladder goes
You're gonna lose what you love the most
You're not alone in anything
You're not unique in dying

I feel estranged every now and then
Fall asleep reading science fiction
I wanna fly in your silver ship
Let my mama hang and my sister sit

It's on now
The days are long now
The ups and the sundowns
And a twisting mind

If I gotta go first
I'll do it on my terms
I'm tired of traitors
Always changing sides
They were friends of mine

Don't hang around once the promise breaks
Or you'll be there when the next one's made
Kiss the feet of a charlatan
Some imagine freedom

All the rest is predictable
Trying your hardest to melt the snow
Tie the knots to concentrate
Keep on pulling, that rope will break

We'll welcome the new age
Covered in warrior paint
Lights from the jungle to the sky

See now, a star bursts
Looks just like a blood orange
Don't it just make you wanna cry
Precious friend of mine?

Will I know when it's finally done?
This whole life's a hallucination
You're not alone in anything
You're not alone in trying to be

"No Better"

We roll in heavy summer when there's strength in our numbers
And your breath's hot and gross but I kiss you like a lover
Legs stick to the seats of the car someone grew into
I forget the knowledge from the lessons that I went to

And Jamie picks fights but they're weak and short-lived
Because no one can be bothered when it's humid like this
And we roll in heavy summer like it's shameful to be underneath a ceiling or a roof try come out and steal our thunder

Now the days are getting cooler
And the burning of our limbs doesn't happen quite as bad and the burn is just
Skin-deep in the fantasies and dreams of the winter like the movies
That we watched to pretend it wasn't winter
And everywhere we go I can feel a subtle taste of the deeds outgrown and the welcome overstayed
And you're no better at swimming than you were in the beginning but you come over at night and we practice all the breathing

Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down

I'll pull the trick if I want to
I'll pull the trick and it comes true
I'm chewing gum and it's killing you
We're getting dead and it's the right way to do it
I see you happy in the front seat
I see you with all of your front teeth
You're allergic but you never said
We're getting dead and it's the right way

Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down

"Precious Metals"
(live version)

The Chanel, the Dior and the Prada
Take it home, make a fire in the garden
Sundance kids, so godless
One day it's gonna be not like this
Black sand on all our beaches
Witchcraft, split lip and a bee sting
But what I really wanna know is

Do I look like a fool?
'Cause I must be a fool
To hold on to precious metals like I do, I do, I do
To hold on to precious metals like I do, I do, I do

The Chanel, the Dior, and the Prada
Give my best to the ones that are bothered
Take a flight trip to Jakarta
All the kids at the shows make it louder
All of the feelings and all of the tears are going
All of the secrets and all of the schemes that don't go my way
I wish you would come back, didn't want to run back
Come back, bet you want to come back
And I'll find you

Do I look like a fool?
'Cause I must be a fool
To hold on to precious metals like I do (ah), do (ah), do (ah)
To hold on to precious metals like I do (ah), do (ah), do (ah)

Ah, ah, ah...

"Supercut (El-P Remix)"
(feat. Run The Jewels)

[Lorde:]
In my
Supercut of us
Supercut
Supercut of, supercut of, supercut of us

In my head
I play a supercut of us
All the magic we gave off
All the love we had and lost
And in my head
The visions never stop
These ribbons wrap me up
But when I reach for you
There's just a supercut

Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us

In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
In your car, the supercut of us
We keep tryna talk about us
Slow motion, I'm watchin' our love
In your car, the supercut of, supercut of

[Killer Mike:]
We is the villains, and there ain't no chillin'
Get body bags and the toe tags, yeah
Scoundrels in housin', we tore through your town
And we reload it and now we back, man
Forgiato rollin' on a '96 Impala
With a pretty thing, show me where I'm slayin'
I ain't playin' with you lames, 700 horse in the Hellcat
Take ya bitch, where ya at?

[El-P:]
Dirty, all-black Jeep, 2018
With the clean rhyme rappers on deck, check
Came with the bad bars, bully with the big box
Shush when the runners on set
G-G-Give it up, you don't got a bit of luck left
Nah, not even a itty bit of fresh (Good lord)
Fall on your sword for the crime abhorrent
That's your reward for the mindless whorin'

[Killer Mike:]
This for everybody that hated
Michael and Jamie, we made it
Every debt due, we paid it
My cadence is heinous
You keep tryna play us, and you gon' be famous
And just like the top on my 7-5 drop
I'm just hittin' a button and you gon' be brainless
And that's from the back of a 'lac where I'm smokin' the sack
With my girl, watchin' seasons of Shameless

[El-P:]
There's no manual, Run The Jewels publish shit annual
Every minute I'm in it, I'm runnin' a clinic
Wild animal, livin' like a Fine Young Cannibal
Citizen of cynics, admit it, the kid get it
Earth's a hot block, the pot get chop-chopped
You walk and watch blocks my heart should pop off
The hot rocks shooters will knock your whole op off
That's why I don't got tocks on the clock to rock soft

[Lorde:]
So I fall
Into continents and cars
All the stages and the stars
I turn all of it
To just a suâ

Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of, supercut of, super, super

"Swingin' Party"

Bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending, can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail

If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line

Pound the prairie pavement, losing proposition
Quitting school and going to work and never going fishing
Water all around, I never learned how to swim now

If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line

Bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending, can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail

If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong is what you want, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line

"Yellow Flicker Beat"
(from "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1" soundtrack)

I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
It keeps my veins hot, the fire's found a home in me
I move through town, I'm quiet like a fight
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie

And now people talk to me, but nothing ever hits home
People talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
I'm done with it (ooh)

This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We're at the start, the colours disappear
I never watch the stars, there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with the red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

I dream all year, but they're not the sweet kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time

And now people talk to me, I'm slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison
And I'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me
I'm done with it (ooh)

This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We're at the start, the colours disappear
I never watch the stars, there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with the red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat
