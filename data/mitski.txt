"Liquid Smooth"

I'm beautiful, I know 'cause it's the season
But what am I to do with all this beauty?
Biology, I am an organism, I'm chemical
That's all, that is all

I'm liquid-smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid-smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall, capture me

Or at least take my picture
å´©ãã¦ããåã«
[Japanese: "Kuzurete yuku mae ni"]
I'm pulsing, my blood is red and unafraid of living
Beginning to end

I'm liquid-smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid-smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall

How I feel this river rushing through my veins
With nowhere else to go, it circles 'round

I'm liquid-smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid-smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall, capture me

"Eric"

You like control, well, I do too
Take off my clothes and watch me move
You can come closer, I'll let you hurt me
How you choose

Help me with the zipper on my skirt, it's stuck
As you kneel, I'll be watching you fix me
This view of you, of the top of your head makes me forgive you

But how long, how long can we play this way?
I'm tired, I'm tired of not loving you
My heart, my heart wants to hold you
But I know, I know, I know the rules

Blue light, dark room, the white of your teeth
As you smile at my trembling shoulders
But your skin, did you notice your skin?
It cries a soft weep like mine

I'll sell, I'll sell my whole to you
What's my, what's my, what's my price?
How 'bout, how 'bout just a part of you?
'Cause I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want

"Brand New City"

One, two
Honey, what'd you take?

Think my brain is rotting in places
I think my heart is ready to die
I think my body is falling in pieces
I think my blood is passing me by

Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?
Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?

I think my fate is losing its patience
I think the ground is pulling me down
I think my life is losing momentum
I think my ways are wearing me down

But if I gave up on being pretty, I wouldn't know how to be alive
I should move to a brand new city and teach myself how to die

Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?
Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?
Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?
Honey, what'd you take? What'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?

"Real Men"

Real men don't need other people, and
Real men suck it in
Real men don't flinch or bleed in public
Oh, I think I'm a real man

Little boys cry and look around for comfort
And always get what they want
Little boys see toys and say, "I can take that!"
Oh, you are my little boy

Though honestly, sir
All I wanna do is get naked in front of you
So you can look me up and down and tell me
"Well done, girl. You're looking good."

Real men keep cool in the face of a fire
Go down with the ship
And real men don't eat
'Cause they're above that, damn it
Oh, I'm gonna be a real man

Though honestly, sir
All I wanna do is get naked in front of you
So you can look me up and down
And give me your love for being so good

But little boys hold me, color me
Praise me, make me feel lovely
For a little while
So little boy, say you want me
'Cause, well, I can't take it
Go ahead
Do it, do it

"Wife"

You're home, you're home, you're home to me
So leave me, leave me, leave me a map
I'm here at my cliff looking down

I cannot bear you a son
But I will try
For if I am not yours, what am I?
I daydream I'd give one a name of my own
For I, even I, even I am on loan

I have, I have, I watch a dream breaking
Breaking, breaking, breaking me
Away from my cliff, I am looking down from

I cannot bear you a son
I have tried
But if I am not yours, what am I?
I daydream I'd give him a name of my own
For I, even mine, even mine is unknown

So let me go towards the morning star
With hope it won't disappear

"Bag Of Bones"

I'm all used up, pretty boy
Over and over again, my nail colors are wearing off
See my hands, pretty boy
What do they tell you?
'Cause I've looked down at them, not knowing why
And after everything's done and I'm all undone
You can hear my high heels walking on
Clickety-clacking through the night
I'm carrying my bag of bones

Fluorescent store lights, you shine through the night
Illuminate my pores and you tear me apart
Mercy on me, would you please spare me tonight?
I'm tired of this searching, would you let me let go?

I know my room is a mess
Over and over again I tell myself I'll clean tomorrow
Just move the stuff up off the bed
And do what you came here to do
But first, open up a window for me
And let the cool air in, feel the night slip in
As it softly glides along your back
And I hope you leave right before the sun comes up
So I can watch it alone

Fluorescent store lights, you shine through the night
Illuminate my pores and you tear me apart
Mercy on me, would you please spare me tonight?
I'm tired of this searching, would you let me let go?

And I can take a little bit more
Let's shake this poet out of the beast
Just a, just a little bit more
Let's shake this poet out of the beast

"Door"

There is a door to me
I've never seen it
Sometimes I get closer to it
But I've never found it
At twilight, I almost had it
But then the night fell
I looked out at the dark and wondered
How could I have lost it?

Then, one night, at the park I saw it
With my cheek in the dirt
I couldn't move underneath the dark
But at least I finally found it
Cried out a creak and opened
To show me what's beyond it
A hopeless violence
I named it "love"

"Pearl Diver"

Hmm
Hmm

Treasure hunter, you are dead
The light of the world is fading
You cannot see the other end
Your body's lost all feeling
Those creatures of your woken mind
Don't fear them or their hunger
Forgive the sea, follow the tide
With the monsters on your shoulder

Pearl diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver, dive, dive down
Pearl diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver, dive, dive down

Oh, hunter, if you didn't want
The beautiful so badly
Perhaps you would've found it
In your spirit singing softly
But hunter, you were human
Don't forget it and go safely
And I, I'll live without you
Though the struggle will be daily

Pearl diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver, dive, dive down
Pearl diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver, dive, dive down

Oh, oh
Oh, ooh

Treasure hunter, you are dead
The light of the world is fading

"Goodbye, My Danish Sweetheart"

There's nobody better than you
It took me a while 'til I knew
But you knew from the start it was us, didn't you?
It just took me a while 'til I knew

Now I lay as I study a blank wall
Would you spare me your voice if I call?
'Cause you waited and watered my heart 'til it grew
You just grew a little smarter too

So I don't blame you if you want to
Bury me in your memory, I'm not the girl I ought to be, but
Maybe when you tell your friends, you
Can tell them what you saw in me, and not how I turned out to be

There's some kind of burning inside me
It's kept me from falling apart
And I'm sure that you've seen what it's done to my heart
But it's kept me from falling apart

Now here I lay, as I wonder about you
Would you just tell me what I'm meant to do?
'Cause I've waited and watered my heart 'til it grew
You can see how it's blossomed for you

And I don't blame you if you want to
Bury me in your memory, I'm not the girl I ought to be, but
Maybe when you tell your friends, you
Can tell them what you saw in me, and not the way I am

And I don't mean to make your heart blue
But could we be what we're meant to be?
I'm just about to beg you please, and
Then when you tell your friends, you can
Tell them what you saw in me, and
Not the way I used to be

'Cause there's nobody better than you

"Shame"

It feels so good
It feels so good
And right outside the door nobody knows
They're right outside the door and they don't know how it
Feels so good
It feels so good

I never was very good
I haven't been so good
But right outside the door nobody knows
They're right outside the door and they don't know how it
Feels so good
It feels so good

And I don't need anything other than you

"Because Dreaming Costs Money, My Dear"

I can still smell the fire
Though I know it's long died out
The smoke still hangs in my hair
And on some quiet evenings it burns my eyes

So darling, play your violin
I know it's what you live for
Darling, play your violin
We will manage somehow

I once lived in the sea
Bring me to your ear, you can hear
The tide where I used to be
Though now I'm but a shell
Oh, baby
Don't say sorry

Darling, play your violin
I know it's what you live for
Darling, play your violin
We will manage somehow

Don't dare regret anything
Remember what you're here for
You just play your violin
We will manage somehow

"Humpty"

I'll live in the bathtub
It's cool and clean
It's smooth and it's steady
It's all that I need

I broke our belongings
They're all on the floor
The room is now empty
Nothing left to throw

All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But they crack and crumble, it's all too much
Too frail for me to touch

All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But they crack and crumble, it's all too much
Too frail for me to touch

I'll live in the bathtub
Surrounded by tiles
All so square and so steady
I will die in their cool, cool arms

I broke what you gave me
But you kept giving more
And I'm sorry for taking
But I keep wanting more, more, more

All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But they crack and crumble, it's all too much
Too frail for me to touch

All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But, Humpty Dumpty, you're much too much
Too frail for me to touch

Humpty Dumpty
It's much too much

All the eggshells are on the ground

"Circle"

There's a lie that I told to you
That now I can't tell the truth
And it ate me inside, so one soft drunken night
I slept with a man you knew

And in the morning I walked home alone
And the businessmen saw my bones
With my skirt in their eyes, they remembered the nights
When they were that man you knew

You told me once
You were happy to have me
But I never gave me away

There's the lie that I told to you

I would give you my heart, I think
But it's up in a branch of a tree
It was only to tease when he climbed up the tree
Put my heart where I couldn't reach

I didn't mind, I adored him so
We forgot, and we left for home
And that was so long ago, now the tree it has grown

And nobody knows my lover is buried underground
Nobody knows my lover is buried underground
Nobody knows my lover is buried underground

There's a lie that I told to you

"I Want You"

I want you
I hold one card
That I can't use
But I want you

You're coming back
And it's the end of the world
We're starting over
And I love you darling
And I am done, dear

You're in the house
And I am here in the car
I just need a quiet place
Where I can scream
How I love you

I found you
I found the door
But when I stepped through
There was no floor

You're coming back
And it's the end of the world
We're starting over
And I love you darling
And I am done, dear

You're in the house
And I am here in the car
I just need a quiet place
Where I can scream
How I love you

I want you
I want you

"Square"

Your room was square
I once noticed from there
In your bed, as you slept
And I held my breath
Everything had its own place
And I wondered what space would I take
In the order you kept

I tried to eat like your girlfriend
Just tea in the night, I'd end up
Too hungry to sleep
So lying awake, I would follow the aching inside
I would find
It's for you won't be mine

I tried my hardest, for I'd never learned
God's very simple and love shouldn't burn
And I would've offered you all that you yearned for
But I was still waiting for something to earn

What is that quiet of snow in the night?
The dark rings with white noise
As you stand and drown
Maybe it's all of these snowflakes, screaming
A choir of mute
As they brace for the ground

Well, that's my ride
Hope you had a good night
You know, you made me happy
Here, shake my hand
You make such a good man
Never once did you know me

I tried my hardest, for how do you learn
God's very simple and love doesn't burn
And maybe you'd offered me all that I yearned for
But I was still waiting for something to earn

Silly me, waiting

"Strawberry Blond"

I love everybody
Because I love you
When you stood up
Walked away, barefoot
And the grass where you lay
Left a bed in your shape
I looked over it
And I ached

I love everybody
Because I love you
I don't need the city, and I
Don't need proof
All I need, darling
Is a life in your shape
I picture it, soft
And I ache

Look at you, strawberry blond

Reach out the car window
Trying to hold the wind
You tell me you love her
I give you a grin
Oh all I ever wanted was a
Life in your shape
So I follow the white lines
Follow the white lines
Keep my eyes on the road
As I ache

Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm?
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way

Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm?
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way

Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm?
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way

Isaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah
Isaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah

"Class Of 2013"

Mom, I'm tired
Can I sleep in your house tonight?
Mom, is it alright
If I stay for a year or two?
Mom, I'll be quiet
It would be just to sleep at night
And I'll leave once I figure out
How to pay for my own life too

Mom, would you wash my back?
This once, and then we can forget
And I'll leave what I'm chasing
For the other girls to pursue

Mom, am I still young?
Can I dream for a few months more?

"Texas Reznikoff"

It's beautiful out today
I wish you could take me upstate
To the little place you would tell me about
When you'd sense that I'd want to escape

Texas is a land-locked state
It's a little bit far away
From the water, from the home that I've wanted to make
It somehow, in the city, you make it there and you make it
Anywhere, anywhere
But I've been anywhere and it's not what I want
I wanna be still with you

You keep your socks on in bed
Keep our hearth warm
"See the trees' shadows lie in black pools in the lawns"
You're the breeze in my Austin nights
You're the breeze in my Austin nights
You're the breeze in my Austin nights

"Townie"

There's a party and we're all going
And we're all growing up
Somebody's driving and he will be drinking
And no one's going back
'Cause we've tried hungry and we've tried full and
Nothing seems enough
So tonight, tonight
The boys are gonna go for
More more more

And I want a love that falls as fast
As a body from the balcony, and
I want to kiss like my heart is hitting the ground
I'm holding my breath with a baseball bat
Though I don't know what I'm waiting for
I am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be

Smell that, it's wet grass, and smoke in my hair
I think I've had enough
But he wants a finale and I came prepared
And we're not going back
And I've tried sharing and I've tried caring
And I've tried putting out
But the boys, boys, boys keep coming on for
More more more
And change, change, change is gonna come, but
When, when, when?

And I want a love that falls as fast
As a body from the balcony, and
I want to kiss like my heart is chasing me down
I'm holding my breath with a baseball bat
Though I don't know what I'm waiting for
I am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be

And I want a love that falls as fast
As a body from the balcony, and
I want to kiss like my heart is hitting the ground
I'm holding my breath with a baseball bat
Though I don't know what I'm waiting for
I am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be

I'm not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be
I wanna be what my body wants me to be

"First Love / Late Spring"

The black hole of the window where you sleep
The night breeze carries something sweet, a peach tree
Wild women don't get the blues
But I find that lately, I've been crying like a tall child

So please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me
Mune ga hachikire-sÅde
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me, "Don't," so I can crawl back in

And I was so young when I behaved twenty-five
Yet now, I find I've grown into a tall child
And I don't wanna go home yet
Let me walk to the top of the big night sky

Please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me
Mune ga hachikire-sÅde
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me, "Don't," so I can crawl back in

One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me, "Don't," so I can crawl back in
Please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe

"Francis Forever"

I don't know what to do without you
I don't know where to put my hands
I've been trying to lay my head down
But I'm writing this at 3 AM

I don't need the world to see
That I've been the best I can be, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me

On sunny days, I go out walking
I end up on a tree-lined street
I look up at the gaps of sunlight
I miss you more than anything

I don't need the world to see
That I've been the best I can be, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me

And autumn comes when you're not yet done
With the summer passing by, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me

"I Don't Smoke"

I don't smoke
Except for when I'm missing you
To remember your mouth, how it
Tasted true
And I don't smoke
Except for after I've held you, baby
Being with you
Makes the flame burn good

So if you need to be mean
Be mean to me
I can take it and put it inside of me
If your hands need to break
More than trinkets in your room
You can lean on my arm
As you break my heart

I'm what's left of when we
Swam under the moon
Now the rest of my days are just
Waiting for when
You've calmed down and tell me
I was meant for you, baby
Being with you
Makes the flame burn good

If you need to be mean
Be mean to me
I can take it and put it inside of me
If your hands need to break
More than trinkets in your room
You can lean on my arm
As you break my heart

Just don't leave me alone
Wondering where you are
I am stronger than you give me
Credit for

If your hands need to break
More than trinkets in your room
You can lean on my arm
As you break my heart

"Jobless Monday"

It's a windy afternoon
Can't afford to buy my food
Or the drive I need to go
Further than they said I'd go

He only loves me when
There's a means he means to end
Oh I miss when we first met
He didn't know me yet

So take me out baby
Makes no difference where we'll be
As long as we're out in the sun
Take me out baby

Take me out baby
Doesn't matter where we'll be
But please under the light of day
Take me out
Take me out
Take me out baby
Take me out to

"Drunk Walk Home"

I will retire to the Salton Sea
At the age of 23
For I'm starting to learn I may never be free
But though I may never be free
Fuck you and your money
I'm tired of your money

And I sit on the curb 'cause it's the prettiest night
With no one else in sight
You know I wore this dress for you
These killer heels for you
See the dark, it moves
With every breath of the breeze

"I Will"

I will take good care of you
I will take good care of you
Everything you feel is good
If you would only let you
I will wash your hair at night
And dry it off with care
I will see your body bare
And still I will live here

So stay with me
Hold my hand
There's no need
To be brave

And all the quiet nights you bear
Seal them up with care
No one needs to know they're there
For I will hold them for you

'Cause all I ever wanted is here
All I ever wanted
All I want is
Always you
It's always you

And we're not out of the tunnel
I bet you, though, there's an end

Stay with me
Hold my hand
There's no need
To be brave

And while you sleep
I'll be scared
So by the time you wake
I'll be brave
I'll be brave
I'll be brave

"Carry Me Out"

At night
On the roof top
I untie my hair
And watch from my plastic chair
As my dark hair
Unleashes the night

The scent of flowers
Still in bloom from morning shower
And I
Say your name
In hopes you'll hear it in the stars

And carry me out
Carry me out

I drive when it rains
At night, when it rains, I drive
And the headlight spirits
They lead me down the Styx
So black it shines

And carry me out
Carry me out

At night
On the roof top
I untie my hair
And watch from my plastic chair
As my dark hair
Unleashes the night

"Last Words Of A Shooting Star"

All of this turbulence wasn't forecasted
Apologies from the intercom
And I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
They'll think of me kindly
When they come for my things
They'll never know how I'd stared at the dark in that room
With no thoughts
Like a blood-sniffing shark
And while my dreams made music in the night
Carefully
I was going to live

You wouldn't leave 'til we loved in the morning
You'd learned from movies how love ought to be
And you'd say you love me and look in my eyes
But I know through mine you were
Looking in yours
And did you know the Liberty Bell is a replica
Silently housed in its original walls
And while its dreams played music in the night
Quietly
It was told to believe

I always wanted to die clean and pretty
But I'd be too busy on working days
So I am relieved that the turbulence wasn't forecasted
I couldn't have changed anyways

I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
Goodbye

"Happy"

Happy came to visit me, he bought cookies on the way
I poured him tea, and he told me, "It'll all be okay"
Well, I told him I'd do anything to have him stay with me
So he laid me down, and I felt happy, come inside of me
He laid me down, and I felt happy

Oh, if you're going, take the train
So I can hear it rumble, one last rumble
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you

I was in the bathroom, I didn't hear him leave
I locked the door behind him, and I turned around to see
All the cookie wrappers and the empty cups of tea
Well, I sighed and mumbled to myself, "Again, I have to clean"
I sighed and mumbled to myself

If you're going, take the train
So I can hear it rumble, one last rumble
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you
And if you're going, take the moon
Then maybe I will see you, in the night I'll see you
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you

"Dan The Dancer"

Dan had very long limbs
From leading day to day
Hanging onto a cliff
That stretched him everyday
And when she'd ask to hold hands
He would smile and
Let one of his hands go
His whole life in one hand
His whole life

When he'd say goodnight and
Leave her doorstep
He'd use his last strength
To wave back
And once back in his room
Once back in his room
He'd return his waving hand
Back to its cliff
He liked her more than life itself
I'm sure

'Cause Dan had never danced outside of his room
When no one was home and he would stop to hear the door
So when he moved with you
And felt his body let go
Of course you couldn't know
It was you and you alone
That he had shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
And he would never tell you that it was his first time

"Once More To See You"

In the rear-view mirror
I saw the setting sun on your neck
And felt the taste of you bubble up inside me
But with everybody watching us
Our every move
We do have reputations
We keep it secret
Won't let them have it

So come inside and be with me
Alone with me
Alone
With me alone
If you would let me give you pinky-promise kisses
Then I wouldn't have to scream your name atop of every roof in the city of my heart
If I could see you
Once more to see you

Come inside and be with me
Alone with me
Alone
With me alone
If you would let me give you pinky-promise kisses
Then I wouldn't have to scream your name atop of every roof in the city of my heart
If I could see you
Once more to see you
If I could see you
Once more to see you

"Fireworks"

One morning, this sadness will fossilize
And I will forget how to cry
I'll keep going to work, and you won't see a change
Save, perhaps, a slight gray in my eye

I will go jogging routinely
Calmly and rhythmically run
And when I find that a knife's sticking out of my side
I'll pull it out without questioning why

And then, one warm summer night
I'll hear fireworks outside
And I'll listen to the memories as they cry, cry, cry

I will be married to silence
The gentleman won't say a word
But you know, oh, you know in the quiet he holds
Runs a river that will never find home

And then, one warm summer night
I'll hear fireworks outside
And I'll listen to the memories as they cry, cry, cry
Oh, one warm summer night
I'll hear fireworks outside
And I'll listen to the memories as they cry, cry, cry

Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry

"Your Best American Girl"

If I could, I'd be your little spoon
And kiss your fingers forevermore
But, big spoon, you have so much to do
And I have nothing ahead of me
You're the sun, you've never seen the night
But you hear its song from the morning birds
Well, I'm not the moon, I'm not even a star
But awake at night I'll be singing to the birds

Don't wait for me, I can't come

Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do, I think I do
And you're an all-American boy
I guess I couldn't help trying to be your best American girl

You're the one
You're all I ever wanted
I think I'll regret this

Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do, I finally do
And you're an all-American boy
I guess I couldn't help trying to be the best American girl
Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do, I think I do

"I Bet On Losing Dogs"

My baby, my baby
You're my baby, say it to me
Baby, my baby
Tell your baby that I'm your baby

I bet on losing dogs
I know they're losing and I pay for my place
By the ring
Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down
I'll be there on their side
I'm losing by their side

Will you let me, baby
Lose on losing dogs?
I know they're losing and I pay for my place
By the ring
Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down

I wanna feel it
I bet on losing dogs
I always want you when I'm finally fine
How you'd be over me looking in my eyes when I come
Someone to watch me die
Someone to watch me die
I bet on losing dogs

Did you get that?

"My Body's Made Of Crushed Little Stars"

I'm not doing anything
I'm not doing anything
My body's made of crushed little stars
And I'm not doing anything
I wanna see the whole world
I wanna see the whole world
I don't know how I'm gonna pay rent
I wanna see the whole world

Would you kill me, Jerusalem?
Kill me, Jerusalem
Kill me, Jerusalem
Come find me

I better ace that interview
I better ace that interview
I should tell them that I'm not afraid to die
I better ace that interview

Uh
I work better under a deadline
I work better under a deadline
I pick an age when I'm gonna disappear
Until then I can try again
Until then I can try again

Kill me, Jerusalem
Kill me, Jerusalem
Kill me, Jerusalem
Go and kill me

"Thursday Girl"

Glory, glory, glory to the night that shows me what I am
As I go to the party on my knees
Saying, "Take it all, please..."

And tell me no
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Somebody, please
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Tell me no

Glory, glory, glory to the night
It shows me what I am (Glory)
I'm not happy or sad, just up or down
And always bad

Tell me no
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Somebody, please
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Tell me no
Somebody here
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Tell me no

"A Loving Feeling"

What do you do with a loving feeling
If the loving feeling makes you all alone?
What do you do with a loving feeling
If they only love you when you're all alone?

Holding hands under the table
Meeting up in your bedroom
Making love to other people
Telling each other it's all good
Kisses like pink cotton candy
Talking to everyone but me
I'm staying up late just in case you come up and ask to leave with me

What do you do with a loving feeling
If the loving feeling makes you all alone?
What do you do with a loving feeling
If they only love you when you're all alone?
What do you do with a loving feeling
If the loving feeling makes you all alone?
What do you do with a loving feeling
If they only love you when you're all alone?

You only love me when we're all alone

"Crack Baby"

Down empty streets sniffing glue, me and you
Blank, open eyes watch the moonflower bloom
It's been a long, hard, twenty-year summer vacation
All these twenty years trying to fill the void

Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you had it once
And you know that you want it back
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you're needing it
And you know that you need it bad

With wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones

Went to your room thinking, maybe, you'll feel something
But all I saw was your burning body waiting
All these twenty years on a vacation

Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you had it once
And you know that you want it back
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you're needing it
And you know that you need it bad
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you want it
Yeah, you know that you want it
You know that you
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you need it
And you know that you need it bad

With wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones

"A Burning Hill"

Today, I will wear my white button-down
I'm tired of wanting more
I think I'm finally worn
For you have a way of promising things
And I've been a forest fire
I am a forest fire
And I am the fire, and I am the forest
And I am a witness watching it
I stand in a valley watching it
And you are not there at all

So today, I will wear my white button-down
I can at least be neat
Walk out and be seen as clean
And I'll go to work, and I'll go to sleep
And I'll love the littler things
I'll love some littler things

"Geyser"

You're my number one
You're the one I want
And I've turned down
Every hand that has beckoned me to come
You're my number one
You're the one I want
And I've turned down
Every hand that has beckoned me to come

'Cause you're the one I got
You're the one I got
So I'll keep turning down the hands
That beckon me to come

Though I'm a geyser, feel it bubbling from below
Hear it call, hear it call, hear it call to me, constantly
And hear the harmony only when it's harming me
It's not real, it's not real, it's not real enough

But I will be the one you need
The way I can't be without you
I will be the one you need
I just can't be without you

"Why Didn't You Stop Me?"

I know that I ended it, but
Why won't you chase after me?
You know me better than I do
So why didn't you stop me?

Why didn't you stop me
Why didn't you stop me
And paint it over?

I look for a picture of you
To keep in my pocket
But I can't seem to find one
Where you look how I remember

Look how I remember
Look how I remember
Paint it over

"Old Friend"

We nearly drowned
For such a silly thing
Someone who loves me now
Better than you
And that pretty friend is
Finally yours, and
I'll be around on Sunday, if

You'll meet me at Blue Diner
I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take anything you wanna give me, baby

I haven't told anyone
Just like we promised
Have you?
Every time I drive through the city where you're from
I squeeze a little

Meet me at Blue Diner
I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take anything you wanna give me, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby
Blue Diner, I'll take anything you wanna give me, baby

"A Pearl"

You're growing tired of me
You love me so hard and I still can't sleep
You're growing tired of me
And all the things I don't talk about

Sorry, I don't want your touch
It's not that I don't want you
Sorry, I can't take your touch

It's just that I fell in love with a war
Nobody told me it ended
And it left a pearl in my head
And I roll it around
Every night, just to watch it glow
Every night, baby, that's where I go

Sorry, I don't want your touch
It's not that I don't want you
Sorry, I can't take your touch

There's a hole that you fill
You fill, you fill

But it's just that I fell in love with a war
And nobody told me it ended
And it left a pearl in my head
And I roll it around
Every night, just to watch it glow
Every night, baby, that's where I go
Just to watch it glow

"Lonesome Love"

I call you, to see you again
So I can win, and this can finally end
Spend an hour on my makeup
To prove something

Walk up in my high heels
All high and mighty
And you say, "Hello"
And I lose

'Cause nobody butters me up like you, and
Nobody fucks me like me

In the morning, in a taxi
I'm so very paying for
Why am I lonely for lonesome love?
Why am I lonely for lonesome love?
Why am I lonely?

"Remember My Name"

I gave too much of my heart tonight
Can you come to where I'm staying and make some extra love?
That I can save 'til tomorrow's show

'Cause I need somebody to remember my name
After all that I can do for them is done
I need someone to remember me

I need something bigger than the sky
Hold it in my arms and know it's mine
Just how many stars will I need to hang around me
To finally call it heaven?

I need somebody to remember my name
After all that I can do for them is done
I need someone to remember me

I need something bigger than the sky
Hold it in my arms and know it's mine
Just how many stars will I need to hang around me
To finally get somewhere I can be all done
Somewhere like heaven

"Me And My Husband"

I steal a few breaths from the world for a minute
And then I'll be nothing forever
And all of my memories
And all of the things I have seen will be gone
With my eyes, with my body, with me

But me and my husband
We are doing better
It's always been just him and me
Together
So I bet all I have on that
Furrowed brow
And at least in this lifetime
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We're sticking together

And I'm the idiot with the painted face
In the corner, taking up space
But when he walks in, I am loved, I am loved

Me and my husband
We are doing better
It's always been just him and me
Together
So I bet all I have on that
Furrowed brow
And at least in this lifetime
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We are doing better

"Come Into The Water"

Come into the water!
Do you wanna be my baby?
Are you waiting to touch me?
You look so good, but I keep my hands
'Til you come into the water

Maybe I'm the same as all those men
Writing songs of all they're dreaming
But would you tell me if you want me?
'Cause I can't move until you show me

I didn't know I had a dream
I didn't know until I saw you
So would you tell me if you want me?
'Cause I can't move until you show me

"Nobody"

My God, I'm so lonely
So I open the window
To hear sounds of people
To hear sounds of people

Venus, planet of love
Was destroyed by global warming
Did its people want too much too?
Did its people want too much?

And I don't want your pity
I just want somebody near me
Guess I'm a coward
I just want to feel alright

And I know no one will save me
I just need someone to kiss
Give me one good honest kiss
And I'll be alright

Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody, nobody

I've been big and small and
Big and small and
Big and small again
And still nobody wants me
Still nobody wants me

And I know no one will save me
I'm just asking for a kiss
Give me one good movie kiss
And I'll be alright

Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, no

"Pink In The Night"

I glow pink in the night in my room
I've been blossoming alone over you
And I hear my heart breaking tonight
I hear my heart breaking tonight
Do you hear it too?
It's like a summer shower
With every drop of rain singing
"I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you!"

I could stare at your back all day
I could stare at your back all day
And I know I've kissed you before, but
I didn't do it right
Can I try again, try again, try again
Try again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again?

"A Horse Named Cold Air"

A lake with no fish
Is the heart of a horse
Named Cold Air
Who, when young
Would run like a storm
They would say

I thought I'd traveled a long way
But I had circled
The same old sin

"Washing Machine Heart"

Toss your dirty shoes in my washing-machine heart
Baby, bang it up inside
I'm not wearing my usual lipstick
I thought maybe we would kiss tonight
Baby, will you kiss me already, and
Toss your dirty shoes in my washing-machine heart
Baby, bang it up inside

Baby, though I've closed my eyes
I know who you pretend I am
I know who you pretend I am

But do mi ti
Why not me?
Why not me?
Do mi ti
Why not me?
Why not me?
Do mi ti
Why not me?
Why not me?

"Blue Light"

Somebody kiss me, I'm going crazy
I'm walking 'round the house naked
Silver in the night
Singing, "Do-do, do-do..."

Out there I'm a sharp knife
Are you that blue light?
Are you that blue light?
Are you that blue light?
Are you?

"Do-do, do-do..."

"Two Slow Dancers"

Does it smell like a school gymnasium in here?
It's funny how they're all the same
It's funny how you always remember
And we've both done it all a hundred times before
It's funny how I still forgot

It would be a hundred times easier
If we were young again
But as it is
And it is
We're just two slow dancers, last ones out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out

And the ground has been slowly pulling us back down
You see it on both our skin
We get a few years and then it wants us back

It would be a hundred times easier
If we were young again
But as it is
And it is
To think that we could stay the same
To think that we could stay the same
To think that we could stay the same
But we're two slow dancers, last ones out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out
Two slow dancers, last ones out

"Valentine, Texas"

Let's step carefully into the dark
Once we're in, I'll remember my way around
Who will I be tonight
Who will I become tonight
I'll show you who my sweetheart's never met
Wet teeth, shining eyes
Glimmering by a fire

Let's drive out to where dust devils are made
By dancing ghosts as they kick up clouds of sand
Where clouds look like mountains
Clouds look like mountains
Let me watch those mountains from underneath
And maybe they'll finally float off of me

"Working For The Knife"

I cry at the start of every movie
I guess 'cause I wish I was making things too
But I'm working for the knife

I used to think I would tell stories
But nobody cared for the stories I had about
No good guys

I always knew the world moves on
I just didn't know it would go without me
I start the day high and it ends so low
'Cause I'm working for the knife

I used to think I'd be done by 20
Now at 29 the road ahead appears the same
Though maybe at 30 I'll see a way to change
That I'm living for the knife

I always thought the choice was mine
And I was right but I just chose wrong
I start the day lying and end with the truth
That I'm dying for the knife

"Stay Soft"

Fury, pure and silver
You grip it tight inside
Like a knife
It glints in your eye

It's why I've arrived, your sex god
Here to take you where
You need to go
To where the dark remembers you

Open up your heart
Like the gates of hell

You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up

I am face down on my bed
Still not quite awake yet
Thinking of you
I tuck my hand under my weight

Just tell me what you want to do
Tell me what you want
To burn away
'Cause I could be your stoker

Open up your heart
Like the gates of hell

You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up

You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up

Only natural to harden up

"Everyone"

Everyone, all of them
Everyone said don't go that way
So, of course, to that I said
I think I'll go that way

And I left the door open to the dark
I said come in, come in, whatever you are
But it didn't want me yet

Then like a babe in a crib
After some big hand turns out the light
And I opened my arms wide to the dark
I said take it all, whatever you want
I didn't know that I was young
I didn't know what it would take
I didn't know what it would take

Sometimes I think I am free
Until I find I'm back in line again

"Heat Lightning"

Heat lightning
Running outside the window
I've laid awake since 1:00 and, now, it's 4 o'clock
Though I've held on
Can't carry it much longer
On the ceiling dancing are the things all come and gone

And there's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
So, I give it up to you
I hope that's okay
There's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
I give it up to you
I surrender

Heat lightning
Watch it from my doorstep
Sleeping eyelid of the sky
Flutters in a dream
Well I've held on
But feel a storm approaching
Trees are swaying in the wind like sea anemones

And there's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
Can I give it up to you?
Would that be okay?
There's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
I give it up to you
I surrender

There's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
I give it up to you
I surrender

"The Only Heartbreaker"

If you would just make one mistake
What a relief that would be
But I think for as long as we're together
I'll be the only heartbreaker

I'll be the only heartbreaker
I'll be the only heartbreaker

So I'll be the loser in this game
I'll be the bad guy in the play
I'll be the water main that's burst and flooding
You'll be by the window, only watching

I'll be the only heartbreaker
I'll be the only heartbreaker

(I apologize)
(You forgive me)
(I apologize)
(You forgive me)

And make me the only heartbreaker
So I'll be the only heartbreaker

"Love Me More"

If I keep myself at home
I won't make the same mistake
That I made for fifteen years
I could be a new girl
I will be a new girl

I wish that this would go away
But when I'm done singing this song
I will have to find something else
To do to keep me here
Something else to keep me here

Here's my hand
There's the itch
But I'm not supposed to scratch

I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to fill me up
Fill me up, fill me full up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to drown it out
Drown it out, drown me out

How do other people live?
I wonder how they keep it up?
When today is finally done
There's another day to come
Then another day to come
Then another day to

Come back to mine
We'll pretend it ends tomorrow

I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to fill me up
Fill me up, fill me full up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to drown it out
Drown it out, drown me out

I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to clean me up
Clean me up, clean me up
Clean me up, clean me up
Clean me up, clean me up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more

"There's Nothing Left Here For You"

There's nothing left for you
Nothing in this room
Try and go outside
Nothing waits for you

You had it once before
Not anymore
So go on to that sweetheart's door
And find a new you

Give her all the love
You saved for it

You could touch fire
You could fly
It was your right
It was your life

And then it passed
To someone new
It'll keep passing on
Long after you

But you're the only one
She's counting on

There's nothing left for you

"Should've Been Me"

Well I went through my list of friends and found
I had no one to tell
Of this overwhelming clean feeling
Strange serenity

When I saw the girl looked just like me
And it broke my heart, the lengths you went
To hold me
To get to have me, 'cause

I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
So you went into your memory
Relived all the ways you still want me
I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
I'm sorry it should've been me

I'd be going 'bout my day until a hand
Would come and lift me out
And drop me in the middle of a labyrinth
Where I'd be stuck a while

When I saw the girl looked just like me, I thought
Must be lonely loving someone
Trying to find their way out of a maze
Oh I know

I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
So you went into your memory
Relived all the ways you still want me
I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
I'm sorry it should've been me
I'm sorry it should've been me

"I Guess"

I guess, I guess
I guess this is the end
I'll have to learn
To be somebody else

It's been you and me
Since before I was me
Without you I don't yet know
Quite how to live

If I could keep
Anything of you
I would keep
Just this quiet after you

It's still as a pond
I am staring into
From here I can say
Thank you
From here I can tell you
Thank you

"That's Our Lamp"

We fought again
I ran out the apartment
You say you love me
I believe you do
But I walk down and up and down
And up and down this street
'Cause you just don't like me
Not like you used to

That's our lamp
It shines like a big moon
We may be ending
I'm standing in the dark
Looking up into our room
Where you'll be waiting for me
Thinking that's where you loved me
That's where you loved me

Thinking that's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me

"Glide (Lily Chou-Chou)"

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like a melody
Just like a simple sound
Like in harmony

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like the sky
Just fly so far away
To another place

To be away from all
To be one
Of everything

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like the wind
Just flowing in the air
Through an open space

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like the sea
Just swaying in the water
So to be at ease

To be away from all
To be one
Of everything

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like a melody
Just like a simple sound
Like in harmony

"Bug Like An Angel"

There's a bug like an angel
Stuck to the bottom
Of my glass, with a little bit left
As I got older
I learned I'm a drinker
Sometimes a drink feels like family
Family

Hey, what's the matter?
Lookin' like your sticker
Is stuck on a floor somewhere
Did you go and make promises you can't keep?
Well, when you break them
They break you right back
Amateur mistake
You can take it from me
They break you right back
Break you right back

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

When I'm bent over
Wishin' it was over
Makin' all variety of vows I'll never keep
I try to remember
The wrath of the devil
Was also given him by God
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

"Buffalo Replaced"

Mosquitoes can enjoy me, I can't go inside
I'm suckin' up as much of the full moon, so bright
Fireflies zoomin' through the yard like highway cars
Someone out here burnin' something, kids feelin' alive

Freight train stampedin' through my backyard
It'll run across the plains like the new buffalo replaced

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I have a hope and though she's blind with no name
She shits where she's supposed to, feeds herself while I'm away
Sometimes I think it would be easier without her
But I know nothing can hurt me when I see her sleepin' face

Freight train horn howlin' out mad and wild
Headin' somewhere far away like the new buffalo replaced

Oooh, ahhh
Ooh, ooh

"Heaven"

All of our love
Fillin' all of our room
Your low warm voice
Curses as you find the string
To strike within me
That rings out a note
Heard in heaven

Heaven
Heaven

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Now I bend like a willow
Thinkin' of you
Like a murmurin' brook
Curvin' about you
As I sip on the rest of the coffee you left
A kiss left of you

Heaven
Heaven
Heaven

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Hear the storm
Dances outside
Something set free
Is runnin' through the night
And the dark awaits us
All around the corner
But here in our place
We have for the day
Can we stay awhile and listen for

Heaven
Heaven

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

"I Don't Like My Mind"

I don't like my mind, I don't like being left alone in a room
With all its opinions about the things that I've done
So, yeah, I blast music loud, and I work myself to the bone
And on an inconvenient Christmas, I eat a cake

A whole cake, all for me
Ooh, aah

And then I get sick and throw up and there's another memory that gets stuck
Inside the walls of my skull waiting for its turn to talk
And it may be a few years, but you can bet it's there, waiting still
For me to be left alone in a room full of things that I've done

A whole cake, so please don't take
Take this job from me
A whole cake, so please don't take
Take my job from me

"The Deal"

There's a deal you can make on a midnight walk alone
Look around, listen close, hear it fall from above
It will ask what you'd give and what you'd take for it in return
I once went on such walk and I found that I'd said

I want someone to take this soul
I can't bear to keep it
I'd give it just to give
And all I will take are the consequences
Will somebody take this soul?

Then, of course, nothing replied, nothing speaks to you in the night
And I walked my way home, there was no one in sight
Save a bird perched upon a streetlight, watchin' me
So, I stopped and let it watch 'til I found that it said

Now I'm taken, the night has me
You won't hear me singin'
You're a cage without me
Your pain is eased but you'll never be free, for
Now I'm taken, the night has me

There's a deal that I made
There's a deal that I made
There's a deal that I made
There's a deal

"When Memories Snow"

When memories snow
And cover up the driveway
I shovel all those memories
Clear the path to drive to the store
And when memories melt
I hear them in the drainpipe
Drippin' through the downspout
As I lie awake in the dark

And if I break
Could I go on break?
Be back in my room
Writin' speeches in my head
Listenin' to the thousand hands
That clap for me in the dark

"My Love Mine All Mine"

Moon, a hole of light
Through the big top tent up high
Here before and after me
Shinin' down on me
Moon, tell me if I could
Send up my heart to you?
So, when I die, which I must do
Could it shine down here with you?

'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine

My baby here on earth
Showed me what my heart was worth
So, when it comes to be my turn
Could you shine it down here for her?

'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine
Nothing in the world is mine for free
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine

"The Frost"

The frost, it looks like dust
Settled on the world
After everyone's long been gone
But me, I was hidin', or forgotten
The only one left
Now the world is mine alone
With no one, no one to share the memory
Of frost out the window this morning
After you're gone
And the house is mine alone

You're my best friend
Now I've no one to tell
How I lost my best friend
The frost, it looks
Like we've been left in the attic
But you're not here to see
It's just witness-less me

"Star"

Remember when we met
We acted like two fools
We were so glad
So glad to have found it

That love is like a star, it's gone
We just see it shining
It's traveled very far, I'll
Keep a leftover light burning
So you can keep looking up
Isn't that worth holding on

You know I'd always been alone
Till you taught me
To live for somebody

That love is like a star
It's gone, we just see it shining
'Cause it's traveled very far, I'll
Keep a leftover light burning
So you can keep looking up
I am yours

No matter that love's gone
We just see it shining
We've traveled very far, I'll
Keep a leftover light burning
So you can keep looking up
Isn't that worth holding on

"I'm Your Man"

You're an angel, I'm a dog
Or you're a dog and I'm your man
You believe me like a God
I destroy you like I am

I'm sorry I'm the one you love
No-one will ever love me like you again
So when you leave me, I should die
I deserve it, don't I?

I can feel it getting near
Like flashlights coming down the way
One day you'll figure me out
I'll meet judgement by the hounds

People always gave me love
Others were never to blame after all
You believe me like a God
I betray you like a man

"I Love Me After You"

Hmm
Hmm
Hmm

Brushin' my hair naked
Spritz my face with toner
Splash water on my neck
Laughin' in the mirror
Cool water in a glass
Drink it down
How I love me after you
King of all the land

Stride through the house naked
Don't even care that the
Curtains are open
Let the darkness see me
Streets are mine, the night is mine
All my own
How I love me after you
King of all the land
I'm king of all the land

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

"Between The Breaths"
(from "How to Talk to Girls at Parties" soundtrack)

As you look to the stars
Oh, you could find
Illuminated in scars
A face aligned
I am saving the space
Between the breaths
I am making your place
Between the breaths

As the flame is to snow
First love to last
I will laugh in your face
Like shattered glass
I'm saving the space
Between the breaths
We are saving a place
Between the breaths

Between the breaths
Between the breaths
Between the breaths
Between the breaths
I've seen it
Oh, and I'll breathe it
I've seen it
Oh, and I'll breathe it
(Between the breaths)

I never said where I came from
You never asked what I was made of
You didn't need to know
You already know
I said it even so
You didn't need to know
You never said you couldn't see me
Never a hint you couldn't be me
I could never say
I didn't need to say
Now I'm fine although
It was touch-and-go

Counting the breaths
Until you
Oh, la la
Oh, la la
Oh, la la
Oh, la la

The distance between us
Solved by a shrug
Just a shrug of dark matter
Just a shrug of dark matter

You thought you saw a new star
You caught a fright
You think you wish you may
You wish you might
Be saving the space
Between the breaths
We are saving a place
Between the breaths

I've seen it
Oh, and I'll breathe it
I've seen it
Oh, and I'll breathe it
Between the breaths
Between the breaths
Between the breaths

You never said you couldn't see me
Never a hint you couldn't be me
I could never say
I didn't need to say
I said it even though
You didn't need to know

A sky full of messages
Sealed up in bottles
Smash the omens
Our days are not numbered
Scream in my mouth
I'll barely hear you

Flame to snow
First love to last
Brand on brow
First love to now
Questions posed
Uncut the throat
You don't have to ask
First love to last

Let's meet at the same time
Every night
Starlight on skin
Is a million years old
You never asked my age.
You never questioned my rage
Let's meet at the same time
Every morning
The blood in my gut
Is a thousand years old
But you are the sweetest infection
You are the sweetest infection

I could never know
I didn't need to know
You said it even though
You could never know

Oh, no no oh
Oh, no no oh
Oh, no no oh
