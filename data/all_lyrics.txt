"Hey L.A."

First time I saw you
I was kinda taken by surprise
You were, sun kissed, so full of bliss
You really had me mesmerized

And now it's something about the way
You do where you knock me off my feet
I'm lost inside of you
And I don't think I can leave

You already had me at "hello"
I said 'Hey L.A.'
It's really really nice to meet ya,
If it's okay I think I'll stay
Cause I just want to have some fun

Top down just chilling on the west side
Hands up get ready for a good time
'Hey L.A.'
It's really really nice to meet ya

Will somebody pinch me now
Cause it kinda feels like a dream
I got shades on my head, my feet in the sand
Ain't worried 'bout a thing

When the sun goes down
And the lights come on
You got me feeling just like a star
And no matter where I go
You'll always have my heart

You already had me at "hello"...
I said "Hey L.A."
It's really really nice to meet ya,
If it's okay I think I'll stay
Cause I just want to have some fun

Top down just chilling on the west side
Hands up get ready for a good time
'Hey L.A.'
It's really really nice to meet ya

Now if you can make it here
You can make it anywhere
And it's not always easy
But there's no place that I'd rather be

I said "Hey L.A."
It's really really nice to meet ya,
If it's okay I think I'll stay
Cause I just want to have some fun

Top down just chilling on the west side
Hands up get ready for a good time
'Hey L.A.'
It's really really nice to meet ya

Na na na na
L.A.
It's really really nice to meet ya
Cause I just wanna have some fun
Top down just chilling on the west side
Hands up get ready for a good time

Hey L.A.
It's really really cool to be here yeah

I'll meet you at In-N-Out
And let's go to the beach
I'm in L.A...

"Like Me Or Not"

I don't care if you walk right by me with another guy see I got plenty of time,
Plenty of time...yeah,
You can blow me off, it won't make a differance, I won't listen, no changing it's mine,
No changing, it's mine.

Sometimes you look, right, through,
But all I see, is, all I see is you...yeah,

I'm kind of like a train that just won't stop,
Trying to put the key inside the lock,
Girl I'm gonna like you, like you, like me or not,
I ain't ever gonna lose this plot,
Waiting for you to connect the dots,
Girl I'm gonna like you, like you, like me or not,
Like me or not.

I don't care if you lose my number, ain't gonna crumble, ain't gonna fall to the floor,
I always got more...yeah,
You can tell all your friends that I'm not your type, but if you don't try me, how can you be sure,
Well how can you be sure.

Sometimes you look right through,
But all I see is, all I see is you...yeah.

I'm kind of like a train that just won't stop,
Trying to put the key inside the lock,
Girl I'm gonna like you, like you, like me or not,
I ain't ever gonna lose this plot,
Waiting for you to connect the dots,
Girl I'm gonna like you, like you, like me or not,
Like me or not.

Sometimes you just know,
That you shouldn't let go.
I'm kinda like a train that just won't stop, stop, stop,
Girl I'm gonna like you, like you, like me or not.

I ain't ever gonna lose this plot,
Waiting for you to connect the dots,
Girl I'm gonna like you, like you, like me or not.

"Give Myself A Try"

I looked in the mirror and realised,
I can be the one, be the one to change the world
Even though it seems impossible, sometimes
And I'm like maybe, just maybe,
Even though I'm not first place at the finish line,
I still won a prize inside, I tried.

Now I can't do everything, no.
I'm still gonna try, gonna try my best,
But I will do anything, yeah,
Anything for this dream of mine, yeah.

I'm gonna give myself a try,
Oh Oh Oh Oh,
My aim is to win,
So I'm gonna rise,
I promise to live,
Until the day I die,
I gotta give myself a try.

People try to, try to bring me down,
But no matter what, I'm never gonna ever change,
No matter what they try to say, to me,
I'm a winner, not a quitter,
And that is just the way that it's always gonna be,
That it's gonna be, gonna be.

Now I can't do everything, no.
I am still gonna try, gonna try my best,
But I will do anything, yeah,
Anything for this dream of mine, yeah.

I'm gonna give myself a try,
Oh Oh Oh Oh,

"Every Little Thing"

Hey oh, I saw you walkin' by my way so
I thought I would come over and say hello
To you right now
But when I tried to speak the words won't come out
It's you girl, it's definetly something you do girl
That's got my heart beating over time
When you're around
It's like you lift me up and I can come back down
I used to keep my feelings all to me
But now my heart's right on my sleeve for all to see

Because I, I want to be
Every little thing that you want,
That you need, that you breathe
And I know it might sound crazy
I think that it's amazing what you do to me
Oh maybe this could truly be
That I'm in love, in love, in love
Oh I'm in love, in love, in love

Oh you're my sunlight
You're my everything's going to be alright
The only thing I need in my life
From day to night my troubles disappear when you hold me tight
And I know I'll never find another like you
So I promise that I'll never let you go
You're all I need, 'cause baby without you I'm just not me

If this is somehow just all a dream
Then please just let me stay
Oh I just want to stay asleep

Because I, I want to be
Every little thing that you want,
That you need, that you breathe
And I know it might sound crazy
I think that it's amazing what you do to me
Oh maybe this could truly be
That I'm in love, in love, in love
Oh I'm in love, in love, in love

And if the stars fall from the sky
I'll pick them up for you, baby
'Cause you're the only reason why I wake up in the morning, baby
And it might sound a little too forward for me to say, but I'ma do it anyway
'Cause I think that this could mean, girl
That I, I want to be every little thing that you want,
That you need, that you breathe

And I know it might sound crazy
I think that it's amazing what you do to me
Oh maybe this could truly be
That I'm in love, in love, in love
Oh I'm in love, in love, in love
[x18]

"Simple Song"

It's just another lazy summer afternoon,
Summer breeze blowing into my bedroom
Before I even put my feet on the floor,
I start strumming the chords on my guitar,
It's just a C sharp minor, to the B major,
It sounds kinda like the summer breeze to me,
And it makes me want to sing.

It ain't complicated,
Just a little syncopating,
Maybe it's understated but I like it, I like it, oh.

It's just a simple song,
It's not gonna hurt if you sing along,
Maybe if it moves you, you can dance,
Cause all you really really want,
Is a tune you can hum till the break of dawn,
And everybody knows that it's the jam,
And it goes a little something like,
Lalalalalalaa,
It's just a simple song,
Lalalalalalaa,
Everybody sing along,
Lalalalalalaa, lalalala, yeah.

It's just another crazy Friday night,
All my friends hanging on the beach round the bonfire,
Someone writing on guitar, and they knew the chord.
It's just a C sharp minor, to the B major,
It sounds really good with the ocean waves,
And it makes everybody sing.

It ain't complicated,
Just a little syncopating,
Maybe it's understated but I like it, I like it, oh.

It's just a simple song,
It's not gonna hurt if you sing along,
Maybe if it moves you, you can dance,
Cause all you really really want,
Is a tune you can hum till the break of dawn,
And everybody knows that it's the jam,
And it goes a little something like,
Lalalalalalaa,
It's just a simple song,
Lalalalalaa,
Everybody sing along,
Lalalalalalaa, lalalala, yeah,
Lalalalala, it's just a simple song.

Ooooh, yeah, yeah. Oh.
It's just a simple song, oh yeah.
Ooh.

It's just another simple song,
It still sounds good if you sing it wrong,
Maybe you can move so you can dance,
Cause all you really really want is a tune you can sing till the break of dawn,
And everybody knows that it's the jam,
And it goes a little something like,
Lalalalalalaa, 3 chords and a melody,
Lalalalalaa, it's just a simple song,
Lalalalalalaa, lalalalalaa,
Lalalalalaa, and this is my simple song.

"Pretending"

Time, time is what you said that you were needing, away from me,
But I, I guess that I was too far in the distance, to even see,
The things between us now,
Just haven't quite been the same,
Can we figure out, which one of us is to blame,
'Cause I can't go on.

And Oh,
Why are we pretending
Why are we just wasting time, on a love that isn't real
Because if you don't want me,
You should just tell me now,
So I can save these tears.

You, you said that you would never,
Ever hurt me but I guess that was a lie,
'Cause it's killing me to watch you stay
When I, I know this is goodbye,
And it's hard for me to think,
That maybe this is the end, you were my heart,
Baby you were my bestfriend, but we can't go on.

And Oh,
Why are we pretending
Why are we just wasting time on a love that isn't real
Because if you don't want me,
You should just tell me now, so I can save these tears.

We tried to make it work but we just can't make it last,
We need to move on, stop living in the past,
And I'll even even know, how our love got so strange,
It's not the same.

And Oh,
Why are we pretending
Why are we just wasting time, on a love that isn't real
Because if you don't want me, you should just tell me now,
So I can save these tears.
Let me save these tears

"Love Will Come My Way"

She'll be shining
Where's she hiding
Love will come my way
Sometimes I'm up
And sometimes I'm down
And I'm wondering if things are ever gonna turn around
One thing I know
Time changes all
And I spend most of mine just waiting for my turn to fall

Falling so hard for someone
When is that time gonna come

Like a bright light, she'll be shining
Tonight, where's she hiding
When the time's right
Love will come my way
Guess I'll keep on waiting
While she hesitating
When the time's right
Love will come my way
Love will come my wa-ay a-a-a-ay
wa-ay a-a-a-ay, wa-ay a-a-a-ay
Love will come my way

Everyone I see
They all got someone
Well me, I got no one
No one for me
Yeah I don't sweat it
But I just don't get it
There must be somebody
Out there for me

There'll be a time and a place
I'll know her when I'll see her face

Like a bright light
She'll be shining
Tonight, where's she hiding
When the time's right
Love will come my way
Guess I'll keep on waiting
While she hesitating
When the time's right
Love will come my way
Love will come my wa-ay a-a-a-ay
wa-ay a-a-a-ay, wa-ay a-a-a-ay
Love will come my way

Guess I'll keep on waiting
While she hesitating
When the time's right
Love will come my way
Love will come my
Wo-o wo-o-o-o-o wo-o
Wo-o wo-o-o-o-o wo-o
Wo-o wo-o-o-o-o wo-o
Love will come my way
Wo-o wo-o-o-o-o wo-o
Wo-o wo-o-o-o-o wo-o
Wo-o wo-o-o-o-o wo-o
Love will come my way

Like a bright light
She'll be shining
Tonight, where's she hiding
When the time's right
Love will come my way
Guess I'll keep on waiting
While she hesitating
When the time's right
Love will come my way
Love will come my wa-ay a-a-a-ay
wa-ay a-a-a-ay, wa-ay a-a-a-ay
Love will come my way
Wa-ay a-a-a-ay
wa-ay a-a-a-ay, wa-ay a-a-a-ay
Love will come my way
Like a bright light
She'll be shining
Tonight, where's she hiding
When the time's right
Love will come my way

"Could've Had Love"

We were burnin' up like a Summer love
Now you're telling me
That what we got ain't good enough
You don't want me 
You don't need me
Too bad, so sad
Enough with that
Ain't it funny
You were telling me
You'd never leave
Now you're telling me
That you're onto better things
This is farewell
This is goodbye
I'll be just fine
I'll be alright

When you show up asking me to come back
I'll be telling you

Girl you could've had 
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
But you're the one who walked away
So let me give it to you straight
Could've had
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
What we had was hard to find
But you want to leave it all behind
And that's okay

Girl you never miss a good thing 'till its gone
Now this good thing is moving on
I don't want ya
I don't need ya
So long, so done
You're not the one
And I hope you don't take it too personal
When you sing along to this on the radio
Every lyric, can you hear it
The words are mine we had our time

When you show up asking me to come back
I'll be telling you

Girl you could've had 
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
But you're the one who walked away
So let me give it to you straight
Could've had
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
What we had was hard to find
But you want to leave it all behind
And that's okay

You can do whatever makes you happy
We'll tell you to stay
We'll stand in the way
I'll tell you'll be okay (my baby)
The future is right infront of you
Infront of you, yeah
Infront of you

Girl you could've had 
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
But you're the one who walked away

And that's okay

Oh, oh, oh
That's okay
I'm gonna be back
That's okay
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
And that's okay

"Underdogs"

Start from the beginning
Feels like it was yesterday
The best of my friends stay
The rest of em' fade away

Now there's nothing but green lights
The reason we stand in place
So time doesn't miss me
I move at a faster pace

Don't care what they say
They'll never change us (underdogs)
We live for today
And no one can blame us (Underdogs)

'Cause when you're the underdog,
They never get down,
All they do is stop and stare,
Under the surface,
We got a purpose,
We are the Underdogs

When you fall down, get up,
Then you'll be right back,
on track, on track

What is perception
Its just a reflection of who i am
At school you were so cool
Now you're just a grown fool
These kids can be so cruel

Yeah, Yeah

Don't care what they say
They'll never change us (underdogs)
We live for today
And no one can blame us (Underdogs)

'Cause when you're the underdog,
They never get down,
All they do is stop and stare,
Under the surface,
We got a purpose,
We are the Underdogs

No I can't look down (underdog)
If i could do it again (underdog)
I wouldn't change a thing (underdog)
I'm living out my dreams, yeah
And I'm so close,
 I came too far to turn back now,
The world is at my feet
I know my destiny,
mission complete

Don't care what they say
They'll never change us (underdogs)
We live for today
And no one can blame us (Underdogs)

'Cause when you're the underdog,
They never get down,
All they do is stop and stare,
Under the surface,
We got a purpose,
We are the Underdogs

When you fall down, get up
You're just a beginning 
You're still just pretending
Then you'll be right back
on track, on track

When you fall down, get up
You're just a beginning 
You're still just pretending
Then you'll be right back
on track, on track

"Chameleon"

When the lights fade out
And the people go
I get to see a secret side of you no one has seen before
When we're all alone

Your colors always change
You never act the same with me
Chameleon
It's like you disappeared
There's someone else right here with me
Chameleon
I look into your eyes
And I don't recognize
The one who's sweet with me when nobody's around
Chameleon

Later with a crowd
You start acting differently
It's impossible to figure out what you're in this for
And what you want from me

Your colors always change
You never act the same with me
Chameleon
It's like you disappeared
There's someone else right here with me
Chameleon
I look into your eyes
And I don't recognize
The one who's sweet with me when nobody's around
Chameleon

Your colors always change
You never act the same with me
Chameleon
It's like you disappeared
There's someone else right here with me
Chameleon
I look into your eyes
And I don't recognize
The one who's sweet with me when nobody's around
Chameleon

"Haircut"

Wake me up when the days are over
Reminiscing of a life I had
I smile on and feel the closure
I finally feel like me again
Sacrifice, the sweet attention
You have to give before you get
Another lie, another lie
I'll get it right

It starts right now
Now
It starts right now
Right now
Oh I can never ever ever ever lose it
It's all I ever ever ever ever wanted, oh woah

Control myself, realized I couldn't
Too special to stay on the track
They look the same, I tried to fake it
But it left a bad taste in my mouth
I know I sound better when I'm nervous (yup)
But honestly I can't complain (no)
I feel alive, I really can, oh yes I can

It starts right now
Now
It starts right now
Right now
Oh I can never ever ever ever lose it
It's all I ever ever ever ever wanted, oh woah

Run home
Get back to where you came from
Don't be so afraid, no
This is what you're meant for
Run home
Get back to where you came from
Don't be so afraid, no
This is what you're meant for

"Euro"

You know, it's a free world
You can leave when you want
Take the money and run, run, run to me
Freeway, it's a free world
You can leave when you want
Take the money and run, run, run to me
Who are you when I'm not around
Who are you when I'm not around
White lines, you've been working all the time
Need to cool you down
I've been on the sidelines and I watch it fall apart

All my cash is in Euros
All my coins are in Yen
All my boys European
All my money is gone

Don't wanna rent cars, I wanna crash cars
I'm feeling NASCAR in mom and dad's car
I'm not suicidal, I'm too afraid to die
Wanna feel something other than sadness sometimes
Damn
I can't relate to the people who relate to me
Always late to the party that I don't wanna be
Can't trust them anyway, can't trust them anyway
They don't see me for me

You are special to me
You are special to me
You are special to me
You are special to me
You are special to me
You are special to me

I'll subtract all the gold
Reach a couple of goals
Take a trip to the bridge
See what it's really worth
All my cash is in Euros
All my coins are in Yen
All my boys European
All my money is gone

"Cupid"

Pitch black
I'm on the opposite side of the fence
Sneaking out for a kiss, yeah
Just to tell you I like you
There ain't nobody like you

Who you gonna dance with
Who you gonna dance with
Who you gonna dance with

He's the only one on my mind
He's the only one I call when I'm feeling reckless
Tell me that you're mine
Open up your heart for a minute
Let me see the things you got hiding in it

Cupid got us fucked up
Drawing hearts on my skin
Throwing issues in there
Ain't it nice out here
on the baseball field
when we're alone
Press your lips against my neck
With me you don't pretend that you're with your girlfriend
She's nice but she's not me
She's nice but hates me
Date me, I'm just playing
Didn't mean to say that
Sometimes kids say the dumbest things
But if you're down, so am I
I can't lie

Who you gonna dance with
Who you gonna dance with
Who you gonna dance with

He's the only one on my mind
He's the only one I call when I'm feeling reckless
Tell me that you're mine
Open up your heart for a minute
Let me see the things you got hiding in it

What do you want from me
What do you want from me
I'll give it to you, you just gotta ask, yeah
What do you want from me
What do you want from me
I'll give it to you, you just gotta ask

And when we get older
And y'all break up someday
And this is not a secret
Maybe then you'll say you love me back
But until then I'll be dreaming about that

"Bruise"

This is not real, this is a memory
A real memory

Super star, I wanna feel you shine on me

And he dances, and he dances, and he dances
That's my man
And he dances, and he dances, and he dances
That's my man

I went to a dance with my high school girlfriend
Left from a dance without my high school girlfriend
Give me the chance and I could read you the stories
Burning the books because life fucking bores me
So she's out there slow dancing to the song
And we're in the boys bathroom, making out, yeah

Super star, I wanna feel you shine on me
I wanna feel you shine
Super star, I wanna feel you shine on me

"Camo"

Why I got this gel in my hair for no reason
Sitting in my bedroom with my headphones bleeding
Staring at my posters of these Japanese women
Dreaming of a day when it's worth what I'm seeing
Should I get my trophies out the box
Should I hang my ribbons even though I lost
Cross country was that fastest on the team
Cross country when I was only seventeen
Now the only thing I got are these memories
And a lot of time on my hands

Camo print depression
I keep my feelings hidden
No pills, no feels
I'm not used to winning, but that's life
That's life
Camo print depression
I keep my feelings hidden
No pills, no feels
I'm not used to winning, but that's life
That's life

What's gonna be my reputation
[] close to the bunk bed
One on top and one on the bottom
Is that a Flip Cam
(Yeah man)
I got two
(Oh shoot)
One for the B-roll
And one for the docs
Cause that must mean nothing to me
My mama saw me on TV
Said she didn't recognize me

Mama saw me on TV
I'm not saying I'm a ride or die
Mama saw me on TV
Who to say what's wrong or right
Mama saw me on TV
Mama saw me on TV
Mama saw me on TV
Mama turn the TV off

Camo print depression
I keep my feelings hidden
No pills, no feels
I'm not used to winning, but that's life

Camo print depression
I keep my feelings hidden
No pills, no feels
I'm not used to winning, but that's life

"Party's Over"

You've been on my mind
And I wonder if you will ever be mine
I'd like that
You've been on my mind
And I wonder if you will ever be mine
I like that

When you walk in
The room stops talking
The boys are flocking
They want you
Keep my distance
'Cause you're with him
Make a decision
Is he your lover or boyfriend

Party's over
Wishing on a
Four-leaf clover
You'll come over
When we roll like this

Party's over
Wishing on a
Four leaf clover

When we roll like this

We could be friends
We could be more than friends if you want to

I don't know them
They're not my friends
I just have them come over so I have a reason, to see you

You are a superstar
Seen every movie that you've been in
Let's make a movie tonight

Party's over
Wishing on a
Four-leaf clover
You'll come over
When we roll like this

Wishing on a

I don't wanna live without you
Couldn't see my life without you in it
I'd probably lose my fucking mind

I don't wanna live without you
Couldn't see my life without you in it
I'd probably lose my fucking mind

"Money"

When you've got friends
And you got that money
Honey, they're your friends until the money spent
Pay that bill
Trigger pulled too fast
Now you're driving home and you are all alone

Call me good, call me bad
Don't care what you say just call me bad
Money comes and people go
But I won't live forever
Call me good, call me bad
Don't care what you say just call me bad
People talk and walk away
But I won't live forever

I can't pay your rent today
I can't even pay attention
Been living no home for way too long
My job is driving me
I call my friends today (Hi)
I call my friends tomorrow (Bye)
I call but they're not enough
What the fuck
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
What did I do wrong
Someone else to fill my shoes
Who else are they counting on
Did they find a place without me
It can't be the same without me, without me
Without my money money money money money

When you've got friends
And you got that money (and you got that money)
Honey, they're your friends until the money spent
Pay that bill (pay that bill)
Trigger pulled too fast
Now you're driving home and you are all alone

Call me good, call me bad
Don't care what you say just call me bad
Money comes and people go
But I won't live forever
Call me good, call me bad
Don't care what you say just call me bad
People talk and walk away
But I won't live forever

Money money money money money
Money money money money money

Hmm, what's up to ya
I can see through ya
When it comes down to it
Tell me what really makes you happy
Do I make you happy
What's up to ya
I can see through ya
When it comes down to it
Tell me what really makes you happy
Do I make you happy

Do I make you happy
Do I make you happy
Money money money money money
Does my money make you happy
Do I Do I make you feel
Money money money money money

"God In Jeans"

God is real, he was sleeping in my bed last night
We were naked with the radio on
Played him favorite song

My love, he caught me crying
Freedom can die so hard
When you have a broken heart
Tears of joy
I pray to the open sky
This is the one I wanted
This is everything

Give me more, I'll be all your love
I believe in heaven above
Come and give me life
Show me what it's like to fall into your arms

God is real, he was sleeping in my bed last night
We were naked with the radio on
Played him favorite song

My love is my religion
Preaching the choir
Fueling the fire
Oh my God, you know I need ya
If I'm going to hell, I'm taking you with me
I'm taking you with me

Give me more, I'll be all your love
I believe in heaven above
Come and give me life
Show me what it's like to fall into your arms

God is real, he was sleeping in my bed last night
We were naked with the radio on
Played him favorite song
God is real, he was sleeping in my bed last night
We were naked with the radio on
Played him favorite song

So what do you think it is
I don't know, I'm totally freaked out
It's probably aliens
No it's probably the government
Totally aliens, completely coming in to invade the, the you know the world right now with everything that's going on
I would be okay with that

"Crash"

Tough tension, I'm reckless
Harmony, Corin
They hate me, they love me
I'm indifferent
I'm indifferent
[] on the handle
Jesus on my dash
Neutral colors on the centerfold
Fuck it, let's go fast

I'm gonna crash the car
I'm gonna crash the car

Two tone on the visual
Mixing colors with the grey
Bloody nose like in cinema
I don't got time for this today
I gotta pick me up a check
Get myself a gig
Look at that sunset
One sec, lemme take this pic
It's pretty

I'm gonna crash the car
I'm gonna crash the car
I'm gonna crash the car
I'm gonna crash the car

What gives at seven
That's two hours from now
You got time for me I know you do
Staying up late
My insomnia's acting up
Or I am in love with ya, I don't know
Tracing the V on your abdomen
Like Siamese twins and making me feel precious
You little treasure
I could never let go of you
Even if I tried, even if you let me
I could never survive without you, without you, without you, without you

"Powerslide"

Suburban royalty
'Cause his neighbors let us use the pool
He gave me pleasure underneath the water
And it felt so good
Now we're power sliding till the flat spots stop us
They call the cops on us
The time tick tocks, you drop me off

Summer's over when I die
Can't let go of the heat, can't let go of your hand
I roll into the deep end
'Cause I wanna feel the wind blow while I ride
Sun's up, I glisten
You're good at transition

You could pass for masculine
But that's not why I like it, no no no no
Now we share a couple cigarettes before we go to bed
And you got the plastic, that's fucking fantastic
Now we're powersliding till we can both pass out
You got the TV on, with the volume down for colors in the background

Summer's over when I die
Can't let go of the heat, can't let go of your hand
I roll into the deep end
'Cause I wanna feel the wind blow while I ride
Sun's up, I glisten
You're good at transition

Summer's over when I die
Can't let go of the heat, can't let go of your hand
Roll into the deep end
'Cause I wanna feel the wind blow while I ride
Sun's up, I glisten
You're good at transition

Get lost
His muscles flex when he takes
A puff from his cigarette
He's looking tough and so friendly
I'm im...
Get lost
Stop, I'm taking your picture
Crack a smile through the lens
My god, I swear this is perfect
Let the sunset take us down
Get lost
Ahh, ahh
Get lost
Ahh, ahh

(It's cold
Ryan could you skateboard for us)

"Speed"

You got that tattoo from your best friend in your bedroom
You let him stick and poke you
You like French fry and the Fujicam flies and gold crew
It's good to get to know you

Do you speak Japanese
Do you speak Japanese
Do you speak Japanese
Do you do speed
Do you speak Japanese
Do you speak Japanese
Do you speak Japanese
Do you do speed

I got my bleach hair and my hand-me-downs
And my Kafka tea
I saw it on the TV
Feel my pulse pump from the 808 drum
Like amphetamine
If you know what I mean

Do you speak Japanese
Do you speak Japanese
Do you speak Japanese
Do you do speed
Do you speak Japanese
Do you speak Japanese
Do you speak Japanese
Do you do speed

Baby girl is on the run
(Try sugar, no cream)
Pockets full of coins and guns
([] and a magazine)
Watch her flash her [beep] for cash
(Take the white man's money)
Slushy lips and cherry wishes, blow the candles out
(Happy birthday)
God bless America
She can use her body for whatever
Do want you want
He can use his money for whatever
God bless America
She can use her body for whatever
Do want you want
He can use his money for whatever

"Pink Floyd"

Making the money to get by
Smoking the Pink Floyd every night
And I'm feeling sad 'cause everyday
I pay the price
Taking a walk to shake it off
I'm trying to believe in what I want
I don't what else I can say
I'm made this way

They say there's nothing to lose
But I lose it everyday
They say there's nothing to lose
But I lose it everyday

I'll find a place, I'll find a place
Somewhere special
I'll find a place, I'll find a place
Somewhere special

Mom and dad moved away from home
To Santa Clarita years ago
Just so that I could catch my dream
(I owe everything)
Honestly I could really cry
I hope that I looked back on their life
And see that I tried, I tried, I tried
(I tried, I tried, I tried)

They say there's nothing to lose
But I lose it everyday
They say there's nothing to lose
But I lose it everyday

I'll find a place, I'll find a place
Somewhere special
I'll find a place, I'll find a place
Somewhere special, special
I'll find a place somewhere special
I'll find a place, I'll find a place
Somewhere special

"Flash"

Head to my chest
I promise I won't cry
Try to impress
Falling to the sky

Life flashes before my eyes
I'm not ready to say goodbye

I'm so afraid
I see you in the dark
Don't say my name
I'll probably fall apart

Days like this are the reason why
I'm not ready to say goodbye
I, I

And before you realize it I'll be gone
And before you realize it I'll be gone

Life flashes before my eyes
I'm not ready to say goodbye
I, I

- I don't like it when you don't like me
- Well I don't like it when you don't like me
- I'm glad we're agreeing
- Huh
- I said I'm glad we're agreeing

"Rhinestone"

Big boy knew a life jean jacket with the rhinestones
Cool kids said I'll never fall in love but I might though (I might though)
Got me feeling ways that I'll never feel, but I like the feel
First time, so fast, it was tight though
That's a body modification
'Cause you appear smart so

Forever changed, forever known
Going down, that's a lesson
Going up with the sky, fly, butterfly fly
Fly high

Come fly with me
There's so much more to see out there
You're the green
It's been a window right next to me

Flight down got me passing out fast from a cheap thrill
Woke up after noon, feeling good, took a Advil
But the jet lag ain't that bad, I'll get used to it (I'll get used to it)
Never seen your sky in the nighttime
That's a new area code
But you still look the same

Forever changed, forever known
Going down as a hero
Going up with the sky, fly, butterfly fly
Fly high

Come fly with me
There's so much more to see out there
You're the green
It's been a window right next to me
Come fly with me
There's so much more to see out there
You're the green
It's been a window right next to me

"In The End"

Met you in the dark and
Look how far it got us
Bawling in your arms
A camera was recording

Laughter from the patio
We were keeping quiet (all this hiding out) everything you said makes sense but I can't say goodbye yet

In the end
I believe in something I can't see
In the end
I believe in something I can't see

Sleep an hour, right up to sunday
Pull out the webcam, show off my body

I try to lay low, right below light strobes I want some touch from someone I don't know

Throw another dollar at a body builder
On me, he's on me
Wonderful, the sun is coming up now
On me, on me

In the end
I believe in something I can't see
In the end
I believe in something I can't see

I believe in something I can't see
I believe in something I can't see

Only time I find slumber
When it is you I am under

"Dark Circles"

Match me
When I tell you things
That no one knows about me
What keeps me up at night
What keeps you in my life

I left you
At a time when you were tryna get your life back
I'll probably end up somewhere in the limelight
What keeps me up at night
What keeps you in my life

I swear, if I could give you up, I would erase you
Get you out of my mind
It's all I think about
Let you go somewhere else
Try to let go, but I can't help

Alone in the clothes you let me borrow when the rain came
I'm laying down, and I can't help but daydream
Who do you idolize now
Do you ever think about me

Think about me
Think about me
Think about me

I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me
I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me

I think forever is too long
What does it mean to be loyal
I put your jacket on
To make me feel important

I think forever is too long
What does it mean to be loyal
I put your jacket on
To make me feel important

Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover

I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me
I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me
I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me
I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me
I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me

"Patchwork"

Clothes off
He needs to come through or cut me off
I understand why he hesitates

Go home
I'd rather be alone than soaked in sweat
Taking a dose to make me forget

Fell back into the hotel
Underneath the same lights
Eye contact was the last thing I wanted
While you looked like that
Jumped into the water
Let the iPhone speaker blaring
I can feel their eyesights glaring, classic
Glossed up and getting wasted
This is not my last masterpiece
I am Michelangelo

I still don't know how you feel about us
Boys in the backseat are talking about us

Cold sweat, coke head
I forgot your name in the same place last time
No thanks

Cold sweat, coke head
I forgot your name in the same place last time
No thanks

There's some men out there on the floor
Watching me lose myself to disco music

There's some men out there on the floor
Watching me lose myself to disco music

There's some men out there on the floor
Watching me lose myself to disco music

There's some men out there on the floor
Watching me lose myself to disco music

"Hawkshaw"

You walked all this way to show me signs
It was a hawkshaw song stuck in my mind
I turned my back for second
I don't know why now
You're a thousand miles out of California

Double pierce the ears
Take a stab at it, take a stab at it
Let's try to make this happen
Double pierce the ears
Take a stab at it, take a stab at it
Let's try to make this happen, yeah

You walked all this way to show me signs
It was a hawkshaw song stuck in my mind
I turned my back for second
I don't know why now
You're a thousand miles out of California

Rinse your hair in the faucet
I watch you do your thing through the screen shine
My lip glossing nobody knows we've been talking I had a couple boys
I met you, so I lost them you're so awesome

See me out your window (I'm tryna get to know you boy)
See me out your window (I'm tryna get to know you boy)
See me out your window (I'm trying trying trying trying trying)
See me out your window (are you paranoid)

"Flowers At The Door"

Our heads connected
I got the message
You had your hands around my skull

Gave in to ashes
Passed up the acid
I look up to you when I'm below

Why don't you turn me around
Why don't you turn me around
Why don't you turn me around

Draw on the pages
I won't erase it
I want your mark on me, eternal

I cast a shadow
While I stand above you
It's all I ever wanted, a turn

Why don't you turn me around
Why don't you turn me around
Why don't you turn me around

What's so wrong with wanting more
Rolling on the hardwood floor
Show me what's like below
I'll be where the herons go

"Evergreen"

It was seven or so, cause the daylight was over
You got out of the robe and into the water
We're too familiar, we're too tethered
What comes after, what comes after

If there's nothing else round the corner
If there's nothing else round the corner
We can meet up right where we left off
If there's nothing else round the corner
If there's nothing else round the corner
If there's nothing else round the corner

Throw t off me
Show skin, surely
Thought we were evergreen
Now we're just on fire
I won't know free
Til he holds me
And I don't feel pleasure
When I'm up inside

Leave fast as I can, staying back could be bad (I lose sleep)
Thought of wanting you back,
I wrestle with that (I lose sleep)
I don't know where you are
I don't know if it's bad, no answer
What comes after, what comes after

If there's nothing else round the corner
If there's nothing else round the corner
We can meet up right where we left off
If there's nothing else round the corner
If there's nothing else round the corner
If there's nothing else round the corner

If there's nothing else right here
If there's nothing left to give
We can meet up right where we left
If there's nothing else round the corner
If there's nothing else round the corner

Throw t off me
Show skin, surely
Thought we were evergreen
Now we're just on fire
I won't know free
Til he holds me
And I don't feel pleasure
When I'm up inside

Throw t off me
Show skin, surely
Thought we were evergreen
Now we're just on fire
I won't know free
Til he holds me
And I don't feel pleasure
When I'm up inside

"Genesis"

Basically an atheist, he's all that I believe in right now
The torch is out, I'm begging for the torture now
Half a stoner, practically an adolescent, insert here industrial sounds

Ever since Jerusalem, had a change of heart
You went back to genesis, found God
But not the one you were looking for
Not the one you were looking for
Not the one you were looking for
Am I the one you were looking for
Am I the one you were looking for

Erasing my intolerance to nicotine and you are quite the opposite
Lace it with what you offered me
Cured from the ivy
Roses on loan (seeing double)
Laid on a throne (peripheral)
This is on the radio, hold me tightly
Say your name out loud
That's faith, that's fate (now)

Ever since Jerusalem, had a change of heart
You went back to genesis, found God
But not the one you were looking for
Not the one you were looking for
Not the one you were looking for
Am I the one you were looking for
Am I the one you were looking for

Heavens in the room
Heavens in the room
Heavens in the room
Heavens in the room
Heavens in the room
Heavens in the room
Heaven made the rules

Heavens in the room
Heavens in the room (shine like light)
Heavens in the room
Heavens in the room (shine like light)
Heavens in the room
Heavens in the room
Heaven made the rules

"Backseat"

Sometimes I watch you drive from the backseat and I let you have your way
Switch sides with me, I got you on the way home
And you can play the radio
Reminding me to tell you something
I can't remember what you said
See you looking out the window
I wonder what you think about

You would comb my hair
Never let me down
Always let the tears run out
I wonder what you'd tell me now
Cause I need a friend who could have my back
When the lightning comes and I catch on fire

Return to where we were on the weekend
And you pull up to my yard
From paper to vaporize, let the smoke out
I can feel it in my heart
Imagine if it wasn't magic
My back is on the bedroom floor
I like it when I hear you breathing
Reminds me that I'm not alone

All my idols dead, when I have no one
I look to you for advice
What to do with my life
Half of who I am isn't all my fault
So it feels good knowing that I got somebody

"Brother"

Speeding with no hesitation
Crushed up the pills that you had
Just like the matches you're burning
To see if it all falls down

Why do you leave yourself
Leave yourself
Leave yourself alone
Why don't you ask for help when you're needing someone
I'm giving everything to get to you
I'm knocking at your door
I'm knocking at your door
If only you would let me in

Brother you can lay your head
You can lay your head on my shoulder
I see that you, you try your best to be someone that you don't want to

You know, you know you can call on me
You know, you know

Why do you leave yourself
Leave yourself
Leave yourself alone
Why don't you ask for help when you're needing someone
I'm giving everything to get to you
I'm knocking at your door
I'm knocking at your door
If only you would let me in

You are so quiet
I wonder if you cry yourself to sleep
There is a light within your eyes
If only you could see

"Casino"

I'm wide awake in the lobby of a hotel casino
An advertise of somewhere I wanted to be
The oxygen was choking like death grips around me
I even thought I couldn't be sadder than that,
I am

Hood on, hand in my pocket, walk away
Hood on, hand in my pocket, walk away

Love me to death or don't give me anything
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Love me to death or don't give me anything
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Love me to death or don't give me anything

The elderly was playing a version of your song
I asked them if they could play anything else,
But they don't
I sing along and laugh just in case of the opposite
Everything was blurry so I couldn't see
Thankfully

Hood on, hand in my pocket, walk away
(Walk away)
Hood on, hand in my pocket, walk away

Love me to death or don't give me anything
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Love me to death or don't give me anything
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Love me to death or don't give me anything

Come around like the moon, sun, most the time you're on my mind
Come around like the moon, sun, most the time you're on my mind
Come around like the moon, sun, most the time you're on my mind
Come around like the moon, sun, most the time you're on my mind

Hood on, hand in my pocket, walk away
(Walk away)
Hood on, hand in my pocket, walk away

Love me to death or don't give me anything
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Love me to death or don't give me anything
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Love me to death or don't give me anything

When I see a call from plano then I know that I'll ignore for reasons that you - in my mind it's better to fantasize, so I'll buy a pack and sit back and look at the sky

"Shimmer"

Father, father
Come home, come home, come home
Come home, come home, come home
My arms are here
My arms are here for you

You took me fishing when I was 8
Went to june lake, came face to face
With my future and a deer in the woods
Those times, so gone, so good
Those times, so gone, so good, so good

I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that

Father, father
Come home, come home, come home
Come home, come home, come home
My arms are here
My arms are here for you

I thought I was separate from nature
Now I know otherwise
I might live long enough to see myself
Dying without a child, I
I see myself in you, I
I see myself in you

I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that

I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that

I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that

I'll wake up, I'm sorry, memorize, apologize
It's alright, yeah, that's how this goes
I read that somewhere
Something you wrote me years ago

If you look deeper
See my face through the speakers
"It's magic", that's what you said
Remember when I left you crying years ago

"Dreaming Of David"

Dreaming of David
It's all in his honor
I don't want to die a sudden death
It's making me wonder
It's making me feel like I can dance on you
(I heard him say)
Tell me your problems, honor
(I'm trying, I'm trying hard)

How dare you cross my mind that way

Making me feel lots of things I can't explain
Making me feel lots of things I can't explain
Making me feel lots of things
I just want you to hold me forever

We're at an altar
(My feet are tired from running so fast)
I'm in your strong arms
The beauty of it all, super real
I stay on your good side
Maybe someday we'll have it all
(Defeat in my head, I heard him say)
Stuck on eternal honor
(I'm trying, I'm trying hard)

How dare you cross my mind that way

Making me feel lots of things I can't explain
Making me feel lots of things I can't explain (it's all in my head)
Making me feel lots of things
I just want you to hold me forever

I'll keep a copy of the pictures
Remembrance of my sisters
I can see the light now
I'm overgrown but not so broken
So now I'll say what I have spoken
I command the choir
It's unrequited, I don't fight it
No blood on my hands
No blood on my hands
No blood on my hands
That's how I like it
That's how I like it

"Ribbons"

It took all of California
To remind you why you came
Monterey to Camarillo
Camarillo to L.A.
Driving with the headlights off
Ribbons running down your face
'Cause you've never known love like that
So you dance the night away
And the night bleeds into Sunday morning
And it feels like it's going your way
Then all the lights in the bar turn on
And you remember why you came

And suddenly you're sober
And you stay up for the sunrise like a songbird
Moonwalking like a creep just
Just happy to, to be here at all
And suddenly you're older
Spinning the turnstile over and over
Who's gonna hold you while you sleep, well
It's brave to be nothing to no one at all

It's out of my hands
What can I tell you
I'm not losing it
I'm just having a laugh
Counting my paces
I'm making faces
At the one who stares at me
At the end of the glass

"Bruises Off The Peach"

Something's missing
And that's alright, I promise
I'm gonna give it until August
I'm not a Christian
I'm careless like a comet
You couldn't have me if you wanted

I cut all the bruises off the peach
Not as beautiful, but still as sweet
There you go again with all your needs
What did it ever have to do with me
What did it ever have to do with me

Staring at the ceiling now, a million hours pass
Love will always last
Love will always hold me down
What is it all about Oh
Staring at the ceiling now, a million hours pass
Love will always last
Love will always hold me down
What is it all about Oh

I cut all the bruises off the peach
Not as beautiful, but still as sweet
There you go again with all your needs
What did it ever have to do with me
What did it ever have to do with me
I cut all the bruises off the peach
Not as beautiful, but still as sweet
There you go again with all your needs
What did it ever have to do with me
What did it ever have to do with me

"Cinnamon Bread"

Infinite Jest and cinnamon bread
Why don't you make yourself at home
When you open up, you close me in
And cut me to the bone
Close as a kiss on the lip
To the southern tip
Until you're red in the face
Now you've got nothing to say
Now you've got nothing to say
Spring, summer, fall
You were standing tall
Winning all of your basketball games

You galloped on the piano keys
Like a Liberace fool
You hummed a little out of tune
And somehow you sounded cool
I can't lie
May, June, July
I was a good guy
Then you came over that day
Now I've got nothing to say
I must've left open the gate
Now the dog is running away

If this goes on forever
Could you ever keep me safe
Like all the men you've loved
The women you've loved
You tell me we're in this together
When I know it's not the case
'Cause all the men you've loved
The women you've loved
They all got something to say
They all got something to say
It couldn't keep me away

"Andromeda"

Sleeping to reality television
It was an Arizona pleasure with the wind
That night I had a dream you took me dancing
It was 92 degrees at 2 am

Twirling my hair
It's not everything I wished for
But I didn't care
I just liked having you there

What stops me from sending the call
In a midnight paranoia, hey
That's love after all, isn't it
What stops me from spending it all
Spinning out, Andromeda
Watching Jupiter come back around again

If the family is happy
Let 'em laugh, let 'em have their fun
My sister's raising a baby
In the house where my mother grew up
If I would've known you're out in the cold
Why did I go, why didn't I stay
Now, all that we've had is all that we have

There's a wound in the past
Pouring out the only bottle
Of milk for the cats
A dozen at that

What stops me from sending the call
In a midnight paranoia, hey
That's love after all, isn't it
What stops me from spending it all
Spinning out, Andromeda
Watching Jupiter come back around again

"Bright Red"

No cry, no pain
Close up, open
Rainbow overhead
Strawberry, bright red
Taste is the sweetest
Honey dripping
A circle won't end
Some lose, some win

All these satellites litter the sky
Not even we can see past these material things
Not even when it's free, yeah
There's a million ways that this could end
And no horizon's ever promised
So, while I hold my baby in my arms
I'll count on God to wake us up by sunrise

Good luck, good day
Glitter on my face
Screaming your name
Laughter everlasting
True love will last
Speed up, but don't crash

Driving up the 2 for better views and coastal weather
And I looked up at you, saw the flowers, I remember

All these satellites litter the sky
Not even we can see past these material things
Not even when it's free, yeah
There's a million ways that this could end
And no horizon's ever promised
So, while I hold my baby in my arms
I'll count on God to wake us up by sunrise

"Hunter"

Followed the trail
The hunter proposed me a left
Frost covered meadows
Coats in their cardinal red
I swallowed the beer
While a man who was holding a deer made his amends
And that's when I realized
All this time that I've been living in my head

All roads lead to where I started
Every sunrise follows darkness
Every single mountain has its peak (Ooh, ooh)

Horse in the stable
Of course it was raining out today
Thunder and lightning
Frightened the lone mare away
I've adapted to run
When it gets tough, I disappear
Warm blooded and wild
I can sense the changes in the air

Cedar trees fall in the forest
Echoing the cardinal chorus
Every moving river has its turn (Ooh, ooh)

Sandpaper pastures
Quilted in calico cream
You woke from a nightmare
Your nightmare woke me up from a dream
The stars are your burden
The lights and the curtains burned to the ground
But now and again I'll put on your movie
When no one is around

Didn't shoot, but yeah you thought it
Kissing clay from Caleb's cartridge
Every wildflower comes from dirt (Ooh, ooh)

Touting the keys
To a '73 Chevy truck
If I sold everything, bargain with a wink
It might be enough
The carnival phonies, the clowns and the ponies
Pour into town
I'm not seeking a shelter, but I'll be gone for a while
And I don't wanna be found

"White Teeth"

I'm not your brother
I can't take care of you
I've purchased furniture in place of you
I'd have you over
Jenni's in the other room
But she'll be leaving in the afternoon

Clear water, still water, we could both wade
Clear water, still water, what's our code name
Stay close or go far, I'll still wait

Old summer rain
Some lefts, some rights
So strange
In the porch light
Handprint on a windowpane
Like white teeth to a red wine stain
Some left, but the right ones stay
A good end to a Saturday

I walk to Bel Air
I walk until I'm new
I call up Jacob for something to do
You're somewhere out there
Leaving me little clues
Chewing licorice in your cowboy blues

Clear water, still water, we could both wade
Clear water, still water, what's our code name
Stay close or go far, I'll still wait

Old summer rain
Some lefts, some rights
So strange
In the porch light
Handprint on a windowpane
Like white teeth to a red wine stain
Some left, but the right ones stay
Went broke, but the band got paid

If I could stretch these hours into a lifetime
Well, I would stretch these arms
And do it at the right time, I would
In spirit you were there, well maybe next time
Careful with your words, won't let it slide by
Candy in your cheek, sweet goodbye

Old summer rain (Old summer rain)
Some lefts, some rights
So strange (Yeah)
In the porch light
Handprint on a windowpane
Like white teeth to a red wine stain
Some left, but the right ones stay
A good end to a Saturday

"Multiple Endings"

So you pull me apart
And now you're making me answer
But I don't answer to you
I went through days
With multiple endings
Just to get through
So now you're nervous
Come out with the crying
Boy, it's hard being you
We looked at the TV
For less than an hour
Boy, it's hard being used

You were right
Texas is hot at night
Thank God for the wind
There's a storm in sight
I didn't offer a room
I gave you a bed
Was all that a dream
Was it all in my head Mmm

And still even then, I always write you back
Yeah, I did you wrong, you did me ten times back
Blood washes away, even I know that
I stood from the canyon looking out to see
The marine layer over Santa Monica sea
Someday I'll disappear like the air underneath

You were right
Texas is hot at night
Thank God for the wind
There's a storm in sight
I didn't offer a room
I gave you a bed
Was all that a dream
Was it all in my head Oh

"Little Faith"

A brown paper bag
With 30-something tablets
To clean up my act
To keep it real candid
I sat down at the table
Took a pill from the palm of an angel
They say that it's good
It could save you

I don't think I want to do this
But I can't give into my old ways
So go on, honey
Hallelujah for a little faith

The laundry is turning
And every day I've been hurting
I'm always too late or too early
Never on time
The plant has been dying
I've watered it twice, I've been trying
Born green, lived yellow, then drying
I try once in awhile

I don't want to be a killer
But it died right there that day
So go on, sunny
Hallelujah for a little faith
What's it gonna take
What's it gonna take
Have a little faith
Have a little faith

Going through your jewelry
I smile, but I know you see through me
You knew who I was 'fore I knew me
On the very first day
Now I know what you're onto
You were just looking for someone to talk to
A beautiful life to belong to
Now you're getting your way

I didn't think I'd want to be here
But something told me I should stay
So go on, mother
Hallelujah for a little faith
What's it gonna take
What's it gonna take
Have a little faith
Have a little faith

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

"By My Side"

Honestly, I don't know where I'll be
In a couple years, hope I fulfil my fantasy
There'll be no tears, someday it'll work out
Work out for me
I know it's gettin' closer
Close to see

If I start to be myself
Every single day of my life
Something tells me that I'm gonna be alright
If I ever lose myself
All my friends will be by my side
Nothing's ever gonna change the way I feel

If you got a minute, if you got a minute
Promise that I won't change
If you ever want it, if you ever want it
Call out my name

When I was younger
I would call on my brother
Now he calls on me for a little bit of sunshine
Some peace of mind
My only advice
Never think twice
Follow you heart
If you get lost, go back to the start
Woo-woo-woo, ooh, ooh

If I start to be myself
Every single day of my life
Something tells me that I'm gonna be alright
If I ever lose myself
All my friends will be by my side
Nothing's ever gonna change the way I feel

If you got a minute, if you got a minute
Promise that I won't change
If you ever want it, if you ever want it
Call out my name

When I was younger
I would call on my brother
Now he calls on me for a little bit of sunshine
Some peace of mind
My only advice
Never think twice
Follow you heart
If you get lost, go back to the start
Woo-woo-woo, ooh, ooh

If I start to be myself
Every single day of my life
Something tells me that I'm gonna be alright
If I ever lose myself
All my friends will be by my side
Nothing's ever gonna change the way I feel

If you got a minute, if you got a minute
Promise that I won't change
If you ever want it, if you ever want it
Call out my name

"Dark Circles, A Performance"

Match me, when I tell you things that no one knows about me
What keeps me up at night
What keeps you in my life

I left you at time when you were trying to get your life back
I'll probably end up somewhere in the lime light
What keeps me up at night
What keeps you in my life

I swear, If I could give you up
I would erase you
Get you out of my mind (he's all I think about)
Let you go somewhere else (try to let go but I can't help)

Alone in the clothes you let me borrow
When the rain came
I'm laying down and I can't help but daydream
Who do you idolize now
Do you ever think about me

Think about me
Think about me
Think about me

I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me

I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me

I think forever is too long
What does it mean to be loyal
I put your jacket on
To make me feel important

I think forever is too long
What does it mean to be loyal
I put your jacket on
To make me feel important

Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover

I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me

I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me

"Memories & Photographs"

Took my heart, left your sweater 
I thought time would make it better 
I'm still talking to the pain 
I thought that I could be forgiving 
With all the letters I have written 
But the past is hard to change 

You left me at the table  
Thinking 'bout the past 
Now all I have are memories and photographs 

I miss our careful conversations 
The simple expectations 
It was never hard for us 
But lately all I can remember 
Is that phone call in December 
Saying that I'm not enough 

Now I'm sitting here at the table 
Thinking 'bout the past 
Now all I have are memories and photographs 
Memories and photographs 

Where oh where oh did you run and hide 
Why oh why oh did you say goodbye 
Is it really goodbye 
Is it really goodbye 

Now I'm sitting here at the table 
Thinking about the past 
Now all I have are memories and photographs 
Memories and photographs 
Memories and photographs

"Nobody Like You"

I knew right from the start that you would have my heart 
So now it's here in your hands 
You got me in a daze so caught up in your ways 
I can't believe what I am

And sometimes you drive me crazy know that it don't faze me 
Cause baby I ain't going nowhere

I just wanna love you place no one above you 
Ain't nobody do it like you
I just can't control it girl just let me show it 
Ain't nobody do it like you

There's something bout your style the way you walk, the way you smile 
Keeps me coming right back to you (yeah)
No make-up I don't care don't have to do your hair 
You're still the best in the room

So forget them other girls there ain't nothing in this world
That keeps me coming right back to you

I'm just gonna love you place no one above you 
Ain't nobody do it like you
I just can't control it girl just let me show it
Ain't nobody do it like you

Da da da da daa da da da da daa I - (yeah) Uumm yeah

I just wanna love you place no one above you
Ain't nobody do it like you 
I just can't control it girl just let me show it 
Ain't nobody do it like you

I just wanna love you place no one above you
Ain't nobody do it like you yeah

"Passion"

Broken politicks, wonder if
You can change my mind
And move to the flicker of the life
Say goodbye, to the high

I'm shutting out all the messages
Breaking down again
Breaking from your grip
Do you miss me
Yeah, Imma make you sense
I don't know

At least I tried
At least I tried
I'm getting tired
Of running
And wearing this broken crown

I'll fight for it
I swear I'll never lose the passion
When I'm down
Can I call out your name
I swear I'll never lose the passion
When I'm down
Can I call out your name

I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry
Just wanna take what's mine
And do it all in time

Remember who we are
Remember who we are
When we are apart
This love is dark

I'll fight for it
I swear I'll never lose the passion
When I'm down
Can I call out your name
I swear I'll never lose the passion
When I'm down
Can I call out your name

I don't wanna cry
Myself to sleep
I stay awake
So I can dream
Of you and I
And everything
Come back to me
Come back to me

I'll fight for it
I swear I'll never lose to passion
When I'm down
Can I call out your name
I swear I'll never lose the passion
When I'm down
Can I call out your name

When I'm down
Can I call out your name

"Dog Days"

I think of you while you're at work
Out in the fields, tearing up the earth
But I like you best when you're at home
Giving it to me so nice and fucking slow

No one's ever gonna love me, no not like you do
Every night I'm crying in my sleep 'cause I'm dreaming about you
And I've tried so hard to quit you like I promised my mama I would
But it's no good, it's no good

You walk a fine line between god and animal
You're just a feral dog I worship in bedroom ceremonials
Cut me up and take me like the bread and blood at church
Love's never been more than pain, so baby, show me how bad you hurt

No one's ever gonna love me, no not like you do
Every night I'm crying in my sleep 'cause I'm still dreaming about you
And I've tried so hard to quit you like I promised my mama I would
But it's no good, it's no good
It's no good, it's no good
We're no good
You're no good
I'm no good
We're no good

"Misuse Oh"

I told you from the start
I disappear when it gets cold
But you found a way to keep me here
With a body to hold

And I think of you
When I'm drunk in the road in front of your old house
I miss what you'd do to me
When I was in need of you and blacked out

I miss you, darling
I miss you so
I'm sorry I went crazy
I just thought I'd let you know

Taking pictures while you sleep
Leftovers on the table, strangers on the TV
I'm bleeding from my ears
Sneaking out while you're asleep 'cause you're my biggest fear

And I think of you
When I'm drunk in the road in front of your old house
I miss what you'd do to me
When I was in need of you and blacked out

I miss you, darling
I miss you so
I miss you, darling

"Antlers"

Daddy, there's pain in your smile
I've never seen you so dark
You'll never walk me down the aisle
You won't make it that far
Mama took the keys and she ran
The baby's blood is on your hands
We both know it's what you deserve

I tried to pull you out
But you built this bed to rot
Look at this hell you've caused
And you'll blame yourself cause

It's all your fault
It's all your fault
It's all your fault
It's all your fault

"Sunday Morning"

Swaying softly, streetlights glowing through my windows
Trying on each dress I bought for you
Do I look pretty
When I ask you to hit me

Hands like barbed wire
Wrapped around my throat, making me cry like I told you I wanted in the car, on the long drive home
Baby, we're alone now

Sunday morning, everything hurts except for you
Except for you
Except for you
Except for you

And I like thinking I'm no different from you
Different from you
Different from you
When I go home at night I think about the ways that I can get out
Of the hold you've got me in
Of the hold you've got me in

You've still got time, waiting on the other side
You'll still be alright, if you just make it to the other side
You'll still be alright, even after all this time
You'll still be alright, you'll still be alright

Sunday morning, nothing hurts, not even you
No, not even you
No, not even you

"Casings"

Am I not good enough for you
Is there something wrong with me
You say, "Don't cry, you know you're mine"
Baby, don't you lie to me

Am I just not what you want
Am I just not what you need
Is there someone who has your heart
That keeps you gone away from me

Is she prettier than me
Is her skin softer than mine
Can she give you what I can't
The things I cry for every night

Is it something in how she moves
When you're undressed inside her house
Does she smile the way I do
When she has you in her mouth

Do you not love me like you did
When you told me that it's fine
That I've been hurt, cause you've been too
And that kind of pain, you don't mind

I think about you every day
'Cause I love you more than I thought I could
And now that you're gone, I wanna die
'Cause I don't hate you like I know I should

Was I not good enough for you
Was there something wrong with me
I just cry by myself at night
But you'll never know and you'll never see

"Lilies"
(feat. Mercy Necromancy)

Tell me I'm no one else's but yours
Watching me undress standing in the door
Wedding doves and leather gloves and all the things you're made up of
What a wondrous thing to be in love

You're like an angel
Nothing can touch you
But I want to hold you
I want to love you
You're like an angel
I can't come close to you
You know my weakness
But you don't know what I'd do

You're such an angel
And I'm gonna hurt you
I know I'm gonna lose you
But God, don't want to

Lilies grow all over the room
And when you come inside, they bloom
There is nothing that I want but you
Tell me can I be seen through

You're like an angel
Nothing can touch you
But I want to hold you
I want to love you
You're like an angel
I can't come close to you
You know my weakness
But you don't know what I'd do

You're such an angel
And I'm gonna hurt you
I know I'm gonna lose you
But God, I don't want to

"Head In The Wall"

Sometimes you make me wanna put my fucking head through the wall
Sometimes I wonder if I even know you at all
Fall asleep to the sound of your old rotating fan
I cut the fuck out of myself, and soaked the bed sheets with blood again

I hold my head underwater just to drown out the noise
It's always my fault, girls will be bitches, and boys will be boys
I know I don't need you but I'm terrified of letting you go
Even after all the times you fucked the shit out of me while I was crying "No"

And how am I supposed to feel good about myself when everything I do is wrong
When I'm just an ugly bitch, a fucking freak, and I don't wanna go on
And I don't wanna leave my house cause I know everybody's staring at me now
"Why the hell am I alive" is what they think, they wanna take me down

And I can't get out, can't run away, there's no escaping you now
(There's no escaping you now)
I'm gonna die all alone, next to you, in this piece of shit town
And we've been cursed since the start, Jesus didn't want us, no
And you take all of your sins out on my body, like everyone else does
Shooting up our old school when we get bored of shooting up
And fuck the cops, and fuck God, and fuck this town for ruining us
And they'll put holes in all we own and in our heads, pumped full of lead
You always told me I could only leave you once we're both dead

Sometimes you make wanna put my fucking head through the wall
Sometimes I wonder if I ever even knew you at all

"Knuckle Velvet"
(feat. Yah Wav)

Nothing hurts like you do, like the way you say I love you
Leave the room half undressed, I'm saying prayers through a throttled neck
Come into the room and make me cry all over again

You come in so hard, gore me through the heart
Just another day and you'll still tell me you're healing
See it on your face, you won't ever change in your ways
Shed your knuckle velvet, torn on my teeth
When you're torn apart, you'll destroy me again

Bleeding out on your sleeve, you kill me any way but softly
With all your crying like you did that first night I made you spend on your own
You're such a child and you know it

Nothing in my heart is hoping you'll come back
Too cold to know what I don't have without you, no
Without you
Every drop of blood is love I don't get back
Bated to take the love that I gave away to save you

"Selby Wall"

There comes a point in every girl's life where she just wants to go fucking feral
Take a man between her hands and rip that motherfucker's limbs from him
And every time I let you fuck me, I think about how easy it would be to take your life away from you
Which I'd never do, unless you force me to

You never tell me that I'm pretty, you just say you like my tits
And every time I cry you say "don't be a little bitch"
But I'm still stupid and in love and I'd still let you fuck me 'til I'm cumming blood

But baby, one of these days I'm gonna crack
And cut you up with a rusty saw in my daddy's shed and bury the pieces out back
Lie on your grave and masturbate and think of all the things we could have been
Cause baby, if you fuck me over I'll make sure that you can't do it again

There comes a point in every man's life where he gets the need to destroy
Some sickness in his guts that started growing when he was just a little boy
And all the times you bruised my throat and pulled my hair until it broke and held me down and fucked me 'til I was on the brink of death
Cause when you fuck, you fuck until there's nothing left

You never tell me that I'm pretty, you just say you love my ass
And you go on and on about some girl that you fucked in the past
You're such a man, I bet that I could fuck her better than you can

But baby, one of these days I'm gonna crack
Cut you up with a rusty saw in my daddy's shed and bury the pieces out back
Lie on your grave and masturbate and think of all the things we could have been
Cause baby, if you fuck me over I'll make sure that you can't do it again

And I saw her downtown and asked her out, went to her house and we fucked in her bed
She's sweeter than you'll ever be when I give her kisses between her legs
You don't deserve such pretty things when you all you do is shoot to kill
She'll love me and I'll love her better than you could, I promise you I will

And baby, I told you one of these days I swore I was gonna crack
That I'd take you from your crying mother and I'd never give you back
She and I lie on your grave and masturbate and think of all the things we'll do
Now that we've moved on, now that you're gone, now that we know we're better off without you

"Child Of Cain"

Paint my Sistine Chapel white
On my couch all night
Show me love
In whatever way it comes to you
As long as you hold me tight

I know your father hurt you
You say that's why God gave you me
You say I make it a little better
You say I make you happy
You say it with your fingers clenched
Wrapped tight around my neck
'Cause that's what love means to you
And I asked for it I guess

Oh oh
Beautiful, sweet, child of Cain
All you know is how to feel and how to deal
Out pain

I take my mother's scissors
Carve your name into my chest
'Cause I think you're so amazing
'Cause I think that you're the best
And the way you hurt me softly
Brings back such sweet memories
Of how the angels in my room and I
Would play when I was three
And if I try hard as I can
I think that I can make believe
That what we have is really love
'Cause what else could it even be

It'd be impossible to live
Without you here with me
And it doesn't even matter
That with or without you I can't breathe

Oh oh
Beautiful, sweet, child of Cain
All you know is how to feel and how to deal
Out pain

"Michelle Pfeiffer"
(feat. lil aaron)

[Ethel Cain]
Everything's easier way out west
Wholly mad and half undressed
I love the way it always feels to miss you
I tell all my friends everything you do
A sick obsession that I still try to prove
But it's no good, 'cause who am I without you

And home's not home unless you're there
And I'll never be ready but I don't care
Wide awake all night thinking about you
Do you think of me too
I hate to let you go, but if I don't
Then we both know
I'll bury us both, fed to the night
As ghosts

[lil aaron]
I keep on losing track of time
Cause what's the point if you're not by my side
I told my mom about you, she just laughed
Driving with my eyes closed, hope I crash
Maybe we could be together in another life
Maybe this could be forever in another timeline
But right now, I gotta pack my bags
And I won't even miss you tomorrow

[Ethel Cain]
'Cause home's not home unless you're there
And I'll never be ready but I don't care
Wide awake all night thinking about you
Do you think of me too
I hate to let you go, but if I don't
Then we both know
I'll bury us both, fed to the night
As ghosts

Washed out days and stone-cold nights
Best goddamn days of your whole life
Jack the car and let it ride
Kicking it, baby, we'll survive
I'm all run and you're all fight
Tangling with Jesus Christ
Total ruin idolized
But the kids will be alright

'Cause home's not home unless you're there
And I'll never be ready but I don't care
Wide awake all night thinking about you
Do you think of me too
I hate to let you go, but if I don't
Then we both know
I'll bury us both, fed to the night
As ghosts

"Crush"

His window's already passed
So he's shooting at the glass
Keeping guns in his locker
And he denies it
Like it's actually important
But he lied 'cause I sure did watch him
Showing up wearing black
And he knows that

His daddy's on death row
But he'll say it with his chest, though
His friends move dope
He hasn't tried coke
But he's always had a problem saying no
His older brother bagged the valedictorian
His mother steady screaming he should be more like him

Can you read my mind I've been watching you
(You know it, you know it, you know it, you know it's true)
Couldn't fight to save your life but you look so cool
Camo jacket robbing corner stores
Hard odds to beat when you're on all fours
Good men die too so I'd rather be with you

I owe you a black eye and two kisses
Tell me when you wanna come and get em
I only want him if he says it first to me
I wanna (oh) him in the back of his mom's Mercury
He looks like he works with his hands
And smells like Marlboro reds
It makes me so (oh) and I can't get enough of it

Something's been feeling weird lately
There's just something about you, baby
Maybe I'll just be crazy
And piss him off 'til he hates me
(Yeah right, he fucking loves me)
Low slung bad bitch, baby come and get you some

Can you read my mind I've been watching you
Couldn't fight to save your life but you look so cool
(You know it, you know it, you know)
Camo jacket robbing corner stores
Hard odds to beat when you're on all fours
Good men die too so I'd rather be with you

Oh, I'd rather be with you
Oh, I'd rather be with you
'Cause good men die too so I'd rather be with you

"God's Country"
(feat. Wicca Phase Springs Eternal)

The road is longer than it is hard
With no one to guide you
And no one to hold
No best foot forward to sway the odds
And just a voice inside you
And a stone to throw

Could you be someone else
If someone else is what I need
But I shouldn't ask that of you
When you're old you'll understand
But we're hurting now so what are we to do 'til then
Cradling pictures of you

It was a highway to nowhere, and we rode it
Cold car with no gas and we chose it
Soft bodies playing in the street
Our kids will grow up with half as much
Trying to build something out of dust
Finding out too late what they need

You've tasted love and it tasted sweet
You drank the blood and bit the meat
You hold it, you hold it, you let it go
You close your eyes and count to three
You say the word and come to me
Baby, I know

Drive the pathway through the pines
And the moors of mystery
Welcome conflict and let crisis come
And shake the ground beneath
And the family secret hiding
In the farmhouse down the street
Rushes open door on your front porch
And shadows me
Taken and entirely I embraced the bonny beast
Over hills and highlands, we rode hard the passing peaks
Danger like the virgin wife, beside me she would sleep
Cherry was her dad's truck that she crashed at seventeen
I kneel before what temper broke the branches on the beach
And those thrilling highs and southern nights are always out of reach

I learned a lesson
I need to pray hard, final hours
Take care of me god
Take care of me god

You've tasted love and it tasted sweet
You drank the blood and bit the meat
You hold it, you hold it, you let it go
You close your eyes and count to three
You say the word and come to me
Baby, I know

The road is longer than it is hard
(Love overwhelms me)
With no one to guide you
(It's all that I want, and it's all that we have)
No best foot forward to sway the odds
(But is it enough)
Just a voice inside you
(To make it worth it in the end)
Don't sink in me with your dog teeth
Don't sink in me with your dog teeth
Don't sink in me with your dog teeth
Don't sink in me
Don't sink in me with your dog teeth

You've tasted love and it tasted sweet
You drank the blood and bit the meat
You hold it, you hold it, but you'll never know
You close your eyes and cry to me
Don't sink in me with your dog teeth
We're better off if you let go
In God's country
In God's country

If it was harder then
It will be better now
For I am here and changed
I couldn't tell you how
There before the grace of God go I
Laughing to myself
Forgetting what about
No best foot forward to sway the odds
And just a voice inside you
And a stone to throw

"Unpunishable"

Down bad and nasty
Sacrificial angel, dirty slut with needs
In a convocation or a room alone
Call me what you want and I'll be that
Sucking on his teeth, he needs it so bad
He's screaming "Party's over, go the fuck home"

The darker the fruit, the sweeter
I ask him if he's ok with that
He's mean, I'm meaner
My baby says that he's not afraid of that
I say "You're right, in a way"
Giving it up on top of him
He says "How so, babe"
He wants to know how

Babe
I'm too good for you
And it makes me need it even more
Whose is it now
It's yours
Red and blue
Used and abused
It's still never enough
I'm unpunishable

Swollen up with envy
Says I'm his favorite
Yeah I fucking better be
Drifting just right out of sight
Show me where it hurts and I'll
Lick it better
In the red light

Numb faces in a dark bar
We don't even know where we are
I don't even know who you are

I don't even know who you are babe
I'm too good for you
And it makes me need it even more
Whose is it now
It's yours
Red and blue
Used and abused
It's still never enough
I'm unpunishable

"Inbred"

Bare naked under my nightgown
Pissing on the stove to put it out
Watching him through holes in his door
Sucking on the back of his leg to stay warm

Older brother made a name for himself with the cops
Scumbag fuck but I swear that he's not
He's so good to me and to nobody else
So you should watch yourself
Mama's comatose, she can't leave the bed
Something smells rotten and it's starting to spread
I'm bad, he's worse, we're already dead
We're already dead

We wake up and all the fucking lights are out

You can't win 'em all
Who knows how much longer
I'll lay on the floor
Touch me 'til I vomit
I'm not scared of god
I'm scared he was gone all along
Who will take the fall
Who of us is stronger
You'll just want it more
If you could, you'd have fought it
But you know you're not
From the start, they knew you were wrong
You were wrong

Older brother made a name for himself with the feds
White trash dick but I love him to death
He's so good to me and to nobody else
So you can fuck yourself
You get off on innocence so you savor this
Does your baby know her daddy's a rapist
He hates the way you look at me
You're already dead
You're already dead

If he wakes up, he'll show you what I'm talking about

You can't win 'em all
Who knows how much longer
I'll lay on the floor
Touch me 'til I vomit
(Touch me 'til) I'm not scared of god
I'm scared he was gone all along
Who will take the fall
Who of us is stronger
You'll just want it more
If you could, you'd have fought it
But you know you're not
From the start, they knew you were wrong
You were wrong
You were wrong
You were wrong

"Two-Headed Mother"

You know
You know
You know
You know

You think that you create the waves
But I create you
Two-headed mother in your bed
You know she hates you
Kissing tyrannical heads spitting at you
Babe, fire you wade through
The ways I fuck myself and get down good
Never need to mind you
I've loved before, I'll kill again
You're just the worst of all my men
I'm not gon' pull you out the den so they don't bite you
I won't feel good again until I'm up inside you

I love you
I love you
I love you
I'll love 'til I'm sore
I don't love you
I don't love you
I don't love you
I don't love you no more

Two-headed mother pulled you from the black
And she can send you back

"Crying During Sex"

I sing the lord's euthanasia blues
When I take you and your brother in the back pew
Drive into the median, keep myself from eating and wonder why I feel so sick
Tradition's ligature marks always yellow through

I lied when I said I didn't want you
In no time, you'll forget the way we were supposed to be
Asking what I'm on this time, holding on to you like I do
Like we're the only people in the world god left to mind to

Two drowning coals won't ever light
But if I ask you to, you'll warm the night

If I want you like I said I'd never do
I would hold my breath and sit down next to you
Terrified you'll bite the hand that needs you
And right now I need you
I don't know what happened
I don't know what happened
I was young and sweet
And then something happened
Something overwhelming
Something everlasting

Time drags on
I hate him for the time he's gone
I've been here for weeks, I've been here for years
I've been here too long
I forgot what stop means
Either I drink it or the boat sinks
It's easy for him to get out of me
What I've been praying will get out of me

Will I always be crying during sex with you
All my dreams take place in heaven where it's quiet, lying next to you
Heavy breathing and sighs, bruises between my thighs, look me deep in my eyes like I'm a river worth wading
And if I'm crying, it's because I'm in love

And I could love you if I tried
And I'm trying
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying

"Earnhardt"

First you've got to do it for Dale...
Raise hell, praise Dale...

Love is a nightmare and all that you've got
Still getting lost in a bare parking lot
And the vertigo's fun til' you want it to stop
Praying this is the end when you know it's not

I could be good but it wouldn't matter
There's no silver line on a fucking disaster
I hope that you're happy, glad you can forget
While I'm spending my nights reliving it

Been scared of the dark for all of my life
I'm digging my grave by all of the lights
I'm always afraid but never to die
But not just yet so I'll be

Twirling around my room again
Spraying blood like the food court fountain
Forgive me, my trespasses
Holding me down through a hole in the mattress
You think you're someone else
That it only hurts when it hurts yourself
Americanized, Jesus Christ
Born to lie, so you lie and you lie and you lie and

You need easy, you want weak
When you were hungry, I was soft and pink
I bleed easy, I go weak
You look hungry then back to me
If I fall, I fall hard
Onto you and then all apart
But when the room went dark
And I needed you...
Where were you

Twirling around my room again
Spraying blood like the food court fountain
Forgive me, my trespasses
Holding me down through a hole in the mattress
You think you're someone else
That it only hurts when it hurts yourself
Americanized, Jesus Christ
Born to lie, so you lie and you lie and you lie and

"Age Of Delilah"

There comes a day you sneak out but you don't go home
Where you're out past the streetlights, running down the road and your daddy won't know
It hurts to grow up, when your knees are still cut
But for us, life's never been without blood

Getting life's cold goodbye wave from the dark of the driveway
Crying, I'm no good at goodbyes, so I leave it to the lights
Can you just tell me which way I'm driving
Interstate or the highway, I'm going, I'm ready

There comes a day you find out that you don't wanna die
They'll say it's time you finally grew up, you've been gone for quite a while, but they'll never ask you why
They ask how it felt to suffocate myself
But not everything feels like something else

Getting life's cold goodbye wave from the dark of the driveway
Crying, I'm no good at goodbyes, so I leave it to the lights
Can you just tell me which way I'm driving
Interstate or the highway, I'm going, I'm ready

20 'til midnight at gas stations
Praying to a stranger's dogs in the parking lot
I asked have I done enough for salvation
They said you'll die if you leave it up to God
Said I've been drinking from this river 'til I bled it dry
But they looked me dead in my eyes and said
It doesn't matter if the grass is greener on the other side
As long as it's alive

So give it one last goodbye wave, in the light of the highway
Crying, I'm no good at goodbyes, but I've waited my whole life
So you just tell me which way I'm driving
Interstate or the highway, we're going, we're ready

"Michelle Pfeiffer (Solo Version)"

Everything's easier way out west
Wholly mad and half undressed
I love the way it always feels to miss you
I tell all my friends everything you do
A sick obsession that I still try to prove
But it's no good, 'cause who am I without you

And home's not home unless you're there
And I'll never be ready but I don't care
Wide awake all night thinking about you
Do you think of me too
I hate to let you go, but if I don't
Then we both know
I'll bury us both, fed to the night
As ghosts

I see you, I feel you, I know you
And I would never tell you the truth
That tunnelled light will always die with your youth
You don't know the things I've seen
So let go of the woe and hand it back over to me
You missed the heart and you just hit all the meat
And the bite back's twice as mean

'Cause home's not home unless you're there
And I'll never be ready but I don't care
Wide awake all night thinking about you
Do you think of me too
I hate to let you go, but if I don't
Then we both know
I'll bury us both, fed to the night
As ghosts

Washed out days and stone-cold nights
Best goddamn days of your whole life
Jack the car and let it ride
Kicking it, baby, we'll survive
I'm all run and you're all fight
Tangling with Jesus Christ
Total ruin idolized
But the kids will be alright

'Cause home's not home unless you're there
And I'll never be ready but I don't care
Wide awake all night thinking about you
Do you think of me too
I hate to let you go, but if I don't
Then we both know
I'll bury us both, fed to the night
As ghosts

"Family Tree (Intro)"

These crosses all over my body
Remind me of who I used to be
And Christ forgive these bones I'm hiding
From no one successfully

Jesus can always reject his father
But he cannot escape his mother's blood
He'll scream and try to wash it off of his fingers
But he'll never escape what he's made up of

The fate's already fucked me sideways
Swinging by my neck from the family tree
He'll laugh and say, "You know I raised you better than this"
Then leave me hanging so they all can laugh at me

"American Teenager"

Grew up under yellow light on the street
Putting too much faith in the make-believe
And another high school football team
The neighbor's brother came home in a box
But he wanted to go, so maybe it was his fault
Another red heart taken by the American dream

And I feel it there
In the middle of the night
When the lights go out and I'm all alone again

Say what you want, but say it like you mean it
With your fists for once, a long cold war
With your kids at the front
Just give it one more day, then you're done
Done
I do what I want, crying in the bleachers
And I said it was fun
I don't need anything from anyone, it's just not my year
But I'm all good out here

Sunday morning
Hands over my knees in a room full of faces
I'm sorry if I sound off, but I was probably wasted
And didn't feel so good
Head full of whiskey but I always deliver
Jesus, if you're listening let me handle my liquor
And Jesus, if you're there, why do I feel alone in this room with you

And I feel it there
In the middle of the night
When the lights go out
But I'm still standing here

Say what you want, but say it like you mean it
With your fists for once, a long cold war
With your kids at the front
Just give it one more day, then you're done
Done
I do what I want, crying in the bleachers
And I said it was fun
I don't need anything from anyone
It's just not my year
But I'm all good out here

Say what you want, but say it like you mean it
With your fist for once
A long cold war
With your kids at the front
Just give it one more day, then you're done
I do it for my daddy and I do it for Dale
I'm doing what I want and damn, I'm doing it well
For me, for me
For me, for me

"A House In Nebraska"

Labored breaths and bed sores
Sing it to me all day long
When the aching sound of silence
Used to be our favorite song
You and me against the world
You were my man and I your girl
We had nothing except each other
You were my whole world
But then the day came
And you were up and gone

And I still call home that house in Nebraska
Where we found each other on a dirty mattress on the second floor
Where the world was empty
Save you and I
Where you came and I laughed, and you left, and I cried
Where you told me even if we died tonight, that I'd die yours

These dirt roads are empty
The ones we paved ourselves
Your mama calls me sometimes
To see if I'm doing well
And I lie to her
And say that I'm doing fine
When really I'd kill myself
To hold you one more time
And it hurts to miss you
But it's worse to know
That I'm the reason
You won't come home

But I still call home that house in Nebraska
Where we found each other on a dirty mattress on the second floor
(When I needed you, and I need you still)
Where the world was empty
Save you and I
Where you came and I laughed, and you left, and I cried
Where you told me even if we died tonight, that I'd die yours
(So I died there under you, every night, all night)

You know, I still wait at the edge of town
Praying straight to God that maybe you'll come back around
I cry every day, and the bottles make it worse
'Cause you were the only one I was never scared to tell I hurt
And I found photographs of our school, on the day we met
I thought that you were so beautiful, it was love, I guess
And you might never come back home, and I may never sleep at night
But God, I just hope you're doing fine out there, I just pray that you're all right

And I feel so alone
And I feel so alone out here
I feel so alone
And I feel so alone out here
And I feel so alone without you
I'm so alone out here
I feel so alone, I feel so alone
I'm so alone out here without you, baby

(I'm alone)

"Western Nights"

He's never looked more beautiful
On his Harley in the parking lot
Breaking in to the ATMs
Sleeping naked when it gets too hot
I watched him show his love through shades of black and blue
Starting fights at the bar across the street like you do
The neighbors beat on the wall while I'm face-first in the bed
Show me how much I mean to you, while I'm lying in these sheets undressed

I'd hold the gun if you asked me to
But if you love me like you say you do
Would you ask me to

Trouble's always gonna find you baby
But so will I
Crying only because I'm happy
Hold me across every state line
I'm never gonna leave you baby
Even if you lose what's left of your mind
'Cause you know I'll be right there beside you
Riding through all these western nights

I haven't spoken to my daddy in a long, long time
I don't want him to worry, always wondering if I'm alright
But the neighborhood keeps getting smaller
All starved out when the money's paper thin
All that's left are your walls and you'll die there
I should have known that there's no getting in

Trouble's always gonna find you baby
But so will I
Crying only because I'm happy
Hold me across every state line
I'm never gonna leave you baby
Even if you lose what's left of your mind
'Cause you know I'll still be right behind you
Riding through all these western nights

Through these western nights
Crying in the light of the TV static
I'll still be alright
Clinging onto you like some love blind addict
I'll be screaming your name
Past the gas stations, trailing down the interstate
Please don't love how I need you
And know that one day, you and I could be ok

"Family Tree"

These crosses all over my body
Remind me of who I used to be
Give myself up to him in offering
Let him make a woman out of me
I'm just a child but I'm not above violence
My mama raised me better than that
When the preacher talks, that man demands his silence
Daddy said shoot first then run and don't look back

So take me down to the river and bathe me clean
Put me on the back of your white horse to ride
All the way to the chapel, let you wash all over me

I've killed before and I'll kill again
Take the noose off, wrap it tight around my hand
They say heaven hath no fury like a woman scorned
And baby, Hell don't scare me, I've been times before

So take me down to the river and bathe me clean
Put me on the back of your white horse to ride
All the way to the chapel, let you wash all over me

These crosses all over my body
Remind me of who I used to be
Let Christ forgive these bones I've been hiding
And the bones I'm about to leave

So take me down to the river and bathe me clean
Put me on the back of your white horse to ride
All the way to the chapel, let you wash all over me

"Hard Times"

Hide me there
Under the leaves
9 going on 18
Lay it on me
Tell me a story
About how it ends
Where you're still the good guy
I'll make pretend
Cause I hate this story
Where happiness ends
And dies with you

I thought good guys get to be happy
I'm not happy
I am poison in the water and unhappy
Little girl who needs her daddy real bad

In the corner
On my birthday
You watched me
Dancing right there in the grass
I was too young
To notice
That some types of love could be bad
Praying I'd be like you
Doing all of the things that you do
And I still do
And that scares me

I'm tired of you, still tied to me
(Bleeding whenever you want)
Too tired to move, too tired to leave
I'm tired of you, still tied to me
(It's just the way that you are)
I'm tired of you, too tired to leave
(I just wanna sleep)
I'm tired of you, still tied to me
(I just wanna sleep)
Too tired to move, too tired to leave
(I just wanna sleep)
I'm tired of you, still tied to me
(Please, can I sleep, can I sleep)
I'm tired of you, too tired to leave
I'm tired of you, still tied to me
Too tired to move, too tired to leave

"Thoroughfare"

You fell in love with America when you were 12 years old
And by 17 you knew you had to see it all
You loved your dad and the love he had for your mother so
You had to get out and go chasin' it's sweet call

I met you there in Texas somewhere on the thoroughfare
On the side of the road in some torn up clothes with a pistol in my pocket
I didn't trust no one but you said "Baby, don't run, I'll take you anywhere"
So I hopped right in, outta luck to spend, and at least your truck beats walking

And you said "Hey, do you wanna see the west with me
Cause love's out there and I can't leave it be"
And I said "Honey, love's never meant much to me
But I'll come with you if you're sure it's what you need"

So we made off for California to find your lover, driving day and night
And every small town diner saw our faces at least once or twice
But in these motel rooms, I started to see you differently
Cause for the first time since I was a child, I could see a man who wasn't angry

And he said "It's been a long damn time since I left Florida, no one left to leave, no one left to love
But now that I met you, I finally know just where I'm headin'"
And we found heaven in time where your western sunshine met my deep southern wet
And you got lost in it and yet you found yourself hard pressed for air and sweatin'

And you said "Hey, do you wanna see the west with me
(Do you wanna see the west with me)
Cause love's out there and I can't leave it be"
(I can't leave it, I can't leave it)
And I said "Honey, love's never meant that much to me
(Nothing much)
But I'll come with you if you're sure it's what you need"

Once we reached the coast you said "End of the line, we finally hit the edge, after all this time
I didn't find my love but I still made it this far without it"
But then you turned to me and stared into me deep and said "But maybe not, cause look at what I've got
You might not be my love, but, baby, I doubt it"

And you said "Hey, do you wanna see the west with me
Cause love's out there and I can't leave it be"
And I said "Honey, love's never meant much to me
But I'll come with you if you're sure it's what you need"

Cause in your pickup truck with all of your dumb luck is the only place I think I'd ever wanna be

"Gibson Girl"

You wanna love me right now
You wanna get alone with me
You wanna get my clothes off
And hurt me
You came alone to me
From however far away
Asking me to know how I know
You're all the same

Black leather and dark glasses
Pouring another while I shake my ass
He's cold-blooded so it takes more time to bleed
Obsession with the money, addicted to the drugs
Says he's in love with my body, that's why he's fucking it up
And then he says to me

"Baby, if it feels good
Then it can't be bad"
Where I can be immoral
In a stranger's lap
And if you want it good
Downright iconic
Something they all want
That only you can have

You wanna fuck me right now
You wanna see me on my knees
You wanna rip these clothes off
And hurt me

And if you hate me
Please don't tell me
Just let the lights bleed
All over me

If it feels good
Then it can't be bad
Where I can be immoral
In a stranger's lap
And if you want it good
Downright iconic
Then I would show you something
You can never have

And if it feels good
Then it can't be bad
Where I can be immoral
In a stranger's lap
And if you want it good
Downright iconic
Then I would show you something
You can never have

You wanna love me right now
You wanna love me right now
You wanna fuck me right now
You wanna
You wanna love me right now
You wanna love me right now
You wanna fuck me, fuck me
You wanna love me, love me
You wanna

"Ptolemaea"

I followed you in
I was with you there
I invited you in
Twice, I did
You love blood too much
But not like I do
Not like I do

Heard you, saw you, felt you, gave you
Need you, love you, love you, love you
Heard you, saw you, felt you, gave you
Need you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, saw you, love you, gave you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, saw you, felt you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you

Suffer does the wolf, crawling to thee
Promising a big fire, any fire
Saying I'm the one, he's gonna take me
I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on fire
Suffering is nigh, drawing to me
Calling me the one, I'm the white light
Beautiful, finite

Even the iron still fears the rot
Hiding from something I cannot stop
Walking on shadows, I can't lead him back
Buckled on the floor when night comes along
Daddy's left and Mama won't come home

You poor thing
Sweet, mourning lamb
There's nothing you can do
It's already been done

What fear a man like you brings upon
A woman like me
Please don't look at me
I can see it in your eyes
He keeps looking at me
Tell me, what have you done
Stop, stop, stop, make it stop, stop
Make it stop
Make it stop, I've had enough
Stop, stop, stop, stop

I am the face of love's rage
I am the face of love's rage

Blessed be the Daughters of Cain, bound to suffering eternal through the sins of their fathers committed long before their conception
Blessed be their whore mothers, tired and angry waiting with bated breath in a ferry that will never move again
Blessed be the children, each and every one come to know their god through some senseless act of violence
Blessed be you, girl, promised to me by a man who can only feel hatred and contempt towards you
I am no good nor evil, simply I am, and I have come to take what is mine
I was there in the dark when you spilled your first blood
I am here now as you run from me still
Run then, child
You can't hide from me forever

"Sun Bleached Flies"

Sun bleached flies sitting in the windowsill
Waiting for the day they escape
They talk all about that money and how their babies are always changing while they're breathing in the poison of the pain
What I wouldn't give to be in Church this Sunday
Listening to the choir, so heartfelt, all singing
God loves you, but not enough to save you
So, baby girl, good luck taking care of yourself

So I said fine, 'cause that's how my daddy raised me
If they strike once then you just hit 'em twice as hard
But in the end, if I bend under the weight that they gave me
Then this heart would break and fall as twice as far

We all know how it goes
The more it hurts, the less it shows
But I still feel like they all know, and that's why I can never go back home
And I spend my life watching it go by from the sidelines
And God, I've tried, but I think it's about time I put up a fight

But I don't mind 'cause that's how my daddy raised me (How my daddy raised me)
If they strike once then you just hit 'em twice as hard
But I always knew that in the end no one was coming to save me
So I just prayed and I keep praying and praying and praying

If it's meant to be then it will be
So I met him there and told him I believe
Singing if it's meant to be then it'll be
I forgive it all as it comes back to me (Back to me)
If it's meant to be then it will be
So I met him there and told him I believe (I believe, yeah)
Singing if it's meant to be then it will be (Oh, oh)
I forgive it all as it comes back to me (It comes back to me)
If it's meant to be then it'll be (It'll be, it'll be, it'll be)
So I met him there and told him I believe (Yeah)
Singing if it's meant to be then it will be
I forgive it all as it comes back to me (Oh)

I'm still praying for that house in Nebraska
By the highway, out on the edge of town
Dancing with the windows open
I can't let go when something's broken
It's all I know and it's all I want now

"Strangers"

"God is telling you and I there is death, for all of us
But then we find that the scriptures also tell us that we have a great promise, that there is a better place for those who believe in the lord Jesus Christ"

In your basement, I grow cold
Thinking back to what I was always told
Don't talk to strangers or you might fall in love
Freezer bride, your sweet divine
You devour like smoked bovine hide
How funny, I never considered myself tough

You're so handsome, walking over to me now

I tried to be good
Am I no good
Am I no good
Am I no good
With my memory restricted to a Polaroid in evidence
I just wanted to be yours
Can I be yours
Can I be yours
Can I be yours
If I'm turning in your stomach and I'm making you feel sick

When my mother sees me on the side
Of a milk carton in Winn-Dixie's dairy aisle
She'll cry and wait up for me
We'll make love in your attic all night
Euphoric in some strange delight
I'm happier here cause he told me I should be
You're so handsome when I'm all over your mouth

I tried to be good
Am I no good
Am I no good
Am I no good
With my memory restricted to a Polaroid in evidence
I just wanted to be yours
Can I be yours
Can I be yours
Can I be yours
If I'm turning in your stomach and I'm making you feel sick

Am I making you feel sick
Am I making you feel
Am I making you feel sick
Am I making you feel
Am I making you feel sick
Am I making you feel sick
Am I making you feel sick
Am I making you feel sick
Am I

Found you just to tell you that I made it real far
And that I never blamed you for loving me the way that you did while you were torn apart
I would still wait with you there
Don't think about it too hard
Or you'll never sleep a wink at night again
Don't worry 'bout me and these green eyes
Mama, just know that I love you (I do)
And I'll see you when you get here

"Famous Last Words (An Ode To Eaters)"

My lips are still burnt from kissing your face
And feverish forehead, the blood that you waste
I'm tired of this, watching it wash out of you

I beg you to stay, just 'til tomorrow
I'll clean up the bathtub and we'll leave the state
Mouth open, silent and blue

And in the heat, it searched for you
You were the one I'd have starved with
'Til I can't hold out no more
You were the one I'd come looking for
Over and over and over again

Look at me baby, dead in my eyes
It's the end of our holiday, but it isn't goodbye
Carry me with you all of the time

Eat of me baby, skin to the bone
Body on body, until I'm all gone
But I'm with you, inside

"Powerline Valley"

When I met you there underneath the powerlines, I'd start to cry
To wash you away
Cause I'm a goddamn fool and I knew you'd ruin my life
In the fever dream
Of a summer haze

I was 19
You were 21
My mama said she loved you
She wasn't the only one
You lost yours back
When you were 15
You forgot softness
And what the word means

But I've come to know you like you forgot
You knew yourself

Gave you my virginity under the overpass
Static tearing up your daddy's stereo
You were pouring sweat and I was bleeding out on your seats
But we just laughed to death and held each other close

Valleys of powerlines
We drive by day and night
Stretching for miles away from here
We talk of runnin'
Straight shot just gunnin'
Until we're out there in the clear

It's been hard here for you
But I know, I'm trying too
All alone in this town
In this Alabama wild
Nothing stops if not for you
But I'll always love you and you know I will

We spent September on the backroads
Shotgunnin' warm bud lights down a sinner's rabbit hole
By the fire, taking off my dirty blouse
I let your hands do things that no one needs to know

And I love you like you won't ever know cause you get too caught up in what they tell you to

I'll never forget the night or the paper in his hand when you found your daddy there swinging from the ceiling fan
By that belt you fucking hated
That left the marks I don't ask about
All I know is I've never seen you hurt as bad as you do right now

Now you crush up pills to forget
And you crush up more to sleep
You crushed yourself into a ghost
That I can't reach when you're inside me
And I take each blow you give me
And I keep them as a gift
At least you can still bear to touch me
And when you throw you never miss
It's been hard here for you
But I know, I'm trying too
All alone in this town
In this Alabama wild
Nothing stops if not for you
But I'll always love you and you know I will

You'd been gone for days when I
Heard the news that you'd been found
Shotgun in hand in your daddy's field
Sprayed out all over the ground one last time
I wish we'd have left while we still could
But I'll do what I promised you I would
And let those powerlines take me somewhere

It's been hard here for you
But I know, I'm trying too
All alone in this town
In this Alabama wild
Nothing stops if not for you
But I'll always love you and you know I will

When I met you there underneath the powerlines, I'd start to cry
And then I'd let you in
Cause I'm a goddamn fool and I let you ruin my life
But if I had the chance
I'd do it all again

"Two Children In A Motel"

There's been a stain in the carpet since the day our father took those pills
And nothing's felt real since then
We haven't seen the ocean since two days after we were born
And now you say you wish they'd thrown you in

The red and white stripes above our bed have started tearing
And I'm just waiting for the stars to fall through
They let this town fall down around us like we always thought it would
But we never left, even though we knew

You and I are not in love, we are just the same
Two children in a motel making love in our own grave
And we are not embarrassed, but we're filled with worms and dirt
We were better off dying with her at birth

And I don't care what girls you hurt as long as you come home to me
'Cause I can't be alone for long
You would've died if I didn't hide you when the army came to take you
You can try, but you can't tell me I'm wrong

You're the only one I'll let touch me
'Cause no one makes me feel safe like you do
All these dreams of violation starting to come true
Deep down, I don't wanna say no to you, no to you

You and I are not in love, we are just the same
Two children in a motel, making love in our own grave
We are not embarrassed, but we're filled with worms and dirt
We were better off dying with her at birth

"Die Young"

Run with the devil, go ahead run free
Run with the devil and dream
Smoke that cigarette, puff those rings
Blow it in my face as I breathe
It's alright now, you're just high now
You'll be fine now, you're just high now

Look at your mama, now she's crying
'Cause she thinks her baby's dying
Don't put up a fight, she just wants to hold you tight
And look at your daddy, he hates lying
Tried to help you, but he's sick of trying
Look at your life, he just wants to make it right
And you got everything and more than enough
If you could have anything, what would you want

You say, "I wanna die young"
Wanna die young
You say, "I wanna die young"
Wanna die young

Sleep with the devil, go dance with him
It's your life, do what you want to
Baby, why you so locked up in lies
Don't you know you could have the truth
You say I'm boring, so you ignore me
You hear the phone ring, so you ignore me

Look at your mama, now she's crying
'Cause she thinks her baby's dying
Don't put up a fight, she just wants to hold you tight
And look at your daddy, he hates lying
Tried to help you, but he's sick of trying
Look at your life, he just wants to make it right
And you got everything and more than enough
If you could have anything, what would you want

You say, "I wanna die young"
Wanna die young
You say, "I wanna die young"
Wanna die young

You say "I don't know how I lost myself"
With a bottle at the bottom of an ashtray
Smoking my regrets and realizing what I need to do is pray

And I know I've got more than enough
And I think I know now what I really want

And I think I want love, wanna find love
And I wanna be loved, wanna find love
And I sure as hell don't wanna die young
Don't wanna die young, wanna die young

"Good Hurt"

I know I'm impatient
Bite your tongue or I'll do it for you
You can taste hesitation
Mouth to mouth conversation
And I've even tried medication
Cold hearted frustration
You can call it foundation
I'll call you when I'm wasted

Oh, I should know better
Oh, I should know better

All I really want is that good hurt
I know in my head I could do better
No one else compares to who I had first
All I really want is that good hurt
That good hurt
That good hurt

Lied when I said I love you
Didn't mean to say it but I
Know you're not delusional
Guess that I was manipulative
You can call me Medusa
Bite you good but I'll leave you colder
Use me just like I used you
Till it's over

Oh, I should know better
Oh, I should know better

All I really want is that good hurt
I know in my head I could do better
No one else compares to who I had first
All I really want is that good hurt
That good hurt
That good hurt

I guess I will lay here while you move
And think it through but I can't help but wish that it was you
On my body, make good hurt stay
I just wanna feel that pain

All I really want is that good hurt
I know in my head I could do better
No one else compares to who I had first
All I really want is that good hurt
That good hurt
That good hurt

"Meantime"

I first left to a summer camp
Feel my skeleton, can you make my brittle bones strong
Remember when we talked so long
Quiet behind bedroom walls
The light made your eyes so big

And I keep my doubts in the back of my mind
And I still love you in the meantime
Cut me slack while I figure it out
And I still love you in the meantime

In the meantime
Can I love you in the meantime

And I keep my doubts in the back of my mind
And I still love you in the meantime
Cut me slack while I figure it out
And I still love you in the meantime

In the meantime
Can I love you in the meantime
In the meantime
Can I love you in the meantime

Twist me, licorice
Speak with your fingertips
Tell me what you want me to do
Can you meet me by the swimming pool
After hours, when the air is cool
I've got things I don't know how to say

Can I love you in the meantime
Can I love you in the meantime

"Sugar High"

Chocolate covered lover, you've never been so sweet before
Open our bodies, I quietly knock on your door
I-I-I just wanna sweet talk for awhile
Whisper all the things I absolutely adore
About your smile, it's like I'm in a candy store
Oh-h-h, I love your sugar coating words

Maybe it's the way the honey drips off of your lips
Maybe it's the taste of your caramel apple kiss

And your heart is so sweet, all that sugar loving, it belongs to me
Candy man, you are mine
You know how you get me, get me sugar high
High, oh, high
High, oh, high

Your cotton candy voice melts in my mouth as you speak
Beautiful boy, your words are made of poetry
I-I-I could listen to you all day

Maybe it's the way you laffy taffy love
Maybe it's the way you run your hands up my back

And your heart is so sweet, all that sugar loving, it belongs to me
Candy man, you are mine
You know how you get me, get me sugar high
High, oh, high
High, oh, high

Maybe it's the way you lay me down at night
Or how you turn November into hot summer July

And your heart is so sweet, all that sugar loving, it belongs to me
Candy man, you are mine
You know how you get me, get me sugar high

"Bad For You"

You know that I won't hold you back
When you think of things you shouldn't
Things you want to do to me
Bare skin to sink my teeth in
Wrap my tongue around you as I hold you with my lungs

I bet you wonder what I'm doing when I'm alone in my room
When I'm alone in my room
And darling, I'm telling you it comes easy when I'm thinking about you
When I'm thinking about you

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you

Goddess, I'll be your goddess
Lace your fingers round my neck, it's pleasure I can't take

Bet I know exactly what you're doing when you're alone in your room
When you're alone in your room
Darling, tell me if you're having trouble and I'm sure I could help you
I'm sure I could help you

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you

Blood on your back
I give you your pride
I am all yours and you are all mine

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you

"Femininomenon"

Same old story, time again
Got so close but then you lost it
Should've listened to your friends
About his girlfriend back in Boston
You sent him pictures and playlists and phone sex
He disappeared from the second that you said
"Let's get coffee, let's meet up"
I'm so sick of online love
And I don't understand
Why can't any man

Hit it like...

So let's say it's working out
You pretend to love his mother
Lying to your friends about
How he's such a goddamn good lover
Stuck in the suburbs, you're folding his laundry
Got what you wanted so stop feeling sorry
Crying at the nail salon
I'm so sick of online love
And I don't understand
Why can't any man

Hit it like...
Get it hot...
Make a bitch...
It's a fem...
Hit it like...

"Red Wine Supernova"

She was a playboy
Brigitte Bardot
She showed me things
I didn't know
She did it right there
Out on the deck

In the side of my neck

Mini skirt and my go-go boots

Let's make this bed get squeaky

Baby, why don't you come over

"After Midnight"

My mama said nothing good happens
When it's late and you're dancing alone
She's in my head saying it's not attractive
Wearing that dress and red lipstick

This is what I wanted, this is what I like
I've been a good, good girl for a long time
But baby, I like flirting, a lover by my side
Can't be a good, good girl even if I tried

'Cause after midnight
I'm feeling kinda freaky, maybe it's the club lights
I kinda wanna kiss your girlfriend if you don't mind
I love a little drama, let's start a bar fight

'Cause everything good happens after midnight
I'm feeling kinda freaky, maybe it's the moonlight
I kinda wanna kiss your boyfriend if you don't mind
I love a little uh-huh, let's watch the sunrise
'Cause everything good happens after

I really want your hands on my body
A slow dance, baby, let's get it on
That's my type of fun, that's my kind of party
Your hands on my body, your hot hands

This is what I wanted, this is what I like
I've been a good, good girl for a long time
But baby, I like flirting, a lover by my side
Can't be a good, good girl even if I tried

'Cause after midnight
I'm feeling kinda freaky, maybe it's the club lights
I kinda wanna kiss your girlfriend if you don't mind
I love a little drama, let's start a bar fight

'Cause everything good happens after midnight
I'm feeling kinda freaky, maybe it's the moonlight
I kinda wanna kiss your boyfriend if you don't mind
I love a little uh-huh, let's watch the sunrise

'Cause everything good happens after

"Coffee"

Can't meet you for dinner at the Italian place
It's where I met your family, some words were exchanged
I'd suggest the jazz bar on MaryAnn Street, but
You'd buy me a drink, and we know where that leads, so

I'll meet you for coffee 'cause if we have wine
You'll say that you want me, I know that's a lie
If I didn't love you, it would be fine
I'll meet you for coffee, only for coffee
Nowhere else is safe, every place leads back to your place

You said let's do the park, 'cause I love the park
That may be true, but God forbid it gets dark
Here come the excuses that fuel the illusions
But I'd rather feel something than nothing at all, so

I'll meet you for coffee 'cause if we have wine
You'll say that you're sorry, I know that's a lie
If I didn't trust you, it would be fine
I'll meet you for coffee, only for coffee
Nowhere else is safe, every place leads back to your-

We've done this before
And I don't need it anymore

So let's not do coffee, let's not even try
It's better we leave it and give it some time
If I didn't love you, it would be fine
'Cause If we do coffee, it's never just coffee
It's never just coffee

"Casual"

My friends call me a loser
'Cause I'm still hanging around
I've heard so many rumors
That I'm just a girl that you bang on your couch
I thought you thought of me better
Someone you couldn't lose
You said, "We're not together"
So now when we kiss, I have anger issues

You said, "Baby, no attachment"
But we're...

Knee deep in the passenger seat and you're eating me out
Is it casual now
Two weeks and your mom invites me to her house on Long Beach
Is it casual now
I know what you tell your friends
It's casual, if it's casual now
But baby, get me off again
If it's casual, it's casual now

Dumb love, I love being stupid
Dream of us in a year
Maybe we'd have an apartment
And you'd show me off to your friends at the pier

I know, "Baby, no attachment"
But we're...

Knee deep in the passenger seat and you're eating me out
Is it casual now
Two weeks and your mom invites me to her house on Long Beach
Is it casual now
I know what you tell your friends
It's casual, if it's casual now
But baby, get me off again
If it's casual, oh, oh, oh

It's hard being casual
When my favorite bra lives in your dresser
It's hard being casual
When I'm on the phone talking down your sister
And I try to be the chill girl that
Holds her tongue and gives you space
I try to be the chill girl but
Honestly, I'm not

Knee deep in the passenger seat and you're eating me out
Two weeks and your mom invites me to her Long Beach house
I know what you tell your friends
Baby, get me off again
I fucked you in the bathroom when we went to dinner
Your parents at the table, you wonder why I'm bitter
Bragging to your friends I get off when you hit it
I hate to tell the truth but I'm sorry dude you didn't
I hate that I let this drag on so long, now I hate myself
I hate that I let this drag on so long, you can go to hell

"Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl"

You know what they say, "Never waste a Friday night on a first date"
But there I was, in my heels with my hair straight
And so I take him to this bar, this man wouldn't dance
He didn't ask a single question
And he was wearing these fugly jeans
It doesn't matter though, he doesn't have what it takes to be
With a girl like me

Not overdramatic, I know what I want
We're leaving the planet and you can't come

Uh-huh, I'm through with all these hyper mega bummer boys like you
Oh yeah, I need a super graphic ultra modern girl like me
We're hot, we're drunk, wow, look at her moving, baby, she's the one
Oh yeah, I need a super graphic ultra modern girl like me

Telling secrets there on the mattress
Wearing nothing but glitter and lashes
At every party we're the party, shaking our asses
Making out while the world collapses

Not overdramatic, I know what I want
We're leaving the planet and you can't come

Uh-huh, I'm through with all these hyper mega bummer boys like you
Oh yeah, I need a super graphic ultra modern girl like me
We're hot, we're drunk, wow, look at her moving, baby, she's the one
Oh yeah, I need a super graphic ultra modern girl like me
(Shake it for me)

Get up off your feet, get up on that bar
Walk that walk from Tokyo to New York
With everything you feel and everything you are
Walk that walk, flash the camera, flash the camera, flash the camera, you're a star

Uh-huh, I'm through with all these hyper mega bummer boys like you
Oh yeah, I need a super graphic ultra modern girl like me
We're hot, we're drunk, wow, look at her moving, baby, she's the one
Oh yeah, I need a super graphic ultra modern
Ooh, you got me la-la-la-ing
Hyper-sexy top to bottom
Girl like me

"HOT TO GO"

Five, six
Five, six, seven, eight

I don't want the world, but I'll take this city
Who can blame a girl Call me hot, not pretty

H-O-T-T-O-G-O
You can take me hot to go
Oh, yeah
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
You can take me hot to go

Whew, it's hot in here
Is anyone else hot
Woo, you comin' home with me
Okay, it's hot
I'll call the cab

"My Kink Is Karma"

We broke up on a Tuesday
Kicked me out with the rent paid
Ruined my credit, stole my cute aesthetic
Who knew that we'd let it
Get this bad when it ended

It's comical, bridges you burn
Karma's real, hope it's your turn
I heard from Katie
You're losing it lately
Moved back with your parents
And date girls who're eighteen

It's hot when you have a meltdown
In the front of your house and you're getting kicked out
It's hot when you're drinking downtown
And you're getting called out 'cause you're running your mouth
Oh, God
And it's coming around, yeah, it's coming around, yeah, it's coming around
Oh, God, oh, God
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching

You ruining your life
You losing your mind
You dyeing your hair
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching
You crashing your car
You breaking your heart
You thinking I care
People say I'm jealous but my kink is karma

Wishing you the best, in the worst way
Using your distress as foreplay
Six months since April and I'm doing better
No need to be hateful in your fake Gucci sweater

But it's hot when you have a meltdown
In the front of your house and you're getting kicked out
It's hot when you're drinking downtown
And you're getting called out 'cause you're running your mouth
Oh, God
And it's coming around, yeah, it's coming around, yeah, it's coming around
Oh, God, oh, God
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching

You ruining your life
You losing your mind
You dyeing your hair
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching
You crashing your car
You breaking your heart
You thinking I care
People say I'm jealous but my kink is karma

It's hot when you're going through hell
And you're hating yourself, I'm feeling myself
It's hot when you know that you're caught
And you're getting pissed off, it's getting me off
It's hot, it's hot
Oh, God, oh, God
Oh, God
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching

You ruining your life
You losing your mind
You dyeing your hair
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching
You crashing your car
You breaking your heart
You thinking I care
People say I'm jealous but my kink is karma

"Picture You"

Draw the blinds, light every candle
Slip off my pretty dress, down my chest when I think of you
Every night, both lips on the mirror
It's ritualistic, counting lipstick stains where you should be

Oh, I need you around
I'm getting close now

Do you picture me like I picture you
Am I in the frame from your point of view
Do you feel the same I'm too scared to say
Half of the things I do when I picture you

So tell me now, all your perversions
Tell me now
Am I doing research in a mini skirt
Am I
At the library in your hometown

Oh, I need you around
I'm getting close now

Do you picture me like I picture you
Am I in the frame from your point of view
Do you feel the same I'm too scared to say
Half of the things I do when I picture you
When I picture you

Do you picture me like I picture you
Am I in the frame from your point of view
Do you feel the same I'm too scared to say
Half of the things I do when I picture you

"Kaleidoscope"

Here we go again
Everything is fine
I guess we could pretend
We didn't cross a line
But ever since that day
Everything has changed
The way I write your name
The cursive letter A
Whenever it may be
That you go on your way
If you really wanna leave
I'll never make you stay
Whatever you decide
I will understand
And it will all be fine
Just go back to being friends

And love is a kaleidoscope
How it works we'll never know
And even all the change
Is somehow all the same
Turnin' to the left and right
Colors shining in your eye
And even upside down
It's beautiful somehow
It's never just a shape alone
Love is a kaleidoscope

And if you ever find
Someone who could write
A better song for you
Well I'd love to see them try
Put it all in words
And sing it all in tune
There's no one else who could
The only one is you
And if you change your mind
I will understand
And it'll just take time
To go back to being friends

And love is a kaleidoscope
How it works we'll never know
And even all the change
Is somehow all the same
Turning to the left and right
Colors shining in your eye
And even upside down
It's beautiful somehow

Every color of the rainbow
Don't be afraid to hold it close
It's never just a shape alone
Love is a kaleidoscope

"Pink Pony Club"

I know you wanted me to stay
But I can't ignore the crazy visions of me in LA
And I heard that there's a special place
Where boys and girls can all be queens every single day

I'm having wicked dreams
Of leaving Tennessee
Oh, Santa Monica
I swear it's calling me
Won't make my mama proud
It's gonna cause a scene
She sees her baby girl
I know she's gonna scream

God, what have you done
You're a pink pony girl
And you dance at the club
Oh mama, I'm just having fun
On the stage in my heels
It's where I belong down at the
Pink Pony Club
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony Club
I'm gonna keep on dancing down in
West Hollywood
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony Club, Pink Pony Club

I'm up and jaws are on the floor
Lovers in the bathroom and a line outside the door
Blacklights and a mirrored disco ball
Every night's another reason why I left it all

I thank my wicked dreams
A year from Tennessee
Oh, Santa Monica
You've been too good to me
Won't make my mama proud
It's gonna cause a scene
She sees her baby girl
I know she's gonna scream

God, what have you done
You're a pink pony girl
And you dance at the club
Oh mama, I'm just having fun
On the stage in my heels
It's where I belong down at the
Pink Pony club
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony club
I'm gonna keep on dancing down in
West Hollywood
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony club, Pink Pony club

Don't think I've left you all behind
Still love you and Tennessee
You're always on my mind
And mama, every Saturday
I can hear your southern drawl a thousand miles away, saying

God, what have you done
You're a pink pony girl
And you dance at the club
Oh mama, I'm just having fun
On the stage in my heels
It's where I belong down at the
Pink Pony Club
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony Club
I'm gonna keep on dancing down in
West Hollywood
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony Club, Pink Pony Club

I'm gonna keep on dancing
I'm gonna keep on dancing

"Naked In Manhattan"

Hi, it's Chappell, I know you just landed
And I know you're probably busy but
I would love to see you so
Call me when you can

New crush, high school love again
The rush of slumber party kissing
Don't touch, I'll never cross the line
So I pushed you down a million times
I'd love if you knew you were on my mind
Constant like cicadas in the summertime
Boys suck and girls I've never tried
And we both know we're getting drunk tonight

Touch me, baby, put your lips on mine
Could go to hell but we'll probably be fine
I know you want it, baby, you can have it
Oh, I've never done it, let's make it cinematic
Like that one sex scene that's in Mulholland Drive
I wanna know, baby, what is it like
I know you want it, baby, you can have it
Oh, I've never done it, naked in Manhattan

Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)
Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)

A pisces who knew that we were so aligned
When I sing that Lana song, it makes you cry
Mean Girls, we watch it every night
And we both have a crush on Regina George
You love peach and ice cream
Bedazzled, Chanel rings
In New York, you can try things
An inch away from more than just friends

Touch me, baby, put your lips on mine
Could go to hell but we'll probably be fine
I know you want it, baby, you can have it
Oh, I've never done it, naked in Manhattan

Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)
Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)

Red lips and lip gloss
French kissing and crystals
But don't try and it's my loss
An inch away from more than just friends

Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)
Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)

Won't you fucking touch me
I just want to touch you (Naked in Manhattan)
I want more than you know (Naked in Manhattan)
Oh, oh, oh (Naked in Manhattan)
Naked in Manhattan

"California"

I stretched myself across four states
New lands, west coast, where my dreams lay
I trade amber clay roads for the
Sea foam and the endless sun rays

'Cause I was never told that I wasn't gonna get
The things I want the most
But people always say, "If it hasn't happened yet
Then maybe you should go"

Come get me out of California
No leaves are brown
I miss the seasons in Missouri
My dying town
Thought I'd be cool in California
I'd make you proud
To think I almost had it going
But I let you down

Too hard, to find reasons to stay
Even true love could not persuade

'Cause I was never told that I wasn't gonna get
The things I want the most
But people always say, "If it hasn't happened yet
Then maybe you should go"

Come get me out of California
No leaves are brown
I miss the seasons in Missouri
My dying town
Thought I'd be cool in California
I'd make you proud
To think I almost had it going
But I let you down

Come get me out
Come get me out
Come get me out
Come get me out

Come get me out of California
No leaves are brown
I miss the seasons in Missouri
My dying town
Thought I'd be cool in California
I'd make you proud
To think I almost had it going
But I let you down

"Guilty Pleasure"

Learned it on the internet
Wheels turning in my head
Think back to what you said
And I turn red, I'm turning red

Wild thoughts that make me melt
A good hit below the belt
Sometimes I scare myself
But I can't help what I can't help

So shame on me and shame on you
I fantasize what we would do
And how would he taste and the way you move
Oh, some good girls do bad things too

I want this like a cigarette
Can we drag it out and never quit And
Oh my God, you are heaven-sent
With your dirty mind, yeah, you're perverted
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure

Feels like pornography watching you try on jeans
You're a pothead, you're a cinephile
It's been awhile since you turned up the dial

So shame on me, shame on you
I fantasize what we would do
And how would it taste, the way you move
Oh, some good girls do bad things too

I want this like a cigarette
Can we drag it out and never quit And
Oh my God, you are heaven-sent
With your dirty mind, yeah, you're perverted
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure

You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure, pleasure, pleasure, pleasure...

"Bitter"

Oh God, tell me that I'm not insane
With a toy gun hanging in my mouth
I'm made of jade and I'm feeling pretty jaded
It's a problem that I'll never ever figure out

Take pills for your double black eyes
Said I pack a punch and give it to ya
Don't promise you'll do better next time
I know never to believe ya

I love being bitter
It makes me feel better
Bitter feels better than tryna get better and I
Yes, I love being bitter
But it makes me feel weathered
Now I'm sick in the head and it's not even my fault
Now I'm sick in the head and it's not even my fault

I used to laugh like the cartoon children
I wasn't always this way
Once sweet like an orange creamsicle
Or lemon icing on the cake

Bite hard when I try to be nice
I know exactly what you want
Cut clean when I twist that knife
No one falls for the villain

But I love being bitter
Yeah, it makes me feel better
Bitter feels better than tryna get better and I
Yes, I love being bitter
But it makes me feel weathered
Now I'm sick in the head and it's not even my fault
Now I'm sick in the head and it's not even my fault

I'm unaware just give me some time, I'm
Having trouble fighting wars in my mind
Take it easy, take it easy

I don't care that I'm on your shelf 'cause
I'm pretty good at talking to myself
Take it easy, take it easy

Take it easy
Take it easy
Take it easy

Yes, I love being bitter
'Cause it makes me feel better
Now I'm sick in the head and I think it's my fault
Now I'm sick in the head and I think it's my fault

"Love Me Anyway"

I love you because you have those Polaroids of me inside your nightstand
And I love you because you're understanding when I'm too shy to show my skin

Sometimes I forget, wasn't always this way
It's hard to admit, I was the one to blame

When I met you at summer camp
I would never give you the chance
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
Autumn came and December went
Turned you down at your high school dance
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway

I love you because when I say "I don't wanna talk" you always call me
And I love you because you lead me back to bed when I wander in my sleep

Sometimes I forget, wasn't always this way
It's hard to admit, I was the one to blame

When I met you at summer camp
I would never give you the chance
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
Autumn came and December went
Turned you down at your high school dance
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway

And after all this time, you were right
Can we take more Polaroids for you to hide

When I met you at summer camp
I would never give you the chance
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
Autumn came and December went
Turned you down at your high school dance
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
Anyway

"School Nights"

I'm feeling childish
When you draw tattoos on my forearm
Pop bubblegum too loud
We got them preachin' that we're hell-bound

But I don't think we are unless you do

I wanna be a kid with you
Talk slow on a school night
And you can disregard my virgin ears and say what you like
You wanna win me over now
Impress me like a school fight
And I triple-dog dare ya
To pinky-promise that you'll never lie
Ooh ooh oh

We light firecrackers in the middle of the street
You hear them yellin' at us
But you, listen to me
As I pour my voice in your soul
You say "goddamn let's never get old," and
I agree

I wanna be a kid with you
Talk slow on a school night
And you can disregard my virgin ears and say what you like
You wanna win me over now
Impress me like a school fight
And I triple-dog dare ya
To pinky-promise that you'll never lie
Ooh ooh oh

Make me a ring out of clover flowers
Sit in a teacup, spin for hours
I'm official, I know I'm official
Got a badge to your club and
One has initials
You become King Kong
You're King Kong
You grow up so strong
You're so strong
But I wannna stay young
Yeah, I wanna stay young with you
Yeah, I wanna stay young
Yeah, I wanna stay young with you
Wanna stay young
I wanna stay young with you
Wanna stay young
I wanna stay young

I wanna be a kid with you
Talk slow on a school night
And you can disregard my virgin ears and say what you like
You want to win me over now
Impress me like a school fight
And I triple-dog dare ya
To pinky-promise that you'll never lie
Ooh ooh oh

"Everyone I've Never Met"

People make me nervous
Especially in malls
They sprint by skinny models
That are nearly ten feet tall
Highways make me fidget
There are way too many cars
And I'm sure I'd like the drivers
If we pulled aside to talk

But from my window they are just a bumper and a light
And I can't see their eyes

I get my food delivered
And my books sent to my door
And I don't talk to people anymore

Barstools make me sweaty
When there's someone I don't know
I probably look so stupid
Climbing up there on my own
And the man behind the bar
Is probably lovely with his kids
And I am just the ass who didn't order a drink

I kissed a girl from the internet
And her lips were cold
But I don't talk to people anymore

I get my food delivered
And my books sent to my door
But I don't talk to people anymore

I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met

"Grown Up"

I can remember the feeling of being small
Praying to a God I don't believe in to grow tall

Can you remember the evenings of your youth
Losing track of time, losing count of hours
Losing your balance, and then losing a tooth

Where does it go
So fast and so slow
And so, you notice you got old

Where does it go
Like how spring melts the snow
One day, you're living on your own

I can remember believing
That my parents were gods
And yes, there's comfort in people
But fear in a faith that's lost

Oh, what a wonderful feeling
To own and operate your life
Oh, what a terrible burden
All my decisions are mine

Where does it go
So fast and so slow
And so, you notice you got old

Where does it go
Like how spring melts the snow
One day, you're living on your own

"No More Words"

No more words left
I have no more words left
There's no more ways to say it
I tried my best and I'll swear it, but there's no more words

No more words left
I have no more words left
I'll try my best to show it, and I know that you know it, but there's no more words

And my only concern is that if I have used them all
And they still aren't enough, then you'll never know how I loved you
Ooh

No more days left
I have no more days to take care of
Already promised you forever
Fuck marriage, vows, that's better
Now there's no more words

And my only concern is that if I have used them all
And they still aren't enough, then you'll never know how I loved you
Ooh

"Prayer"

Last night I wrote a prayer
To the water in my head
Read the book my mother read

See I don't believe in God
At least not one that's not
As human as me
And anyone, that ever was

See I have to believe
There's some kind of deity
In lonely eyes
In looming trees
I can't count upon
Heaven or hell or law
But I'm scared and lonely
Amen

In history there's faith
When children die people pray
And that's just human nature

It's my instinct to believe
There is something more than me
But I can't name what I can't see

See I have to believe
There's some kind of deity
In broken bones
In skin that bleeds
I can't count upon
Heaven or hell or law
When I'm scared and lonely
Amen

Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen

"For Now"

My first week back at school
I went to the hospital
Because my spine was inflamed

My family made the drive
At 1 o'clock at night
To bring me home again

A couple of months went by
I would often cry
Told my parents when I stopped avoiding calls

They surprised me then
Said they would drive again
If I needed nothing more than to feel like I was small

So I'll stay for now
''Cause I'm tired out
But there's something 'bout the snow

I guess I'll stay for now
Just 'til I make it out
Until I say that I no longer want to go

I asked my friend last night
If he wouldn't mind
Driving an hour outside of town

He came to pick me up
Didn't make me talk at all
Dropped me off, said goodnight, and turned around

So I'll stay for now
''Cause I'm tired out
But there's something 'bout the snow

I guess I'll stay for now
Just 'til I make it out
Until I say that I no longer wanna go

I don't wanna go
Though I can't see it
I don't wanna go
Repeat 'til I believe it

So I'll stay for now
'Cause I'm tired out
But there's something 'bout the snow

I guess I'll stay for now
Just 'til I make it out
Until I say that I no longer want to go

"Tommy"

Strong as an ox, he was tough as a bull
He had stories and poems and dirty jokes

I came in running with my brother in tow
We had dirt on our knees, climbing on his feet to show him

He hardly spoke and he cheated at poker
If someone got angry, he'd crack a joke

Didn't always go over, but the kids would laugh
Then he'd play in the corner 'till he closed the gap

Oh Tommy I love that one
You used to sing it when you were young
Play it again, my love
For the kids to remember when they grow up

I miss my grandfather, the way that we were
Singing out of time, cause he never finishes words

A house full of instruments, now safely with his kids
And his music in my bones and in my body when I was built

Oh Tommy I love that one
You used to sing it when you were young
Play it again, my love
For the kids to remember when they grow up

Tommy I love that one
You used to sing it when you were young
Play it again, my love
For the kids to remember us

"Understood"

I'll visit my family
To give muscle memory a break
Cause I've been learning since I was a baby
To take on their pain

I'll visit my family
In living rooms that don't get cold
Cause blankets and body heat can't be compared
When it only took you a week to grow old

Love can be understood
I'm sick of attachments I recently learned
I can't relax, and I'm scared of myself
I'm scared for my health
Tell me you'll take me back home

Old friends are precious
But once, all your old friends were new
It takes years of tense shoulders
When growing a person into something that you're used to

I'm sick of the feeling
That nothing will ever stand still
I wish I could stop

Love can be understood
I'm sick of attachments I recently learned
I can't relax, and I'm scared of myself
I'm scared for my health
Tell me you'll take me back home

When I get sad, I go back to my grandmother's house
And picture my mother putting on her wedding dress
Posing beside the same couch
That I am lying on
It helps to remember I took generations to make

Love can be understood
I'm sick of attachments I recently learned
I can't relax, and I'm scared of myself
I'm scared for my health
Tell me you'll take me back home

Love can be understood
I'm sick of attachments I recently learned
I can't relax, and I'm scared of myself
I'm scared for my health
Tell me you'll take me back home

"Coming Back To Me"

I used to wake to the morning
And feel like the world was created for me
I used to wait for the morning so eagerly
Sometimes I just couldn't sleep

It might have started the first time I got really sick
And my mum wasn't there
Three years of college and I had forgotten
How I used to find living rare

But it's all coming back to me now
It's all coming back to me now
It's all coming back to me

Last week I wondered if dying would feel
Like the stories the Catholic Church told
But I used to talk to my mother about how
I just couldn't wait to get old

And it's all coming back to me now
It's all coming back to me now
It's all coming back to me

I used to wake to the morning
And feel like the world was created for me

"5am"

5am in a city that I don't know
Wet hair from swimming in normal clothes
The smell in the air right before it storms
Old feelings with "Pardon me, I'm just stoned"

Lying down in the middle of childhood streets
Not quite recalling falling asleep
The first day of fall 'cause it makes you breathe
The odd time you're tired
But you like how it feels

You like how it feels
You like how it feels
You like how it feels
Like how it feels
You like how it feels
Like how it feels
Like how it feels
How it feels
How it feels

"I Just Don't Think That You Like Me That Much Anymore"

I just don't think that you like me that much anymore
And you'll say you're busy, but it's not the same as before
And no, I'm not angry, I think that I'm just feeling sore
'Cause the truth is that you just don't like me that much anymore

I just don't think that you think about me the same way
And don't lie through your teeth 'cause you know that I know what you'll say
Just leave it unspoken and leave me unsure
You stopped calling first, not that I'm keeping score
And the truth is that you just don't like me that much anymore

And I'm so embarrassed
I'm acting like a little kid
Passive-aggressive and
Practicing little tricks
Watch me, I learned this for you
Look at the things I can do

I just don't think that you like me that much anymore
There's nothing quite wrong and I guess I can't really be sure
But there's sick in my gut, and fine, I'm keeping score
And there's numbers and figures that I can't ignore
And the truth is that you just don't like me that much anymore

The truth is that you just don't like me that much

"To Me"

If you said "speak", then I'd spill
If you said "stop", I'd be still
If you jump, then I jump
Down their throat and I go for the kill

When you say "leave", I run
You said, "Forgive me", I said, "You did nothing wrong"
'Cause when you lie, then I lie
On your back while you sleep to the sound of a gun

And I know that you know what I mean
So at what point of you knowing
Are you just controlling me
If I'd do anything for you, that means
You know you could do anything to me

You love to watch me dance
Reshaping till you like me again
But the eggshells all break and thin ice always caves
And you just shake your head

You put a picture up
And it didn't feel like love
Just a reminder of contractual debt and luck

And I know that you know what I mean
So at what point of you knowing
Are you just controlling me
If I'd do anything for you, that means
You know you could do anything

Do you know how humiliating it can be
To beg for forgiveness that you shouldn't need
I begged for forgiveness that I didn't need
I begged for forgiveness that I didn't need
I begged for forgiveness that I didn't need
I begged for forgiveness

"Orlando"

Your voice puts sickness into my gut
And I swallowed just a little too much
I don't know what I did wrong
It's not your fault, I just think I was in love

You make every part of me small
I'm short of breath and two feet tall
And I still don't know what I did wrong
It's not your fault, I just think I was in love

What was the day
That you ceased to think of me like that
I don't know what I said
But I'd like the chance to take it back

I have been avoiding you I guess
'Cause when we speak I forget, forget, forget
Then when it hits me, it's further into my chest
You don't want me, forget, forget, forget

Forget, forget, forget

My voice puts sickness into my gut
And I can't believe I missed it once
I guess you did nothing wrong
And I swear it wouldn't have mattered so much

None of this would be worth the fuss if I hadn't been in love
I just think I was in love

"We'll Never Have Sex"

Depollute me, pretty baby
Suck the rot right out of my bloodstream
Oh, dilute me, gentle angel
Water down what I called being grateful

Oh, you kissed me just to kiss me
Not to take me home
It was simple, it was sweetness
It was good to know

You look perfect, you look different
I don't wonder about your indifference
If I said you could never touch me
You'd come over and say I looked lovely

Oh, you kissed me just to kiss me
Not to make me cry
It was simple, you are sweetness
Let's just sit a while

Depollute me, gentle angel
And I'll feel the sickness less and less
Come and kiss me, pretty baby
Like we'll never have sex

"Guts"

I saw you at a party
So I waited in the kitchen for my friends
You wanted to say sorry
But I wanna see your body in a ditch

You held me down and told me
That I thought that you were handsome, but you're wrong
A friend called it a damn shame
'Cause you're really good at playing along

And if I had the guts I would've
Punched you in the backroom
Left you bleeding on the kitchen tiles
While I cleaned up in the bathroom
You thought you were an actor
Claimed a hammered body double
Then you wrote yourself a letter
To my name for all your trouble

I told my friend about you
He was so upset I thought he might've cried
But outside on the pavement
Well it turned to "I like playing with the guy."

And I don't know about my body
It feels like the wrong parts were sent to me
All these feelings I can't name yet
Claimed and touched and played with in my sleep

And if I had the guts I would've
Said "you can't repair it"
Screamed and cried outside the venue
To make sure you were embarrassed
Acted just insane enough
For your friends to claim hysterics
And all the men who couldn't sleep with me
Would testify and swear it

But do their mothers know
Do their mothers know

I know it's not really her fault, but I
I do think that she'd cry if I called
I know it's really not her fault, but I
I do think that she'd cry if I called

And if I had the guts I would've
Punched you in the backroom
If I had the guts I would've
Punched you in the backroom

If I had the guts I would've
Punched you in the backroom
Left you bleeding on the kitchen tiles
While I cleaned up in the bathroom
You thought you were an actor
Claimed a hammered body double
Then you wrote yourself a letter
To my name for all your trouble

But does your mother know
Does your mother know

"Ask First"

Old, you've made me old
Wise beyond how wise I'd want a body
Cold, so young and cold
I lie to yawn, to cross and dot the note

I imitate, I trace your words
To better fake a better sorry
Sorry soul
But sorry, "Friends, they never scold"

We won't joke around
I won't visit when I'm in town
Listen, from here on
Here on out
I don't write about you now

Mend, you made amends
You've made a man
You make up men
Who break a bone to fix a heart
Paint it nice and call it art

While beauty breaks beneath the blues
You sang for you, I sang for you
And now I'm gone
A full day's drive
And I'm seeing you when you're out of sight

We won't joke around
I won't visit when I'm in town
Listen, from here on
Here on out
I don't write about you now

We won't joke around
I won't visit when I'm in town
Listen, from here on
Here on out
I don't write about you now

"Everything Ends"

Everything ends
From tv shows to parties
Everything ends
Every song and every meal

Everything ends
And that's the saddest thing
I think I'll ever hear

But everything ends
Bad dreams and sorrow
Everything ends
The ache that life has lent

Everything ends
And that's the sweetest thing
I'll ever hear again
That everything ends

"(You) On My Arm"

I wish I'd had a chance to walk with you to parties
You would wear a dress, and I would say "I'm sorry"
For something, don't know what it'd be
But you'd say "Nothing, it's nothing"
And smile at me

I wanna sit around and watch you do your hair
Talk it all into the ground and have a ceremony there
For something, don't know what it'd be
But it'd become nothing, it's nothing
And you'd smile at me

I wanna be, I wanna buy you
Pretty little things and never ever lie to you
Watch you get dressed and compliment your taste
I'd be better armed if you agreed to take it

I wish I'd had a chance to take over the driving
You'd swear to keep me up and fall asleep beside me
And nothing, no terrible dream
Could ever wake us
I don't wanna wake up

And then, one good day when we live in the same city
I'll come by and tell you that you look insanely pretty
Like something, don't know what it'd be
But you'd say nothing, like something
And smile at me

I wanna be, I wanna buy you
Pretty little things and never ever lie to you
Watch you get dressed and compliment your taste 'cause
I'd be better armed if you agreed to take it
I'd be better armed if you agreed to take it
I'd be better armed if you agreed

I wish I'd had a chance to walk with you to parties
Where you would wear a dress and I would say I'm sorry
For something

Oh, I wanna be, I wanna buy you
Pretty little things and never ever lie to you
Watch you get dressed and compliment your taste 'cause
I'd be better armed if you agreed to take it
I wanna be, I wanna buy you
Pretty little things and never ever lie to you
Watch you get dressed and compliment your taste, well
I'd be better armed if you agreed to take it

Oh, I'd be better armed if you agreed to take it
I'd be better armed if you agreed

"To Learn"

What can I say
I'm learning to lie
But I'm living to learn
What to lie about

I'm losing again
From holding too tight
But I'm living to lose
What I can do without

I've played a few games
Where no score could be fitting
But I'm learning when winning is
Just not worth the sport

And I've been so ashamed
That I've run like the wind
But I'm learning about giving up
And sparing the horse

When I've been cruel
I've taken up self hatred
Procrastinating pains
Of finally seeing myself

But when I looked on the truth
And it bloomed for all its patience
There was ugliness and shame
But there was
Something else

What can I say
I'm learning to die
But I'm living to learn

"Too Much Time In My House Alone"

At the back of a slingshot
Hoping there's no rot in the wood
Hoping the books I read were good enough for their morals
At the back of a school bus
Knowing I'm late to get home
Not used to being on my own, trying to be normal

But I guess I'm going
Or I'm dying
And I'm finding out

At the end of a bad knot
Hoping there's slack in the rope
Hoping there's somewhere to go through the fog at my feet
Signing off on a letter
As it replaces the wine
Praying it's read just one time and not lost at sea

But I guess I'm going
Or I'm dying
And I'm finding out

I've been looking at myself
And I've been waiting for a reaction
Nothing from the reflection
It's just a kid in circular glasses
Running, running from lightning
Waiting for thunder under her dad's wing
I would, just to be back there
I would do, I would do something

I've been staring at myself
And I've been waiting for an infraction
Something to make me feel better
About being better than I once had been
Running, running from lightning
Waiting inside for something to happen
Missing and never risking rain
For the sake of staying in fashion

"I'd Have To Think About It"

I know that I will love again
I'll meet someone and I'll make amends
I'm sure she'll be a gentleman
And I will be content

I know that I would be fulfilled
See the world and pay my bills
Have a drink and eat my fill
Of dinners and free will

But if you come to me
In my home with my three kids
If you'd asked me to leave
To be with you and split
Well I'd at least have to think about it

You never loved the same amount
You spent a week at my mother's house
And honest, I can tell you now
I'll love you more than my future spouse

And if you come to me
When I've promised to commit
If you told me that you loved me
And asked me for a kiss
Well I'd at least have to think about it

You are my Achille's heel
The weakness only I can feel
I've been a liar and you've been a pill
But I'd still have to think about it

Things just won't be the same
I'm scared to death that I'll scream your name
And still, there's not a thing that I'd change
And that's okay, when I think about it

"Jimmy's Lullaby"

It's getting hard to leave your apartment
The light goes too often and your power is down
It's getting dark and warmth isn't promised
But I'll like you longest when love's not around

I'm gonna come over
And I'm gonna sit there
And I'm gonna hold you
To me when you cry
I'm gonna love better
And I'm gonna listen
And I'm gonna spend winter home by your side

I've spent a life breaking my promises
'Cause the ones that I offered were forced from my hand
I've spent a life practicing caution
And I haven't often changed all my plans

But you just come over
And I'll watch you sit there
And offer to hold me
To you when I cry
I've learned to love better
Since I've seen you listen
And I'm gonna spend winter home by your side

I've spent the year counting my losses
Waiting for slip-ups and scolding my skin
I've spent the year counting my downfalls
Saying I called it and calling it quits

But something is stirring
And something is different
I stood in your kitchen
And I melt down and cry
I think you weep when you find what you're missing
And I'm gonna spend winter home by your side

It's getting hard to leave your apartment
The light goes too often and your power is down
It's getting dark and warmth isn't promised
But I'll love you longest

"Monogamy"

I fall in love
With a different person each week
But I can only do monogamy
Someone tell me what that means

I've been around
But I don't know what I leave behind
Did my lovers all think I was kind
And when I left, did they know I was lying

Would you tell me if I was a player but the mouth of God
Would you tell me if you had to fake it but you loved me honestly

I want people to think
That I am the love of their lives
When I know they aren't the love of mine
And then I call myself cruel to be kind

I haven't browsed
Through kiosks with gold wedding bands
Since hue bending light held my hand
Silent and walking on Bank

Would you tell me if I was a player but the mouth of God
Would you tell me if you had to fake it but you loved me honestly

I fall in love
With a different person each week
But I can only do monogamy
Someone tell me what that means

"music box"

Past the fourth turn by the barn
Where Mrs. Fullman lived 'til she passed on
There is a cottage by the lakeside
Where fairies come out at night

There's a music box in the bedroom
It's playing songs from 1922
And if you listen for long enough
You'll fall asleep and might wake up

Walking in a wonderland
Played in by a marching band
Reaching for a peach
From a shiny purple tree

A butterfly the size of you
Offers to go flying with you
Climb on to her back
And doze off as you relax

Past the light post by the sea
There is a forest with no trees
And there is a garden by the wayside
Where flowers grow over night

There's a music box in the bay
Down on the seabed not so far away
And if you lean in just close enough
You'll be taken by the water and might wake up

Walking in a wonderland
Played in by the singing sand
Waking from a dream
On an underwater beach

A manta ray the brightest blue
Offers to go flying with you
Lay down on her back
And doze off as you relax

Oh the places in your dreams
Are they fiction, or memory
If you listen for long enough
You'll fall asleep

"Smoke Signals"

I went with you up to
The place you grew up in
We spent a week in the cold
Just long enough to
"Walden" it with you
Any longer, it would have got old
Singing "Ace of Spades" when Lemmy died
But nothing's changed, L.A.'s all right
Sleeping in my bed again, and getting in my head
And then walk around the reservoir

You, you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach

One of your eyes is
Always half-shut
Something happened when you were a kid
I didn't know you then
And I'll never understand
Why it feels like I did
"How Soon Is Now" in an '80s sedan
You slept inside of it because your dad
Lived in a campground in the back of a van
You said that song will creep you out until you're dead

And you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach

I want to live at
The Holiday Inn
Where somebody else makes the bed
We'll watch TV while
The lights on the street
Put all the stars to death
It's been on my mind since Bowie died
Just checking out to hide from life
And all of our problems, I'm gonna solve 'em
With you riding shot-gun, speeding, 'cause fuck the cops

And you, you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach

I buried a hatchet
It's coming up lavender
The future's unwritten
The past is a corridor
I'm at the exit looking back through the hall
You are anonymous
I am a concrete wall

"Motion Sickness"

I hate you for what you did
And I miss you like a little kid
I faked it every time but that's alright
I can hardly feel anything
I hardly feel anything at all

You gave me fifteen hundred
To see your hypnotherapist
I only went one time, you let it slide
Fell on hard times a year ago
Was hoping you would let it go and you did

I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out

I'm on the outside looking through
You're throwing rocks around your room
And while you're bleeding on your back in the glass
I'll be glad that I made it out
And sorry that it all went down like it did

I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out

And why do you sing with an English accent
I guess it's too late to change it now
You know I'm never gonna let you have it
But I will try to drown you out

You said when you met me you were bored
You said when you met me you were bored
And you you were in a band when I was born

I have emotional motion sickness
I try to stay clean and live without
And I want to know what would happen
If I surrender to the sound
Surrender to the sound

"Funeral"

I'm singing at a funeral tomorrow
For a kid a year older than me
And I've been talking to his dad, it makes me so sad
When I think too much about it I can't breathe

And I have this dream where I'm screaming underwater
While my friends are all waving from the shore
And I don't need you to tell me what that means
I don't believe in that stuff anymore

Jesus Christ, I'm so blue all the time
And that's just how I feel
Always have and I always will
I always have and always will

I have a friend I call
When I've bored myself to tears
And we talk until we think we might just kill ourselves
But then we laugh until it disappears

And last night I blacked out in my car
And I woke up in my childhood bed
Wishing I was someone else, feeling sorry for myself
When I remembered someone's kid is dead

Jesus Christ, I'm so blue all the time
And that's just how I feel
Always have and I always will
I always have and always will

And it's 4 AM, again
And I'm doing nothing
Again

"Demi Moore"

Take a dirty picture, babe
I can't sleep and I miss your face
In my hands and in my knees
Tell me what you wanna do to me
Tell me what you'll do, please

I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone anymore

You got quiet on the other line
Said the sun was coming up
And I laughed until I couldn't breathe
Now I'm too tired to go to sleep
Now I can't breathe, and I can't sleep

I don't wanna be stoned
I don't wanna be stoned anymore

Don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna be alone anymore

I could feel alone
I could, I got a good feeling
It doesn't happen very often

"Scott Street"

Walking Scott Street, feeling like a stranger
With an open heart, open container
I've got a stack of mail and a tall can
It's a shower beer it's a payment plan

There's helicopters over my head
Every night when I go to bed
Spending money and I earned it
When I'm lonely, that's when I'll burn it

Do you feel ashamed
When you hear my name

I asked you "How is your sister
I heard she got her degree"
And I said, "That makes me feel old"
He said, "What does that make me"

I asked you "How is playing drums"
You said it's too much shit to carry
"And what about the band"
You said they're all getting married

Do you feel ashamed
When you hear my name

Anyway, don't be a stranger
Anyway, don't be a stranger
Don't be a stranger

"Killer"

Sometimes I think I'm a killer
Scared you in your house
Even scared myself by talking
About Dahmer on your couch

But I can't sleep next to a body
Even harmless in death
Plus I'm pretty sure I'd miss you
And faking sleep to count your breath

Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you
Is there nothing left to do for us
I am sick of the chase
But I'm hungry for blood
And there's nothing I can do

But when I'm sick and tired
When my mind is barely there
When a machine keeps me alive
And I'm losing all my hair

I hope you kiss my rotten head
And pull the plug
Know that I've burned every playlist
And given all my love

Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you
I know there's something waiting for us
I am sick of the chase
But I'm stupid in love
And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can do

"Georgia"

Georgia, Georgia I love your son
When he gets older, he might be the one
He might be the one
Georgia, Georgia he has beautiful bones
And he never lies or picks up his phone

Sometimes in the pouring rain
He'll fall in the mud and get back up again
And if you find me
Will you know me
Will you take me
Or will you fall

Here is my day plan, my new machine
He is a fine new addition, so young and so clean
So young and so clean
He came up through the water without a sound
With my back to the shoreline, I dreamt that he drowned
I dreamt that he drowned

Sometimes when he looks at me
I know that he needs you, you're all that he sees
And if I had breathed you
Will it kill me
Will you have me
Or watch me fall
If I had fixed you
Will you hate me
Would you fuck this
And let us fall

"Chelsea"

For a chemical imbalance, you sure know how to ride a train
Your revolution is a deathbed, and the music is your maid
When someone comes a knocking with a needle on a tray
Only your lonesome lies beside you
For you told me not to stay
You are somebody's baby, some mother held you near
No it's not important, they're just pretty words, my dear
There is no distraction that can make me disappear
No there's nothing that won't remind you
I will always be right here

And you spit the blood back, spit the blood back
Baby, I'm amazed that you're alright
Oh, so long prison boy, I won't be home with you tonight

We're both very sick, our muscles all worn down
It's as if we are one-hundredno, I won't still be around
Because I've fallen, yes I've fallen right into the love I found
Long before I reach one-hundred
I'll have fallen to the ground
And for generations
Their romances make us more
It's much less than than ever was before, the Chelsea and the floor
Make us stand before the masses like two speakers for the poor
When there was no revolution
Nothing we were fighting for

And you spit the blood back, spit the blood back
Baby, I'm amazed that you're alright
Oh, so long prison boy, I won't be home
I won't be home
I won't be home with you tonight

And you can call the service bell
When we stay at the Chelsea hotel
And I'll stay out of my own head

Oh, so long prison boy, I won't be home
I won't be home
I won't be home with you tonight

"Would You Rather"

Playing would you rather
When it comes to fire
You always say that you'd prefer to drown
You were still in the ambulance
When the cop suggested
You're the one who tried to burn it down

Come to find out
I'm a can on a string, you're on the end
We find our way out
Of a suicide pact of our family and friends
In the background I'll be waiting

We have the same face
I laid awake
As someone shoved you up against a wall
Quarantined in a bad dream
He's half the man
And you're twice as tall

Come to find out
I'm a can on a string, you're on the end
We find our way out
Of a suicide pact of our family and friends
In the background I'll be waiting

Next time I see you you'll show me
A hundred different ways to say the same things

Come to find out
I'm a can on a string, you're on the end
We find our way out
Of a suicide pact of our family and friends
And when you touch down I'll be waving

"You Missed My Heart"

Broke into her house, saw her sitting there
Drinking coke and whiskey in her bra and underwear
Saw him in the kitchen, hanging up the phone
I asked him nicely once to pack his things and go

He gave her a reassuring look, said he wouldn't leave
But I asked him one more time, this time pulled out my shiv
Struck him in the back and I pulled it out slow
And I watched him fall down, and as the morning sun rose
He looked at me and said

"You missed my heart, you missed my heart
You got me good, I knew you would
But you missed my heart, you missed my heart"
Were his last words before he died

Looking out the window, up at the blue sky
Listening to her scream, listening to her cry
A feeling of relief came over my soul
I couldn't take it any longer and I lost control

I chased her up the stairs and I pinned her to the ground
And underneath her whimpering I could hear the sirens sound
I rattled off a list of all the things I missed
Like going to the movies with her and the way she kissed me

Driving into downtown Wheeling, showing her off
Backyard barbecues and reunions in the park
I said I missed her skin and when started laughing
And while I clenched down on her wrist, she said "that's quite a list
But there's one thing you missed

"You missed my heart, you missed my heart
That's quite a list, but what you really missed
You missed my heart, you missed my heart
That's quite a list, but what you really missed"

Running through the parking lot, running through the fields
Policemen on my back, something hit my skull and cracked
They dragged me off to jail, set a million dollar bail
Where I tried to tie a noose, but I failed and I broke loose

I went racing through the prison yard, shot down by a tower guard
He got me in the shins, and he got me in the arms
They strapped me in the gurney, took me off to the infirmary
Where the priest read my last rites
And just before, everything went dark

I said "He missed my heart, he missed my heart
He got me good, I knew he would
But he missed my heart, he missed my heart"
And just before, everything went dark

The most poetic dream came flowing like the sea
Laying there my lifeblood draining out of me
A childhood scene then, sky moon beams
Fishing with my friends sitting in the wild reeds

Watching the Ohio river flow at night
Waiting for the bullhead catfishes to bite
Downriver from the Moundsville prison graveyard...

"It'll All Work Out"

She wore faded jeans and soft black leather
She had eyes so blue they looked like weather
When she needed me I wasn't around
That's the way it goes, it'll all work out

There were times apart and times together
I was pledged to her for worse or better
When it mattered most I let her down
That's the way it goes, it'll all work out

It'll all work out eventually
Better off with him than here with me

Now the wind is high and the rain is heavy
The water's rising in the levee
Still I think of her when the sun goes down
Never goes away, but it all works out
Never goes away, but it all works out

"Garden Song"

Someday I'm gonna live
In your house up on the hill
And when your skinhead neighbor goes missing
I'll plant a garden in the yard then
They're gluing roses on a flatbed
You should see it, I mean thousands
I grew up here till it all went up in flames
Except the notches in the doorframe

I don't know when you got taller
See our reflection in the water
Off a bridge at the Huntington
I hopped the fence when I was seventeen
Then I knew what I wanted

And when I grow up, I'm gonna look up
From my phone and see my life
And it's gonna be just like my recurring dream
I'm at the movies
I don't remember what I'm seeing
The screen turns into a tidal wave
Then it's a dorm room, like a hedge maze
And when I find you
You touch my leg and I insist
But I wake up before we do it

I don't know how, but I'm taller
It must be something in the water
Everything's growing in our garden
You don't have to know that it's haunted
The doctor put her hands over my liver
She told me my resentment's getting smaller
No, I'm not afraid of hard work
I get everything I want
I have everything I wanted

"Kyoto"

Day off in Kyoto, got bored at the temple
Looked around at the 7-11
The band took the speed train, went to the arcade
I wanted to go but I didn't
You called me from a payphone, they still got pay phones
It costs a dollar a minute
To tell me you're getting sober and you wrote me a letter
But I don't have to read it

I'm gonna kill you
If you don't beat me to it
Dreaming through Tokyo skies
I wanted to see the world
Then I flew over the ocean
And I changed my mind

Sunset's been a freak show
On the weekend so I've been driving out to the suburbs
To park at the Goodwill and stare at the chem trails
With my little brother
He said you called on his birthday
You were off by like ten days
But you get a few points for trying
Remember getting the truck fixed when you let us drive it
25 felt like flying

I don't forgive you
But please don't hold me to it
Born under Scorpio skies
I wanted to see the world
Through your eyes until it happened
Then I changed my mind

Guess I lied
I'm a liar
Who lies
'Cause I'm a liar

"Punisher"

When the speed kicks in
I go to the store for nothing
And walk right by
The house where you lived with Snow White
I wonder if she ever thought
The storybook tiles on the roof were too much
But from the window, it's not a bad show
If your favorite thing's Dianetics or stucco

The drugstores are open all night
The only real reason I moved to the east side
I love a good place to hide in plain sight

What if I told you
I feel like I know you
But we never met

And here, everyone knows you're the way to my heart
Hear so many stories of you at the bar
Most times, alone, and some, looking your worst
But never not sweet to the trust funds and punishers

Man, I wish that I could say the same
I swear I'm not angry, that's just my face
A copycat killer with a chemical cut
Either I'm careless or I wanna get caught
Who I'm not

What if I told you
I feel like I know you
But we never met
It's for the best

I can't open my mouth and forget how to talk
'Cause even if I could
Wouldn't know where to start
Wouldn't know when to stop

"Halloween"

I hate living by the hospital
The sirens go all night
I used to joke that if they woke you up
Somebody better be dying
Sick of the questions I keep asking you
They make you live in the past
But I can count on you to tell me the truth
When you've been drinking and you're wearing a mask

Baby, it's Halloween
We can be anything
Come on, man
We can be anything

Always surprised what I'd do for love
Some things I'd never expect
They killed a fan down by the stadium
Was only visiting, they beat him to death

Baby, it's Halloween
We can be anything
Come on, man
We can be anything

Baby, it's Halloween
There's a last time for everything
Come on, man
We can be anything

Whatever you want
I'll be whatever you want
Whatever you want
Be whatever you want
I'll be whatever you want
(Whatever you want)
I'll be whatever you want
(Whatever you want)
(Whatever you want)

"Chinese Satellite"

I've been running around in circles
Pretending to be myself
Why would somebody do this on purpose
When they could do something else
Drowning out the morning birds
With the same three songs over and over
I wish I wrote it, but I didn't so I learn the words
Hum along 'til the feeling's gone forever

Took a tour to see the stars
But they weren't out tonight
So I wished hard on a Chinese satellite
I want to believe
Instead I look at the sky and I feel nothing
You know I hate to be alone
I want to be wrong

You were screamin' at the Evangelicals
They were screamin' right back from what I remember
When you said I will never be your vegetable
Because I think when you're gone it's forever
But you know I'd stand on the corner
Embarrassed with a picket sign
If it meant I would see you
When I die

Sometimes when I can't sleep
It's just a matter of time before I'm hearing things
Swore I could feel you through the walls
But that's impossible
I want to believe
That if I go outside I'll see a tractor beam
Coming to take me to where I'm from
I want to go home

"Moon Song"

You asked to walk me home
But I had to carry you
And you pushed me in
Now my feet can't touch the bottom of you

You couldn't have, you couldn't have
Stuck your tongue down the throat of somebody
Who loves you more
I will wait for the next time you want me
Like a dog with a bird at your door

We hate Tears in Heaven
But it's sad his baby died
We fought about John Lennon
Until I cried
Then I went to bed upset

Now I'm dreaming
And you're singing at my birthday
I've never seen you smiling so big
It's nautical themed
And there's something I'm supposed to say
Can't for the life of me remember what it is

And if I could give you the moon
I would give you the moon

You are sick, and you're married
And you might be dying
But you're holding me like water in your hands
When you saw the dead little bird, you started crying
But you know the killer doesn't understand

"Savior Complex"

Emotional affair
Overly sincere
Smoking in the car, windows up
Crocodile tears, run the tap 'til it's clear
Drift off on the floor
I drag you to the shore
Sweating through the sheets
You're gonna drown in your sleep for sure

Wake up and start a big fire
In our one room apartment
But I'm too tired
To have a pissing contest
All the bad dreams that you hide
Show me yours, I'll show you mine

Call me when you land
I'll drive around again
One hand on the wheel, one in your mouth
Turn me on and turn me down

Baby, you're a vampire
You want blood and I promised
I'm a bad liar
With a savior complex
All the skeletons you hide
Show me yours and I'll show you mine

All the bad dreams that you hide
Show me yours

"I See You"
(ICU)

Laying down on the lawn
I'm tired of trying to get in the house
I'm thinking out loud
I've been playing dead
My whole life
And I get this feeling whenever I feel good
It'll be the last time

But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you

If you're a work of art
I'm standing too close
I can see the brush strokes
I hate your mom
I hate it when she opens her mouth
It's amazing to me how much you can say
When you don't know what you're talking about

But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you

I used to light you up
Now I can't even get you to play the drums
'Cause I don't know what I want
Until I fuck it up

But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something

I'll climb through the window again
But right now it feels good not to stand
Then I'll leave it wide open
Let the dystopian morning light pour in

"Graceland Too"

No longer a danger to herself or others
She made up her mind and laced up her shoes
Yelled down the hall but nobody answered
So she walked outside without an excuse

She could do anything she wants to
She could do whatever she wants to do
She could go home, but she's not going to

So she picks a direction, it's ninety in Memphis
Turns up the music so thoughts don't intrude
Predictably winds up thinking of Elvis
And wonders if he believed songs could come true

I'm asking for it if they do
Doesn't know what she wants
Or what she's gonna do
A rebel without a clue

So we spent what was left of our serotonin
To chew on our cheeks and stare at the moon
Said she knows she'll live through it to get to this moment
Ate a sleeve of saltines on my floor and I knew that

I would do anything you want me to
I would do anything for you
I would do anything
I would do anything
Whatever you want me to do, I will do

Whatever she wants
Whatever she wants
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
I would do anything (Whatever you want)
I would do anything (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)

"I Know The End"

Somewhere in Germany, but I can't place it
Man, I hate this part of Texas
Close my eyes, fantasize
Three clicks and I'm home
When I get back, I'll lay around
Then I'll get up and lay back down
Romanticize a quiet life
There's no place like my room

But you had to go, I know, I know, I know
Like a wave that crashed and melted on the shore
Not even the burnouts are out here anymore
And you had to go, I know, I know, I know

Out in the park, we watch the sunset
Talkin' on a rusty swing set
After a while, you went quiet
And I got mean
I'm always pushin' you away from me
But you come back with gravity
And when I call, you come home
A bird in your teeth

So, I gotta go, I know, I know, I know
When the sirens sound, you'll hide under the floor
But I'm not gonna go down with my hometown in a tornado
I'm gonna chase it, I know, I know, I know
I gotta go now, I know, I know, I know

Drivin' out into the sun
Let the ultraviolet cover me up
Went looking for a creation myth
Ended up with a pair of cracked lips
Windows down, scream along
To some America First rap-country song
A slaughterhouse, an outlet mall
Slot machines, fear of God
Windows down, heater on
Big bolt of lightning hanging low
Over the coast, everyone's convinced
It's a government drone or an alien spaceship
Either way, we're not alone
I'll find a new place to be from
A haunted house with a picket fence
To float around and ghost my friends
No, I'm not afraid to disappear
The billboard said "The End Is Near"
I turned around, there was nothing there
Yeah, I guess the end is here

The end is here
The end is here
The end is here
The end is

"If We Make It Through December"

If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be all right, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine

Got laid off at the factory
And their timing is not the greatest in the world
Heaven knows I've been working hard
Wanted Christmas to be right for my girl
I don't mean to hate December
It's meant to be the happy time of year
And my little girl don't understand
Why we can't afford no Christmas gear

If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be all right, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine

"7 O'Clock News  Silent Night"

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

"Christmas Song"

Comin' back from the country
For the good food and lousy beer
This winter's so dry and the dirt road so dusty
At the lightest fall of rain, the bacteria bloom

You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it

Tethered to a table with that happy holiday crowd
And it's anchors aweigh
Looks like smooth sailin'
But the merest hint of waves could capsize you

You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it

The desire for annihilation
Is as common as it is unkind
And it's hard to recognize the situation
When you're desperately tryin' to have a good time

You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it

Yeah, it's Christmas
So no one can fix it

"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Next year all our troubles will be miles away

Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us, once more

Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now

"Coming Down"

I miss the drip in the back of my throat
Sometimes I miss my bloody nose
Two heads underwater, together we drowned
But nothing feels better when you're coming down
Nothing feels better when you're coming down

There's nothing that I won't believe
Waves are crashing over me
When a beautiful voice makes an awful sound
Well, nothing feels worse when you're coming down
Nothing feels worse when you're coming down

He said, "I need air, I need space"
One of us will die in this place
I see the fire through these clouds
I'll never have to feel it if I never come down
Never have to feel it if I never come down
Never have to feel it if I never come down

No mirrors on the table
No cab to the Chelsea Hotel
When it's freezing cold and I'm not able to tell

I see the rooftops disappear
How did I end up down here
Am I falling asleep or blacking out
Need you here if I ever come down
Need you here if I ever come down

It's the first time in months I've slept a whole night
You never once left my bedside
But don't you worry about me now
Just hold my hand and lay me down
Hold my hand and lay me down
Hold my hand and lay me down
Nothing feels better when you're coming down

"Sidelines"

I'm not afraid of anything at all
Not dying in a fire, not being broke again
I'm not afraid of living on a fault line
'Cause nothing ever shakes me, nothing makes me cry

Not a plane going down
In the ocean and drowning

Watched the world from the sidelines
Had nothing to prove
Till you came into my life
Gave me something to lose
Now I know what it feels like
To want to go outside
Like the shape of my outline

I'm not afraid of going back to school
I gave it up the first time, but I'll try again
I'm not afraid of getting older
Used to fetishize myself
Now I'm talking to my house plants

Not of being alone
In a room full of people

Watching the world from the sidelines
Had nothing to prove
Till you came into my life
Gave me something to lose
Now I know what it feels like
To want to go outside
Like the shape of my outline

And I used to think
You could hear the ocean in a seashell
What a childish thing

"Waiting Room"

If you were a teacher, I would fail your class
Take it over and over til you noticed me
If you were a waiting room, I would never see a doctor
I would sit there with my first aid kit and bleed

I want to be the power ballad that lifts you up and hold you down
I wanna be the broken love song that feeds your misery
And I can wish all I want, but it won't bring us together
Plus I know whatever happens to me
I know it's for the better

When broken bodies are washed ashore
Who am I to ask for more, more, more
But you're breathing in my open mouth
You're the gun in my lips that will blow my brains out

I want to make you drive all night just because I said maybe you should come over
I want to make you fall in love as hard as my poor parents teenage daughter
She'll be the best you ever had if you let her

I know it's for the better...

"Whatever"

It's that teenage feeling, got me staying in bed
There is nothing on my mind but water in my head
It's got me falling for just anyone, at least thinking I did
And it leaves me hanging on like some idiot kid

But I knew I had it coming
Well I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming

Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da dum

It's that teenage sickness keeping me up all night
It's got me climbing up the walls just to pick a good fight
I don't want to be so desperate, oh what have I done
Oh but I can't be alone, I'll take anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone

This was a test, this was a test
This was a test, this was a test
This was a test, this was a test yeah baby
This, this was a test yeah baby
This, this was a test yeah baby

Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da dum

I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming

Whoa this was a test, this was a test
This was a test, this was a test
This was a test

"Wilt"

I've got a surgeon's precision and a drunk man's hand
They say I've stopped growin', so I do what I can
Nothin' ever changes but the cigarette brand
But don't panic, it's just routine
Don't panic, this is just routine

You've got roses on the brain, and I'm all wilt
You've got snowflakes in your veins, and I'm all melt
You don't got blame on your breath
God bless, but all I taste is guilt
Ooh

Misery will bury you
I'm so sorry if I'm scarin' you
What was I supposed to do
As opposed to lovin' you

I've got a surgeon's hand and a drunk man's passion
Totally limbless and I'm ready for action
Nothin' ever changes but the taste of tobacco
But don't panic, it's just routine
Don't panic, this is just routine

You've got roses on the brain, and I'm all wilt
You've got snowflakes in your veins, and I'm all melt
You don't got blame on your breath
God bless, but all I taste is guilt
Ooh

Misery will bury you
I'm so sorry if I'm scarin' you
What was I supposed to do
As opposed to lovin' you

You've got roses the brain, and I'm all wilt

But misery will bury you
I'm so sorry if I'm scarin' you
What was I supposed to do
As opposed to lovin' you

"Turned Around"

I'm not crazy
I'm just nervous
I'm on my toes
At the edge of the world
And my mind feels like an empty room
The inside black as coal
And it hurts to want something so bad
That you lose all self control

And I know
How you are sometimes
And I know
You're just a little turned around

Yeah, I can feel it getting late
And my body is getting tired
But there's no point leaving before they game
When my mind feels so wired
Yeah, you took me to this station and you showed me every sign
No one else could understand
You know I'm lost but I'll be fine

And you know
How I am sometimes
And you know
I'm just a little turned around

We had it all planned out
It's so hard to watch it burn
Burn...
Watch it burn

Watch it burn

"Steamroller"

I am tired of being sad
I feel it when I wake up
And it just stays bad
It hits me like a sickness
Or a steamroller
Makes me wanna lay down
And get run over

But then I see you
Always smiling
Makes me wanna touch you
Keep from dying

You're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
You're the feeling I get
When I'm feeling fine

Part of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won't fall unless you ask me to

We talk for hours
Until finally
Sleep takes over
The amphetamines

In the darkness
I feel your fingers
They don't touch me
But there's a danger

You're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
Your the feeling I get
When I'm feeling fine

Part of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won't fall unless you ask me

You're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
You're the feeling I get
When I'm feeling fine

Part of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won't fall unless you ask me"Same Girl"

I'm still wearing my blue jeans
No I don't know what you mean
I'm still the same girl
Picking daisies in the field
I believe in what I feel
I've always been the same girl

Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun

I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl

I still live in one small town
But always love to move around
I've always been the same girl
Still keep diaries that say
Where I was and did that day
I've always been the same girl

Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun

I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl

Some days will change your life
Yeah this could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking...

I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl

Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl

"Baby Blue"

Small town, big blue sky
Little blonde baby with starry blue eyes
Growing up fast didn't slow her down
American child in her baby blue gown
Her bedroom was pink 'til she turned three
She liked the feel of her baby blue sheets
Neighbors stared at the one horse lie
Of a little girl with blue on her mind

Thought of green when she was feeling blue
American child in her baby blue boots
She was an archangel, sweet danger
Living and loving and singing her song
Knew what she wanted and knew what she loved
And she loved, she loved baby blue

Eighteen, small scene
Here, our love was a beauty unseen
Living life young, she'd never get bored
When Hank came around in his beat-up Ford
Prom night came with a blue corsage
Had the car waxed at Ben's Garage
Told her he loved her and meant nothing less
To a baby-blonde girl in a baby blue dress
He reached over and kissed her hand
Five years later came a brand-new, baby blue wedding band

She was a romantic, taking chances
Living and loving and singing her song
Knew what she wanted and knew what she loved
And she loved, she loved baby blue

Married two years, Hank was an engineer
She would just stay home, soon-to-be mom
Every night they'd sit on the front porch
Waiting for the brand-new, brand-new baby to come

She was a newcomer, lullaby hummer
Counting her blessings and living for love
Knew what she wanted and knew what she loved
And she loved her new baby, Blue
Her brand-new baby, Blue
Her newborn baby, Blue

Small town, big blue sky
Little blonde baby with starry blue eyes

"Never Fade"

I think you fell off of your cloud today
You didn't see it coming or did you
You tried to please everybody
But the sweet breeze swept you away

The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think you're all alone in this place
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby

Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade

Hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you
Somebody blows your candle out
You wore a mask, now that's broken too
Everybody else was everything to you

The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think everybody wants a fight
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby

Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade

I think you fell out of the sky today
I think you know it's true
You've seen the world, now all you see is me
Tell me now baby what are you gonna do

Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Never fade

"Fire"

Asking you questions is like asking for lies
"Won't happen no more," yeah, I've heard that before
Running 'round in circles isn't my game
I tried to make it work but I end up getting burned

By the fire
Leading on life with a tear in my eye
And I know
Oh, I should've learned, but I guess it's my turn
To try to put out your fire

Giving you answers to my trivial heart
It's hard to break the chains
That I can't pull apart
Running 'round in circles ain't nobody's game
I tried to make it work but I keep on getting hurt

By the fire
Leading on life with a tear in my eye
And I know
Oh, I should've learned, but I guess it's my turn
To try to put out your fire

Your flames, oh they're putting me out
The smoke, can't see my way out
The heat, the heartaches
The fog, the blindness
The eyes of cries and shattered lies

Trying to put out your fire
Leading on life with a tear in my eye
And I know
Oh, I should've learned, but I guess it's my turn
To try to put out your fire

Oh, I should've learned, but I guess it's my turn
To try to put out your fire

"Mary Jo"

There's a little green house off a gravel road
'Bout a mile from Bobby Freeman's farm
Mary Jo runs her own little flower shop
Courtesy of the old red barn
My mama's mama's lifelong friend, Jo
Didn't like the people of town
Four kids and wildflowers and calla lilies
Jo'd rather have them around

Got me a letter, said
"You gotta come home
I'm feeling a little bit low
It's lilac season and I need some help
Keeping my garden grown
Signed, Mary Jo"

So many questions answered
When I spent that summer with Jo
Lavender pillows and weeping willows
Things I would never have known
'Til Mary Jo

We collected bouquets and made lemonade
Mixed rose water perfume
Jo started giving and I started living
Under the pale blue moon
Sang to Jo's records and Sweet Home Kentucky
Watching her garden grow
Says I'm smart and always was lucky
Now I'll never really know
O, Mary Jo

So many questions answered
When I spent that summer with Jo
Lavender pillows and weeping willows
Things I would never have known
'Til Mary Jo

Summer started packing its bags
And Mary Jo had something on her mind
Cleared her throat and swallowed real hard
And said "My voice seems to be in a bind
But when I wrote that letter I was really sick
The doctor said I was gonna go
Then you came home and it seems to be gone
You made something in that garden grow
But we'll never know"
Said Mary Jo

So many questions answered
When I spent that summer with Jo
Lavender pillows and weeping willows
Things I would never have known
'Til Mary Jo

"My Turn To Be Me"

Something about me didn't fit into your perfect world
I bet the bluegrass stained your smile
You should use a darker color when you write on the wall
I haven't read it a thousand times

Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

You liked the face but you had to replace me
Inside I saw the walls of me go down
You can take the girl away from
Cowboy hats and steel guitars
She'll still sing the same old songs

Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

Turned on that radio
Hey that's when I realized
It wasn't our song, it was yours
And in conversation baby I was decoration
Now I deserve a little bit more than

To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

It's my turn to be me

"Kid In The Crowd"
(unreleased)

Little girl, she looks around
She's standing in the open ground
Looks up at the girl alone
Singing through the microphone
Girl gives girl a little smile
And just one wink that could have run a mile
But life is full of empty days
But the little girl said, "I'm gonna be like that someday"

I remember the eyes
Of the kid in the crowd who cut me down to size
And realizing is crying out loud
For every kid on stage, there is a kid in the crowd

Girl on stage holds her hand
Backed up by a country band
Looking down with eyes of grace
Looked upon that young girl's face
And when she smiled at that 8 year old
Endless thoughts that can never be told
Wiped away those empty days
And the little girl said, "I'm gonna be like that someday"

I remember the eyes
Of the kid in the crowd who cut me down to size
And realizing is crying out loud
For every kid on stage, there is a kid in the crowd

Answered why's are like moonlit skies
And loving eyes are like fireflies
One of these, they really can be
But that little girl, that little girl was me

I remember the time
I was a kid in the crowd
With a dream in my eyes
Realizing is crying out loud
There was a kid on stage, I was a kid in the crowd

I'm still the kid in the crowd

"I Used To Fly"

I... I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the sky
I wanna tell you why
But somehow I know I
Would break down and cry

I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

You... you know I would die
Before I let them see me
See me cry
Please don't leave tonight
Oh let me down slowly
Show me a light

I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

Oh let me think I'm strong
Please don't bring me down
I need you tonight

I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

I... I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the sky

"Lucky You"

There's a little girl in this little town
With a little too much heart to go around.
"Live forever. Never say never.
You can do better," that's what she says.

Her mama named her Lucky on a starlit night.
A rabbit foot in her pocket. She dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different,
And yet she's the same.
And she says, "Do do do..."
Lucky you, lucky you

She sings her little song. She walks along
A little pathway headed for the skies.
Left to travels, lives they unravel.
"Mind over matter," that's what she says.

Her mama named her Lucky on a starlit night.
A rabbit foot in her pocket. She dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different,
And yet she's the same.
And she says, "Do do do..."
Lucky you, lucky you, lucky you.

Maybe she'll sing you "Do do do do."
Maybe she'll bring you up to the skies.
Honey, she'll love you. Funny how some view
Angels above you ain't so far away.

Her mama named her Lucky on a starlit night.
A rabbit foot in her pocket. She dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different,
And yet she's the same.
And she says, "Do do do..."
Lucky you, lucky you.

"Point Of View"

Time is passing slowly for the eight-year-old next door
But mama's watch is ticking off the wall
Jillian and Bobby think that they're a perfect pair
The girls could say he's just a bit too tall

You don't have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say, "I love you"
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view

He hated pink, so she threw out her favorite clothes
His NFL was turned to TLC
Baby's got an attitude and thinks they just don't know
But they all do and wish that she could see

You don't have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say, "I love you"
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view

In the least, a masterpiece
Depends on one's opinion
Worst of all, they never call
But don't think that they weren't wishing

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say, "I love you"
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view
It's all in your point of view
Point of view
It's all in your point of view

"Why Do You Tell Me"

I tried to impress you
It didn't matter to you, I don't matter to you
But you tried to make me think I was crazy
"Put all these dreams on hold," that's what I was being told

Tugging at my heartstrings
Every little part sings, "Ooh, you're gonna bring me down"
But I don't need to know what you don't need to show
Well, I don't wanna go down

So why do you tell me you believe in heaven
Then you get me where it hurts just when I turned around
And I try to fight this hole inside, it's tearing me to pieces
Why do you tell me you believe in me
You believe in me

It hurts so bad to hear you say it
Did I really go so wrong Tell me now, what's going on
Hearts fall like a broken angel
Did you mean to break me down every time I turn around

Tugging at my heartstrings
Every little part sings, "Ooh, you're gonna bring me down"
But I don't need to know what you don't need to show
Well, I don't wanna go down

So why do you tell me you believe in heaven
Then you get me where it hurts just when I turned around
And I try to fight this hole inside, it's tearing me to pieces
Why do you tell me you believe in me
You believe in me

Why do you tell me you believe in heaven
Then you get me where it hurts just when I turned around
And I try to fight this hole inside, it's tearing me to pieces
Why do you tell me you believe in me
You believe in me

"Houston Rodeo"

Shooting star flew across the sky
A light turned on in the barn
Nine-year-old boy and a stream of joy
Just sitting there trying to keep warm
A soon-to-be-mama quarter horse
Looked up at the sky
Then came a foal and he set a goal
Then tears came to his eyes

Little boys, they dream big dreams
And some just might come true
And if he rides, that young foal's strides
Are bound to take him to...
He's going to the Houston rodeo
Ooh, on that horse you ride
Put on his daddy's cowboy hat
With a little Texas town pride
Houston rodeo

Every night, that boy would ride on that horse in moonlight
Black and white, he was a bumpy ride
But that boy was gonna make him right
Through heat and snow, they rode and rode
Soon they were best friends
By light of dawn, they were always gone
Following trails that never end

Little boys, they dream big dreams
And some, they have to come true
If he rides that yearling's strides
Are bound to take him to...
He's going to the Houston rodeo
Ooh, on that horse he'll ride
Put on his daddy's cowboy hat
With a little Texas town pride
Houston rodeo

And when he was a teen
Made it to the rodeo
And as the gate released
He took on the Houston rodeo

He's going to the Houston rodeo
Ooh, on that horse he'll ride
Put on his daddy's cowboy hat
With a little Texas town pride
Oh, that boy, he's gonna ride
Houston rodeo, oh

"A Little More Like You"

Think of something you can't touch
I see angels start to blush when they look at you
When I went to my guitar to write this song I fell apart
'Cause I'm counting every second like time in a jar
And these words are just words, that's not what you are

Would you rather me say what I really mean
I love you but it won't get through if I try too hard
Honestly, what I really mean
Is I want to be a little more like you

Drag a pen across a page
Take a look at what you made- you made me, me
Turn around and watch me live
Learn again that to forgive is to believe
And to thank is to bless
I'm drawing the curtain, 'cause now I've been blessed

Would you rather me say what I really mean
I love you but it won't get through if I try too hard
Honestly, what I really mean
Is I want to be a little more like you
Yeah, I want to be a little more like you

There seems to be something I can't see
That keeps you from falling apart
It's safe to say you're far away
And anybody else, oh anybody else

Would you rather me say what I really mean
I love you but it won't get through if I try too hard
Honestly, what I really mean
Is I want to be a little more like you
Yeah, I want to be a little more like you, like you
Yeah, I want to be a little more like you

"One-Sided Goodbye"

You said it, then you walked away
But you don't know what goodbye means
Baby, I'm sorry, didn't ever mean to hurt you
Please, save it for a rainy day
'Cause you don't know what crying's like
When the world keeps spinning and I can't take it alone

And you're so different from all those other people
I thought it would be different with you
But I can't see you crying without me
So I guess I'll have to make it through without you

I wasn't ready for your one-sided goodbye
You walked around like you loved me, I
Notice how the world tries to mask that word
"See you later," "gotta go," oh no

I don't care what they would say
If you love someone don't let them go
Do you believe in taking chances
So tell me why you walked away
'Cause I can't see through your heart
Everything's hazy and you're making me crazy for you

Well, I thought you were different
Maybe I'm crazy
I know I wasn't numb with you
But I can't hear you crying without me
So I guess I'll have to make it through without you

I wasn't ready for your one-sided goodbye
You walked around like you loved me, I
Notice how the world tries to mask that word
"See you later," "gotta go"

Why can't you see, why can't you be
Madly in love with me, too
Past emotion, but you've already spoken
I guess I'll have to make it through without you

I wasn't ready for your one-sided goodbye
You walked around like you loved me, I
Notice how the world tries to mask that word
"See you later," "gotta go", oh no

"Ride On"

Think of an angel tonight
Think of something, my baby
'Cause everyone needs something to believe in
Somebody's watching you tonight
You'll never know it now
But you're that one that they can't live, live without

As far as we know, we only live once
And this could be your masterpiece
And you never know what lies ahead
Life is made of falling down and getting back up again
The sun falls down every night and gets back up at dawn
Ride on

And think of beginnings tonight
Believe in so much more than you can ever try to imagine
And look at the sunset tonight
Believe in something that's greater than your tiny world
Or broken heart

As far as we know, we only live once
And this could be your masterpiece
And you never know what lies ahead
Life is made of falling down and getting back up again
The sun falls down every night and gets back up at dawn
Ride on

Some people waste it all looking for heaven
Maybe there's heaven, but what if
What if this is that heaven we're waiting for
Buddy, you don't know
You'll never know

Baby, I'm watching you tonight
You never saw it before
But you're that one that I can't live without
And I could go with you tonight
But love is a one-sided street
Don't know and I'm not brave enough to find out

As far as we know, we only live once
And this could be your masterpiece
And you never know what lies ahead
Life is made of falling down and getting back up again
The sun falls down every night and gets back up at dawn
Ride on

"Smokey Black Nights"

Let's watch
The tide chase
The waves
Onto the sand
I wonder
If a broken heart
Can feel the warmth
On my hand
And I wonder
What a piece
Of driftwood
Has seen all through
His lifetime
Let's walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights

I've seen
A million things
Spoke a million words
Now I only want
To speak to you

Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

Still through
The haze
I can make out
Constellations
I'll make one
Of you and me
As we sit
In the sand
And I saw
That sunset gleaming
As my eyes went wild
Let's walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights

I've played
A thousand songs
Sang a thousand words
Now I only want
To sing to you

Waited on a wire
Starin' at the fire
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

I've walked
A thousand miles
Smiled
A thousand smiles
Now I only smile
When I'm with you

Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

So walk with me
As the sweet
Wind dances
I'll write a song
For you and me
On the
Smokey black nights

"Halfway To Texas"

When I got mad at you, I always said I'd move to Texas
As a crazy little girl, what was I supposed to do
And I'm still crazy and I guess I haven't gotten much better
You're getting complicated, so I'll hit the road for someplace new

Well, I'm halfway to Texas, enjoying this roadside view
Just clearing my head, trying not to think back on you
And I'm trying to be strong
Maybe this whole thing is wrong
So I'll focus on the winding road leading to Texas

The wind in my hair is reminding me of the way you held me
Back home is far, I won't give up just yet
Right now you'll probably call wondering what I'm doing
And a voice in the wind will tell you I'm a long time gone

Well, I'm halfway to Texas, kinda thinking back on you
There's a thought in my head saying my best option is you
And I hope I can stay strong
I'm starting to think this is wrong
I'll just focus on the winding road leading to Texas

I've stopped the car, all I can think of is you
Maybe you were right, now I know how much I love you

I'm halfway to Texas, I'm turned around 'cause I love you
I'm coming back to you darling, wanna spend my life with you
And I know I have this wrong
I've stayed away from you this long
I'm taking you with me next time I go to Texas
I'm taking you with me next time I go to Texas

"Beautiful Days"

A moment just passed
And I know it's hard to believe, but it could have been something
And I could have smiled your way
Maybe you'd see there's something in me that loves you

I've been waiting for that sweet second that never was
That period of time, that vision in my mind
That feeling of melting into you
The time I could've lived it, but I didn't take a chance
Keep it on your mind, you'll always like to dance
Living like you love it, you love it just the same

'Cause life is made up of those moments
That you let slip away
Life is just beautiful, beautiful days

What if I hadn't turned around
And I'd kept walking, and looked through your starry eyes
Well, I would have known it then
Instead of just waiting to find out if I love you

I've been waiting for that sweet second that never was
That period of time, that vision in my mind
That feeling of melting into you
The time I could've lived it, but I didn't take the chance
Keep it on your mind, you'll always like to dance
Living like you love it, you love it just the same

Well, life is made up of those moments
That you let slip away
Life is just beautiful, beautiful days

Will you love me when tomorrow comes
It's just another Monday, baby won't you come with me
And see me in a different light
I could be your angel if you want to take a chance
Baby, if you knew me, you'd know I'll always dance
Love me like you need me, and I'll be yours, true

All that matters to me is you, babe
You're never gonna slip away
Life is just beautiful, life is just beautiful
Life is just beautiful, beautiful days
Beautiful days
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful days

"Your Heart's Somewhere Else"

I used to know everything you were thinking
But now I just know you're thinking 'bout someone else but me
I count the days, I count the words you say
I need to know you're alive and hoping I'll be by your side
Can't help but think that I'm driving you away
Don't let me think it's real, don't make me think you'll stay

I don't know if you're with me
I know you're standing here
I always turn around just to know you're there
And I deny it
Here, I'm crying
It's hard to tell myself
Your heart's somewhere else

I see you now, I don't see happiness
Don't want to hold you back but I still want you for myself
You look around, do you like the things you see
You're in a cage but I can't stand to let you free
I can't help but know that I'm driving you away
Don't let me think your love won't someday go away

I don't know if you're with me
I know you're standing here
Sometimes I turn around to see if you're still there
And I deny it
Here inside, I'm crying
It's hard to tell myself
Your heart's somewhere else

I never thought your eyes would lose their happiness
I know the longer you stay, the more you love me less

I don't know if you're with me
I know you're standing here
I always turn around just to know you're there
And I deny it
I am crying
It's hard to tell myself
Your heart's somewhere else
Your heart's somewhere else
Your heart's somewhere else

"Tim McGraw"

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On back roads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is

"When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place"

When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

Oh, think of me
Mmmm

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"

"Picture To Burn"

State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine I'll tell mine that you're gay
By the way...

I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned
You're just another picture to burn

There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned
You're just another picture to burn

And if you're missing me
You'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health...

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that...

Stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned
You're just another picture to burn

Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn...

"Teardrops On My Guitar"

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do

So, I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see

"A Place In This World"

I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's OK

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Oh I'm just a girl
Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh
Oh I'm just a girl

"Cold As You"

You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you, died for you

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

"The Outside"

I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason
I know I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go

I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right

So how can I ever try to be better
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
And I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late. So you see

You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too late to do anything

So how can I ever try to be better
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
And I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh, yeah

So how can I ever try to be better
Nobody ever lets me in
And I can still see you
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
And I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

"Tied Together With A Smile"

Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true 'cause I know you

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain

Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

You're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone
Goodbye, baby
With a smile, baby, baby

"Stay Beautiful"

Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
That watch him as he's walking home
Saying, "Does he know"
Will you ever know

You're beautiful
Every little piece love
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say, hey, by the way

You're beautiful
Every little piece love
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold
At least you'll know

You're beautiful
Every little piece love
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh, but if it don't
Will you stay
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
La la la
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
Na, na, na, na, na

"Should've Said No"

It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you feels wrong

You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."

You should've said "No", you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd
Get back to me (get back to me).
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same

You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."

You should've said "No", you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd,
Get back to me (get back to me).
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me

I can't resist
Before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it
Was she worth this

No... no, no, no...

You should've said "No", you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd,
Get back to me (get back to me).
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me

"Mary's Song (Oh My My My)"

She said, I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes and said, "Oh my, my, my"

Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh my, my, my, my

Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, "Oh my, my, my"

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside 'til the morning light
Oh my, my, my, my

A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said "I do" and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I

I'll be eighty-seven you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh my, my, my

"Our Song"

I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel
On the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong"
I say, "Nothing
I was just thinking
How we don't have a song"
And he says...

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have."
And when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen"
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up
The front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong
And been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway,
Well, on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice
All the roses
And the note that said...

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen"
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song...

'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen"
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again

Oh, yeah...
Oh-oh, yeah

I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen
And an old napkin
And I wrote down our song

"I'm Only Me When I'm With You"

Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are paintin' pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side

And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

Just a small town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do

And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
And only you can tell

...That I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you

"Invisible"

She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by

And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do

And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, we're invisible
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize

I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
Baby, let me love you
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile

"A Perfectly Good Heart"

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart

Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say, I still can't believe
That you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart

It's not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart

"Last Christmas"

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying 'I love you'. I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year
Maybe this year I'll give it to someone special

'Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

"Christmases When You Were Mine"

Please take down the mistletoe
'Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
'Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
Season's greetings, hope you're well
Well I'm doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
And everybody's here, except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold

But for me it's just a lonely time
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

Merry Christmas, everybody
That'll have to be something I just say this year
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

You were mine

"Santa Baby"

Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree for me
I've been an awful good girl, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
Well, I'll wait up for you, dear, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the boys I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
I've been an angel all year, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa, honey, there's one more thing I really do need
The deed
To a platinum mine, Santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
And I don't mean on the phone, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

"Silent Night"

Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah
Christ the Saviour is born
Christ our Saviour is born

Silent night, holy night
Son of God
Love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Jesus Lord at thy birth

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Christ the Saviour is born

"Christmas Must Be Something More"

What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing
Would the song still survive without five golden rings
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe
What would happen if God never let it snow
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie
Tell me, what would you find

You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

What if angels did not pay attention to
All the things that we wished they would always do
What if happiness came in a cardboard box
Then I think there is something we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away
Tell me, what would you find

You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships
Hundred-mile-an-hour lives
And it's this time of year
And everybody's here
It seems the last thing on your mind

Is that the day holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
But here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more

There's gotta be more
There's gotta be more

"White Christmas"

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
So may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

"Jump Then Fall"

I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard

I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, oh, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'mma stay through it all
So jump then fall

Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted

I had time to think it all over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me
'Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, oh, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'mma stay through it all
So jump then fall

The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

Whoa, oh, I need you baby
Don't be afraid, please,
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'mma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall, baby,
Jump then fall into me, into me

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine
And every time you're here
Baby I'll show you, I'll show you
You can jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah

"Untouchable"

Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you
I'm caught up in you

Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of Heaven

It's half full, and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway

But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on

Oh, in the middle of the night
Waking from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of Heaven

I'm caught up in you. Oh, oh

But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh, oh

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, come on

In the middle of the night
Waking from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of Heaven

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, oh, oh, oh

Like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
They're spelling out your name, oh

"Forever & Always (Piano Version)"

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
We caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When he said "forever and always"
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said "forever and always"

Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When he said "forever and always"
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said "forever and always"

You didn't mean it baby
I don't think so, oh oh oh
Back up, baby back up
Did you forget everything
Back up, baby back up
Did you forget everything

Back up, baby back up
Please back up, oh back up
Back up, baby back up

'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said "forever and always"

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When we said "forever and always"
'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said "forever and always"

You didn't mean it baby
You said "forever and always", yeah

"Come In With The Rain"

I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore

Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain

I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down
I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start

Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Oh, just know I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain

I've watched you so long
Screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say

But I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games
Just know I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain

I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore

"Superstar"

This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

Morning loneliness, comes around when I'm not
Dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face, I'd be
Counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
Sweet, sweet superstar, superstar

"The Other Side Of The Door"

In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said, "This time I've had enough."
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up

'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread

So babe if you know everything, tell me why you couldn't see
That when I left I wanted you to chase after me

Yeah, I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

And I'll scream out the window
"I can't even look at you"
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, "There's nothing you can say to make this right again
I mean it, I mean it."
What I mean is

I said, "Leave," but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you

"Fearless"

There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah
Oh yeah

We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

So, baby, drive slow
'Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake
I'm not usually this way
But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss
It's flawless
Really something
It's fearless

Oh yeah

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Oh-oh
Oh yeah

"Fifteen"

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say "Hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know I haven't seen you around before."

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And your mamma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
When you're fifteen
And your first kiss makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
Don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

"Love Story"

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello."
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go."
And I said

"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."

So, I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So, close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go"
And I said

"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'

Romeo, save me. They're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but it's real
Don't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."

Oh, oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said

"Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head I don't know what to think."
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

"Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

"Hey Stephen"

Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah

Hey, Stephen
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked
We were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to

Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey, Stephen
Boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So, come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Hey, Stephen
I've been holding back this feeling
So, I got some things to say to you, ha
I've seen it all
So I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do

The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey, Stephen
Why are people always leaving
I think you and I should stay the same

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So, come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

They're dimming the street lights
You're perfect for me. Why aren't you here tonight
I'm waiting alone now, so, come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine

Hey, Stephen
I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls
Well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you
(Ha-ha)

I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So, come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

...if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So, come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Myself
Can't help myself
I can't help myself

"White Horse"

Say you're sorry
That face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on
The days drag on
Stupid girl
I should have known, I should have known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

Maybe I was nave
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings
Now I know

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now
Oh, it's too late
To catch me now

"You Belong With Me"

You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset, she's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do

I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
"Hey, isn't this easy"

And you've got a smile
That could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while
Since she brought you down

You say you're fine I know you better than that
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that

She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby
You belong with me
You belong with me

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see
That I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby
You belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me

Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me

"Breathe"
(feat. Colbie Caillat)

[Taylor Swift]
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

[Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

It's 2 AM, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 AM, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh-oh

I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Mmm)
I'm sorry, (Yeah, yeah) I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry

"Tell Me Why"

I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know, that you see, what you're doing to me
Tell me why

You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh

I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know, that you see, what you're doing to me
Tell me why

Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why (Why)
Tell me why (Why)

I take a step back, let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know

"You're Not Sorry"

All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long
Baby but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry... no, no, no, no

You are looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
'Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry... no, no, no

You're not sorry... no, no, no

You had me crawling for you honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry... no, no, no

You're not sorry... no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

"The Way I Loved You"

He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2 AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2 AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2 AM and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh

And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

"Forever & Always"

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything

'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always

And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby
You said forever and always, yeah

"The Best Day"

I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today

"Change"

And it's a sad picture
The final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again
And you know it's all the same
Another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it

But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

So we've been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger
But we're faster and never scared

You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this

'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

Tonight we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah

"Mine"

You were in college working part-time waiting tables
Left a small town, and never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say, "Can you believe it"
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight
Two-thirty AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the "Goodbye"
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone."

You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine."

Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back

(Hold on)
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
(Hold on)
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

(Hold on)
Yeah, yeah
Do you believe it
(Hold on)
We're gonna make it now
(Hold on)
And I can see it
(Yes, yes)
I can see it now (see it now, see it now)

"Sparks Fly"

The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

I'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly

"Back To December"

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life Tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while

You've been good, busier than ever
We small-talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night,"
And I go back to December all the time

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call

And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was "Goodbye"

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night."
And I go back to December all the time

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry

Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night."
And I go back to December

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind

I go back to December all the time
All the time

"Speak Now"

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white-veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

Don't say "Yes", run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now."

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me
Don't you

Don't say "Yes", run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now."
Don't say "Yes", run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said, "Speak now."

Oh, la, la
Oh, oh
Say a single vow

I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace."
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white-veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

So, don't say "Yes", run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now."
And you say, "Let's run away now
I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around
When they said, "Speak now."

"Dear John"

Long were the nights
When my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through
Again

And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules every day

Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up, and this song is to let you know why

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed
With
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home
I should've known

Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism
To blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love then take it away

And you'll add my name
To your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret
How I ignored when they said
"Run as fast as you can."

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed
With
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

Dear John
I see it all now. It was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played
By your dark twisted games
When I loved you so
I should've known

You are an expert at "Sorry"
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry
Have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you've burned them out

But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So, don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed
With
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed
With
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song
You should've known

You should've known
Don't you think I was too young
You should've known

"Mean"

You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean

You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah

Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean

"The Story Of Us"

I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones."
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fall-out
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up I can't break through

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Next chapter

How'd we end up this way
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side

The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armour down
If you said you'd rather love than fight

So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah
But I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now

...and we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate 'cause we're going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

The end

"Never Grow Up"

Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up, never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

Oh, I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
I could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
Oh, don't you ever grow up
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up

"Enchanted"

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired lonely place

Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, "Have we met"
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy

And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, "Hey
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you."

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
(Please don't be in love with someone else)
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
(Please don't have somebody waiting on you)
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
(Please don't be in love with someone else)
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

"Better Than Revenge"

"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did."

Time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say "sabotage"

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress
She's better known
For the things that she does on the mattress

Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
They wouldn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress
She's better known
For the things that she does
On the mattress

Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but I always get the last word

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress
(She deserve it)
She's better known
For the things that she does on the mattress

Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
'Cause I don't think you do
(No, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
I don't think you do
I don't think you do

Let's hear the applause
(Come on, come on)
Come on show me how much better you are
(So much better, yeah)
So you deserve some applause 'cause you're so much better

She took him faster than you could say "sabotage"

"Innocent"

I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Lost your balance on a tightrope
It's never too late to get it back

"Haunted"

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

Oh, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead

Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I know, I know, I just know
You're not gone. You can't be gone. No

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted

Oh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it

"Last Kiss"

I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 158
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away
Away

I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last

"Long Live"

I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild

We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew
Our lives would never be the same

You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines wishing for right now

We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd"
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves
In ripped-up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Will you take a moment
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in

And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name

Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life, with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

"Ours"

Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now my time is theirs

Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine

And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate
If it's wrong and
Your hands are tough
But they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours

The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

"If This Was A Movie"

Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose."

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

If you're out there
If you're somewhere
If you're moving on
I've been waiting for you
Ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my front door
And I'd say

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said, "It's not that easy."
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby, what about the ending
Oh, I thought you'd be here by now, whoa
Thought you'd be here by now

"Superman"

Tall, dark and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say

And you smile and say, "How are you"
I'll say, "Just fine."
I always forget to tell you, I love you, I'll love you forever

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say

And you'll leave, got places to be
And I'll be OK
I always forget to tell you I love you, I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world I'll be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away but I never let you go
I'm love-struck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you

'Cause I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

When you come back down

"State Of Grace"

I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know
Is touch and go

We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know
Is don't let go

We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs
Four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles' heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never
(So you were never a saint
I've loved in shades of wrong)
Be the same
(We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild)

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

"Red"

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

(Red, red)
(Red, red)
Loving him was red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone (whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
(Red, red)
Oh, red
(Red, red)
Burning red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone (whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
(Red, red)
Yeah, yeah, red
(Red, red)
We're burning red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)

And that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head
(Red, red)
Comes back to me, burning red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)
Yeah, yeah
(Red, red)

His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street

"Treacherous"

Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you aget you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I... I, I, I... I, I, I

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, I'll get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

"I Knew You Were Trouble"

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies. He'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there)
So shame on me now (Knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

"All Too Well"

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost Upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone
And that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay
But I'm not fine at all

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on a tee-ball team
You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

Maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well

And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

"22"

It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time

Uh oh
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh (who's Taylor Swift anyway, ew)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time

Uh oh (hey)
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright (alright)
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh (oh, oh, oh)
22, ooh-ooh
I don't know about you
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ye-e-e-e-eah, hey
I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me (you don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh (oh  whoa)
22, ooh-ooh (dancing like)
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

"I Almost Do"

I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply
I bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say "Hello" to you
And risk another goodbye

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It's probably better off this way
And I confess, babe
In my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I wanna try again with you
And I almost do

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do

I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me

"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space. (What)
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me."
Remember how that lasted for a day
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you."

Ooh, we called it off again last night
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Ooh, yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Oh oh oh

I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say, "Never say never..."
Uggg... so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you,"
And I'm like... "I just... I mean this is exhausting, you know, like
We are never getting back together. Like, ever"

No

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, ooh, getting back together, ohhh
We, ooh, getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

"Stay Stay Stay"

I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away
But you stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, "Okay, let's talk."

And I said
Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to

Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hangin' out with you all the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life

Stay
And I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me, when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

That's so fun

"The Last Time"
(feat. Gary Lightbody)

[Gary Lightbody]
I find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I'm not sure how I got there
All roadsthey lead me here

I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

[Both]
And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

[Taylor Swift]
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave

And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

[Both]
And right before your eyes
I'm aching, no past
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
This is the last time I say it's been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore

Oh, oh, oh

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

This is the last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this

"Holy Ground"

I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York Time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light "Go"
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

And darling, it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of "I need you"
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

'Cause darling, it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you

It was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you

"Sad Beautiful Tragic"

Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

In dreams I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons, and, darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen
Hang up, give up and for the life of us we can't get back

A beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful

What we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

"The Lucky One"

New to town with a made up name in the angel's city
Chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream

You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties' queen

Another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh

Now it's big black cars, and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page

And they tell you that you're lucky
But you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights. You wonder if you'll make it out alive

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh

It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

'Cause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right

Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh

Yeah they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, oh, oh

"Everything Has Changed"
(duet with Ed Sheeran)

[Ed Sheeran]
You good to go

[Taylor Swift]
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind making me feel like

I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now

[Both]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

[Ed Sheeran]
And all my walls stood tall painted blue
And I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you

[Taylor Swift]
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right

[Both]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
Oh, oh, oh
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

[Taylor Swift]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Both]
All I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

[Taylor Swift]
All I know is we said, "Hello"
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain and everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

"Starlight"

I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up late one night out the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, "Look at you worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way."
He was tryna skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight
Don't you dream impossible things"

Like "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh, ooh, dancing with me
Ooh, ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight, starlight
Don't you dream impossible things

"Begin Again"

Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do

Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl
Who had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies that your family
Watches
Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that
And for the first time what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months

Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

"The Moment I Knew"

You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that 'baby I'm right here' smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy

Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there's one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
"He said he'd be here."

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know
And what do you do when the one
Who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show

You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me singing
"Happy birthday to you"
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

Ooh, I knew
Ooh

You called me later
And said, "I'm sorry, I didn't make it,"
And I said, "I'm sorry too,"
And that was the moment I knew

"Come Back... Be Here"

You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself, "Don't get attached,"
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back... be here, come back... be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back... be here, come back... be here

The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would have played so nonchalant

Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back... be here, come back... be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back... be here, come back... be here

This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away

New York... be here
But you're in London and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around

This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back... be here, come back... be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back... be here, come back... be here

I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back... be here
Come back... be here

"Girl At Home"

Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Uh, uh
Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that

I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But honey I am no-one's exception
This I have previously learned

So don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Uh, uh
Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you got me alone
And I say
Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that

I just wanna make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And yeah I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her

Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Uh, uh
Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone
And I say
Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that

Call a cab
Lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab
Lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned

Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Uh, uh
Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Uh, uh
Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that

It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn't once been just like her

"Welcome To New York"

Walking through a crowd
The village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud
Heartbeats under coats
Everybody here
Wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't
Heard before
And it said

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you

But they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on
Apartment floors
Took our broken hearts
Put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else
Before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and
Girls and girls

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York

Like any great love it keeps you
Guessing

Like any true love

It drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't
Change anything anything
Anything

"Blank Space"

Nice to meet you, where you been
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play"
Ayy

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

"Style"

Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh, it's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)

I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, hmm, yeah
I say, "I heard, oh, that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl."

He says, "What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you," and I
I said, "I've been there, too, a few times."

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go)
We never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home, yeah
Just take me home
(Out of style)

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down (when we go)
We come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

"Out Of The Woods"

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet Good
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet Good
Are we out of the woods

Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (we decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinkin'

Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet Good
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Oh
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet Good
Are we out of the woods

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started cryin', baby, I did, too
But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out and said, "I'm settin' you free,"
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were lookin' at me

You were lookin' at me
You were lookin' at me

Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
I remember
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet Good
Oh, I remember

Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
(Yeah)
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet Good

Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods

Are we in the clear yet
(Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet
(Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet Good

Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods

Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet Good
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet Good

"All You Had To Do Was Stay"

(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)

People like you always want back the love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
The more I think about it now the less I know
All I know is that you drove us off the road

Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay
Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye

Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay

Let me remind you
This was what you wanted
You ended it
You were all I wanted
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this

Oh, all you had to do was...

"Shake It Off"

I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't see, mmm-mmm

I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

You could've been getting down to this sick beat.

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like "Oh, my God" but I'm just gonna shake.
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby We can shake, shake, shake

"I Wish You Would"

It's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that I'd never forget you as long as I live
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

It's 2 AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that I'd never forget you as long as I live
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)

(I wish I, wish I)

2 AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that I'd never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that I'd never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore
I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)

I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish you would

"Bad Blood"

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Did you have to do this I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood

So take a look what you've done

Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Did you think we'd be fine Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last
Now did you think it all through All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't, so if you're coming my way, just don't

Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love

If you live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey)
You say sorry just for show (hey)
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (hey)

"Wildest Dreams"

He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ha, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' (Burnin') it (It) down (Down)
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories

"How You Get The Girl"

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Stand there like a ghost
Shaking from the rain, rain
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane"
Say it's been a long six months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want

And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And then, you say

I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (Oh-oh, oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl

Remind her how it used to be, be, yeah-yeah
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tell her how you must have lost your mind, ooh-ooh
When you left her all alone
And never told her why, why

And that's how it works
That's how you lost the girl
And now, you say

I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
Yeah, yeah

And you know
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
That I don't want you to go, oh, oh

Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me, yeah-yeah
And then you say

'Cause I want you for worse or for better (Worse or for better)
I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever (I want you forever and ever)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (This is how it works)
And that's how it works

That's how you get the girl, girl
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

That's how it works
That's how you got the girl

"This Love"

Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind, only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone

Been losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)

Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young, you just run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
(This love) This love left a permanent mark
(This love) This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
(This love) These hands had to let it go free, and
(This love) This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love)
This love, this love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

"I Know Places"

(I, I, I, I I, I, I, I I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I)

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They take their shots, but we're bulletproof
I know places
And you know for me, it's always you
I know places
In the dead of night, your eyes so green
I know places
And I know for you, it's always me
I know places

(I, I, I, I I, I, I, I I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I)

"Clean"

The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You're still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

There was nothing left to do (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Said, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
(Oh)

The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

(Oh, oh)
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
(Oh, oh, oh)
Think I'm finally clean

"Wonderland"

Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down a rabbit hole

You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds

Oh

Didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
Eh eh

Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed

But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams

Oh

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile

Oh

Didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind

But darling, we found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
Eh eh

Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland

I reached for you but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else to make you feel like what we had
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad

Oh

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (last forever)
Eh eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better (never better)
Eh eh

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (wonderland)
And we pretended it could last forever (in wonderland)

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (wonderland)
And life was never worse but never better
In wonderland

"You Are In Love"

One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast
You play it back
Buttons on a coat
Lighthearted joke
No proof, not much
But you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects
The chain on your neck
He says, "Look up."
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
But you felt enough

You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence) you
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home) you
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love

Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word
And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much
But it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight then you talk
One night he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says
"You're my best friend."
And you knew what it was
He is in love

You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence) you
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home) you
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love

And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe 'round and 'round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence) you
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home) you
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love

You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence) you
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home) you
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love

"New Romantics"

We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We're so young but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace

We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come on, come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded
It's so romantic (it's so romantic)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

Oh, 'cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

'Cause baby, I could build a castle (castle)
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

"...Ready For It"

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know (No one has to know)

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it
Oh, are you ready for it

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night (Night), in my dreams (My dreams)
You should see the things we do (We do), baby (Baby), hmm (Eh)
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (My dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you (I know I'm gonna be with you)
So I take my time
In the middle of the night

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it

"End Game"
(feat. Ed Sheeran and Future)

[Taylor Swift and Future]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
I wanna be your end game, end game

Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
 I got some big enemies (Yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)
You like the bad ones, too

[Future]
You so dope, don't overdose, I'm so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat
I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me (Yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (Yeah)
I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (What they like)
You love it, I love it too 'cause you're my type (You're my type)
You hold me down and I protect you with my life

[Taylor Swift and Future]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play

[Taylor Swift]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Ed Sheeran]
Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

[Taylor Swift]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Taylor Swift and Future]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
 I got some big enemies
Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too

[Taylor Swift]
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

[Swift, Future, and Ed Sheeran]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Me and you, first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team now, A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (Oh, I do)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

"I Did Something Bad"

I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it lookohso easy

'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson-red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit
Then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit
'Cause he had it coming

They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me

They never see it comin', what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, "Don't throw away a good thing."
But if he drops my name
Then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change
Then he had it comin'

They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

It just felt so good

They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof, their receipts and reasons

They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
So light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up, go ahead and light me up (light me up)

Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up (light me up), light me up

They say I did something bad (oh)
Then why's it feel so good (so good)
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good
Most fun I ever had (most fun I ever had)
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good (good), good

Oh, you say I did something bad
(You say I did something bad)
Why's it feel so good, good
So bad, why's it feel so good
Why's it feel, why's it feel so good (bad)
It just felt so good, good

"Don't Blame Me"

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

I've been breaking hearts a long time
And toying with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacing, I just need you

For you
I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, "She's gone too far this time."

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Don't blame me

If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)
Echoes (echoes) of your name inside my mind
Halo, hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

And, baby, for you
I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away
I'd beg you on my knees to stay

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

I get so high, oh
Every time you'reevery time you're loving me
You're loving me
Trip of my life, oh
Every time you'reevery time you're touching me
You're touching me

Every time you'reevery time you're loving me

Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life
(Using for the rest of my life. Oh)

I get so high, oh
Every time you'reevery time you're loving me
You're loving me
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

"Delicate"

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe
But you can make me a drink

Dive bar on the East Side, where you at
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do

'Cause I like you
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe
But you can make me a drink

Is it cool that I said all that
Is it chill that you're in my head
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that
Is it too soon to do this yet
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it Isn't it Isn't it
Isn't it
Isn't it Isn't it Isn't it
Isn't it
Delicate

Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share

'Cause I like you
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe
But you can make me a drink

Is it cool that I said all that
Is it chill that you're in my head
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that
Is it too soon to do this yet
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it Isn't it Isn't it
Isn't it
Isn't it Isn't it Isn't it
Isn't it
Delicate

Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
'Cause I like you

Is it cool that I said all that
Is it chill that you're in my head
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Yeah, I want you
Is it cool that I said all that
Is it too soon to do this yet
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
'Cause I like you
Is it cool that I said all that
Isn't it Isn't it Isn't it Isn't it
Is it chill that you're in my head
Isn't it Isn't it Isn't it Isn't it
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it Isn't it Isn't it Isn't it
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that
Isn't it Isn't it Isn't it Isn't it
Is it too soon to do this yet
Isn't it Isn't it Isn't it
'Cause I know that it's delicate

"Look What You Made Me Do"

I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams

(Ooh, look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you just made me do)
"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now."
(Look what you just made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
"Why"
(Look what you just made me do)
"Oh, 'cause she's dead" (Oh)

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

"So It Goes..."

See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip, trippin' when you're gone

'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

And all the pieces fall
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes

Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your grey days clear and
Wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip, skippin' when I'm gone

'Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

And all the pieces fall
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes

Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes

You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting
I did a number on you
But, honestly, baby, who's counting
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting
Who's counting
1, 2, 3

And all the pieces fall (pieces fall)
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment (caught up, caught up)
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
I'm yours to keep (oh)
And I'm yours to lose (baby)
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes

Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes

"Gorgeous"

Gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doing, I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)

Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say
You're gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (but you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (dark room, dark room)
If you got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
(Honey, it hurts)

Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say
You're gorgeous

You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Yeugh), alone
Unless, you wanna come along (Oh)

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say (I say)
You're gorgeous

You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (It turns back to sad)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have (What I can have)
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous

"Getaway Car"

No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn't see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

"" marks the spot, where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lying to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark

You were driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinking
And I was just drinking
Well he was running after us, I was screaming, 'Go, go, go'
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (we're both sorry)

"" marks the spot, where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart

You were driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

We were jet-set Bonnie and Clyde
Until I switched to the other side
To the other side
It's no surprise, I turned you in
'Cause us traitors never win

I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me

Driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Should've known)
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

I was riding in a getaway car
I was crying in a getaway car
I was dying in a getaway car
Said 'goodbye' in a getaway car

I was riding in a getaway car
I was crying in a getaway car
I was dying in a getaway car
Said 'goodbye' in a getaway car

"King Of My Heart"

I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up my mind, I'm better off being alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin' me "baby" like tryin' on clothes

Salute to me I'm your American Queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa

And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

Late in the night, the city's asleep
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury

Salute to me I'm your American Queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
(Inside my room, oh)
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do (Where you do)

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul, ooh whoa

And all at once (Hey), I've been waiting, waiting (Waiting)
Ooh, whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one
I have been waiting (Waiting), waiting (Waiting)
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

Is this the end of all the endings
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul (My soul), ooh whoa

And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once

"Dancing With Our Hands Tied"

I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, 25 years old
Oh, how were you to know and

My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know what

I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling

But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance
Oh, through an avalanche
And say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me

I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling

But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
(Ooh, we had our hands tied)
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again (Again)

Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Oh, yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time (First time, first time)
Yeah, we were dancing (Oh)
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
(Dancing with our hands tied)
Yeah, we were dancing (Ooh)
And I had a bad feeling (Had a bad feeling)
But we were dancing

(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Hands tied, hands tied (Dancing)

"Dress"

Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo

All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah

Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I'm spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothing about

All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha

Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah

There is an indentation in the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

"This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things"

It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

So why'd you have to rain on my parade
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me
This is why we can't have nice things

It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm)
If only you weren't so shady

This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Yeah)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me
This is why we can't have

Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about the he-said, she-said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face

This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Darling)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Uh-uh) things (Oh no), honey (Baby, oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
(And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them
I had to take them
(And here's to my baby)
Nice things, honey
(They didn't care about that he-said, she-said)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me
This is why we can't have nice things

"Call It What You Want"

My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doing better than I ever was

'Cause
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover
Making forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparking up my darkest night

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November, holding my breath
Slowly I said, "You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me"
Yes (would you run away)

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

(Call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
Call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want
To

"New Year's Day"

There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

"I Forgot That You Existed"

How many days did I spend thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong
Lived in the shade you were throwing
'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
And I couldn't get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
Free rent, living in my mind

But then something happened one magical night

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show

But you showed who you are, then one magical night

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
It's all just a blur

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
I did, I did, I did
It isn't hate, it's just indifference
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
So, yeah

"Cruel Summer"

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard"
He looks up, grinning like a devil

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

"Lover"

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years

Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close forever and ever
And ah, take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my
Lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close forever and ever
And ah, take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my
Lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be over-dramatic and true to my
Lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat
Lover

Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close forever and ever
And ah, take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my
Lover

"The Man"

I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play
I'd be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man)
Then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Oh)
I'd be the man (Yeah)
I'd be the man (I'd be the man)

If I was a man, then I'd be the man

"The Archer"

Combat
I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that
But what if I do

'Cause cruelty
Wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches
I almost said to you

Easy they come
Easy they go
I jump from the train
I ride off alone
I never grew up
It's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay

Dark side
I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright
Right, right, right here

And I cut off
My nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection
For years and years

I wake in the night
I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire
Invisible smoke
And all of my heroes
Die all alone
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Screaming, "Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay"

(I see right through me, I see right through me)

'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

All the king's horses
All the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies
Started out friends
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay

(I see right through me, I see right through me)

Who could stay
Who could stay
Who could stay
You could stay
You could stay

Combat
I'm ready for combat

"I Think He Knows"

I think he knows
His footprints on the sidewalk
Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night
I think he knows
His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it's mine

He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
It's like I'm 17, nobody understands
No one understands

He got my heartbeat
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, oh, I mean
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

I think he knows
When we get all alone
I'll make myself at home
And he'll want me to stay
I think he knows
He better lock it down
Or I won't stick around
'Cause good ones never wait (Ha)

He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
He's so obsessed with me and, boy, I understand
Boy, I understand

He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, oh, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my soul
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my soul

Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We can follow the sparks, I'll drive
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We can follow the sparks, I'll drive
"So where we gonna go"
I whisper in the dark
"Where we gonna go"
I think he knows

He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue (Baby)
Got that, oh, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like (Yeah)
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my soul
I want you, bless my (Oh, baby)
I want you, bless my soul (He got my heartbeat)
I want you, bless my (Skipping down 16th Avenue, baby)
I want you, bless my soul
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows

"Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince"

You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at sixteen, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)

No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men
Darling, I'm scared (Ah)

No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I just thought you should know
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win)

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
Oh, I just thought you should know (You should know)
It's you and me, there's nothing like this (Like this)
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue (Paint it blue)
Voted most likely to run away with you

And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win), I just thought you should know

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
"She's a bad, bad girl"

"Paper Rings"

The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

(Ayy)
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings in picture frames in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

(Ayy)
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause you waited your whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)
Ah

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings in picture frames in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
Uh huh

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right, you're the one I want
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Ah-ah, darling, you're the one I want
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings in picture frames in all my dreams
You're the one I want
In paper rings in picture frames in all my dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

You're the one I want, one I want
You're the one I want, one I want

"Cornelia Street"

We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

I don't wanna lose you (Hope it never ends)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)

"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car

"Death By A Thousand Cuts"

My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story's over, why am I still writing pages

'Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not

It's death by a thousand cuts

My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)

Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no

I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"

"London Boy"

[Idris Elba and James Corden]
We can go driving in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just 'round London
Alright, yeah

I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives

You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)

And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English

You know I love a London boy, I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you

So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney, on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you (Oh)

You know I love a London boy, I enjoy walking SoHo
Drinking in the afternoon (Yeah)
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you (You)
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true (Yeah)
You know I love a London boy (Oh)
Boy (Oh), I fancy you (I fancy you, ooh)

So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
I, I, I fancy you
Oh whoa, oh, I
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney, on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Ooh)
Wanna be with you
I fancy you (Yeah), I fancy you
Oh whoa, ah

"Soon You'll Get Better"
(feat. Dixie Chicks)

The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you

Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I say to you

Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to
What am I supposed to do
If there's no you

This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because
'Cause I have to

Ooh-ah
You'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

"False God"

We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I'd fly to you

And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town
I'm New York City, I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love

I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah

Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love

"You Need To Calm Down"

You are somebody that I don't know
But you're taking shots at me like it's Patrn
And I'm just like, "Damn
It's 7 AM"

Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey
Are you OK"

And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned the lesson
That stressing and obsessing
'Bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to just stop
Like, can you just not step on my gown
You need to calm down"

You are somebody that we don't know
But you're coming at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad
When you could be GLAAD
(You could be GLAAD)

Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Just making that sign
Must've taken all night

You just need to take several seats
And then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream
About all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to just stop
Like, can you just not step on his gown
You need to calm down"

And we see you over there on the Internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now
We all got crowns
You need to calm down

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
(You need to calm down)
You're being too loud
(You're being too loud)
And I'm just like
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to just stop
(Can you stop)
Like, can you just not step on our gowns
You need to calm down"

"Afterglow"

I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something you didn't do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no

Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there's no us
Why'd I have to break what I love so much
It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say

Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh

I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much
It's on your face, don't walk away, I need to say

Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
I'm sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

Tell me that you're still mine
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say

Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

"ME"
(feat. Brendon Urie of Panic At The Disco)

[Taylor Swift]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

I know that I'm a handful baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like me-e-e-eh

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me-e-eh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you

And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e-eh

[Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Living in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like me-e-e-eh

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company-e-e-eh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you

And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e-eh

[Single version
"Hey, kids.
Spelling is fun"]

Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
Strike the band up 1, 2, 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me

Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
And you can't spell "awesome" without "me"
I promise that you'll never find another like me-e-e-eh

Yeah, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(And I want you, baby)
I'm the only one of me
(I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me-e-e-eh
(Baby, that's the fun of me)

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e-eh

Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team"
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
But you know there is a "me"
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me-e-e-eh

Strike the band up 1, 2, 3
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You can't spell "awesome" without "me"
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you

And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e-eh

"It's Nice To Have A Friend"

Ooh
Ooh

School bell rings, walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves, you give me one
"Wanna hang out" Yeah, sounds like fun
Video games, you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents

It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)

Light pink sky up on the roof
Sun sinks down, no curfew
20 questions, we tell the truth
You've been stressed out lately, yeah, me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand

It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)

Church bells ring, carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow
Call my bluff, call you "Babe"
Have my back, yeah, every day
Feels like home, stay in bed
The whole weekend

It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
(Ooh)

"Daylight"

My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (daylight), I only see daylight (daylight)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burning red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
(And I can still see it all)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(I once believed love would be burning red)

Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things that I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
Not the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I, I just think that
You are what you love

"the 1"

I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though

I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinee
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

But we were something, don't you think so
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the Internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now

I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day, waking up alone

But we were something, don't you think so
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

Hey, yeah-yeah
I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today

We were something, don't you think so
Ros flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

"cardigan"

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancing in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends
I, I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleeding

'Cause I knew you
Stepping on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy
I, I knew you
Leaving like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasing shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standing in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

"the last great american dynasty"

Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorce do it"

The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

And they said, "There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything."

Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dal

And they said, "There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything."

They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness
Their men and bad habits, and then it was bought by me

Who knows, if I never showed up what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
I had a marvelous time
Ruining everything
A marvelous time
Ruining everything
A marvelous time
I had a marvelous time

"exile"
(feat. Bon Iver)

[Justin Vernon]
I can see you standin', honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin' but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defendin' now
You were my town
Now I'm in exile seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before

Hoo, hoo-ooh
Hoo, hoo-ooh
Hoo, hoo-ooh

[Taylor Swift]
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now
You were my crown
Now I'm in exile seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door

[Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift]
So step right out
There is no amount
Of cryin' I can do for you

All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs
So many signs (You didn't even see the signs)

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now
You were my town
Now I'm in exile seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door

So step right out
There is no amount
Of cryin' I can do for you

All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
You never gave a warning sign (All this time)
(So many times) I never learned to read your mind
(So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)
You never gave a warning sign
Ah, ah

"my tears ricochet"

We gather here
We line up weeping in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire
You'll be made of ashes, too

Even on my worst day
Did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me
'Cause I loved you
I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around saving face
And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake
Cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

We gather stones
Never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw
Some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to
Have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels
That I gave you
As you bury me

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake
Cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want
Just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you
When I'm screaming at the sky
And when you can't sleep at night
You hear my stolen lullabies

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame
Drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

"mirrorball"

I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break it's in a million pieces

Hush
When no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush
I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten

Hush
When no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush
I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

And they called off the circus
Burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses
And the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
I'm still a believer but I don't know why
I've never been a natural
All I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything
To keep you looking at me

Because I'm a mirrorball
I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself
Tonight

"seven"

Please picture me
In the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet
In the swing
Over the creek
I was too scared to jump in, but I, I was high
In the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things

Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with
Me and we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on

Please picture me
In the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream
Ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I

Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Our love lasts so long

"august"

Salt air
And the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers
Of "Are you sure"
"Never have I ever before"

But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Your back
Beneath the sun
Wishing I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school
I remember thinking I had you

But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Back when we were still changing for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say "Meet me behind the mall"
So much for summer love, and saying "Us"
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose
No

But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine, mine

'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember
Remember when I pulled up
And said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans
Just in case you'd call
Back when I was living for the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
"Meet me behind the mall"

(Remember when I pulled up)
(And said "Get in the car")
(And then canceled my plans)
(Just in case you'd call)
(Back when I was living for the hope of it all)
(For the hope of it all)
("Meet me behind the mall")

Remember when I pulled up
And said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans
Just in case you'd call
Back when I was living for the hope of it all
(For the hope of it all)
For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all

"this is me trying"

I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway

I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying

They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pourin' out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying

At least I'm trying

And it's hard to be at a party
When I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days
When all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel
On the one screen in my town

And I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying (And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying

At least I'm trying

"illicit affairs"

Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head
Keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You'll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings
And longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
...a million little times

Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don't even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times

And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings
And stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
...a million little times

And you wanna scream
Don't call me "kid"
Don't call me "baby"
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me "kid"
Don't call me "baby"
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else
And you know damn well
For you I would ruin myself
...a million little times

"invisible string"

Green was the color of the grass where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt when you were 16 at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money

Time
Curious time
Gave me no compasses
Gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me

Bad was the blood of the song in the cab on your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer

Time
Mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me

A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold tied me to you

Cold was the steel of my axe to grind for the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves when I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven

Time
Wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool
Baby with me
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

(Ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah)

"mad woman"

What did you think I'd say to that
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back
They strike to kill and you know I will
You know I will

What do you sing on your drive home
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn
Does she smile
Or does she mouth, "Fuck you forever"

Every time you call me crazy
I get more crazy
What about that
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firing at your yacht
They say "move on"
But you know I won't
And women like hunting witches, too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
It's obvious that wanting me dead has really brought you two together

Every time you call me crazy
I get more crazy
What about that
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

I'm taking my time
Taking my time
'Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb
Watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin
Has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad
Should be scathing like me
But no one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad

You made her like that

"epiphany"

Keep your helmet
Keep your life, son
Just a flesh wound
Here's your rifle

Crawling up the beaches now
"Sir, I think he's bleeding out"
And some things you just can't speak about

With you, I serve
With you, I fall down
Down
Watch you breathe in
Watch you breathin' out
Out

Something med school
Did not cover
Someone's daughter
Someone's mother

Holds your hand through plastic now
"Doc, I think she's crashing out"
And some things you just can't speak about

Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen

With you, I serve
With you, I fall down
Down (Down)
Watch you breathe in
Watch you breathin' out
Out

With you, I serve
With you, I serve
With you, I fall down (Down)
Down (Down)
Watch you breathe in
Watch you breathe in
Watch you breathin' out (Out)
Out (Out)

Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen

"betty"

Betty, I won't make assumptions about why you switched your homeroom
But I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard when I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me
Would you want me
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing
I'm only seventeen
I don't know anything but I know I miss you

Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing from the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found, I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me
Would you want me
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing
I'm only seventeen
I don't know anything but I know I miss you

I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up
Like a figment of my worst intentions
She said "James, get in, let's drive"
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her but
I dreamt of you all summer long

Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now but, it's finally sinking in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when you see my face again
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you

So, I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me
Will you love me
Will you kiss me on the porch in front of all your stupid friends
If you kiss me
Will it be just like I dreamed it Will it patch your broken wings
I'm only seventeen
I don't know anything
But I know I miss you
Standing in your cardigan
Kissing in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight, you know I miss you

"peace"

Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly this summer it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And it's just around the corner, darlin'
'Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace

But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details
But you got a friend in me
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace

Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends
It's like I'm wastin' your honor

And you know that I'd
Swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough
But there's robbers to the east
Clowns to the West
I'd give you my sunshine
Give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come
If you're standing with me

But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details
But you got a friend in me
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace

"hoax"

My only one
My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
This has frozen my ground

Stood on the cliffside
Screaming, "Give me a reason"
Your faithless love's the only hoax
I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue
But you
No other sadness in the world would do

My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire

Stood on the cliffside
Screaming "Give me a reason"
Your faithless love's the only hoax
I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue
But you
No other sadness in the world would do

You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died, so what's the movie for
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password, so I let you in the door
You knew you won, so what's the point of keeping score
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
Darling, this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart

My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart

Don't want no other shade of blue
But you
No other sadness in the world would do

"the lakes"

Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me
I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse
No, not without you

"willow"

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an openshut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a 90's trend

Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an openshut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

"champagne problems"

You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

Dom Prignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
"This dorm was once a madhouse"
I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready, so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
"She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

"gold rush"

Gleaming
Twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships
On waters so inviting
I almost jump in

I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

What must it be like
To grow up that beautiful
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door
At dinner parties
I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town
We wandered 'round had never
Seen a love as pure as it
And then it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it could never be

'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
And I don't like a gold rush

What must it be like
To grow up that beautiful
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I can't dare to dream about you anymore
At dinner parties
I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town
We never found will never
See a love as pure as it
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it will never be
Gleaming
Twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships
On waters so inviting
I almost jump in

"'tis the damn season"

If I wanted to know
Who you were hanging with
While I was gone, I would've asked you
It's the kind of cold
Fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There's an ache in you
Put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me

So we could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm staying at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

I parked my car
Right between the Methodist and the school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run but only so far
I escaped it too
Remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you
It's okay with me

We could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm staying at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies
Messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

Sleep in half the day
Just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait
If you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to LA
And the so-called friends who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul who can tell which smiles I'm faking
And the heart I know I'm breaking is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known

We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving
And I'll be yours for the weekend
'Tis the damn season

We could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm staying at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies
Messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
It always leads to you and my hometown

"tolerate it"

I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you, I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser and I

I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listen, I polish plates until they gleam and glisten
You're so much older and wiser and I

I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

While you were out building other worlds, where was I
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine
But what would you do if I

Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
I sit and watch you

"no body, no crime"
(feat. HAIM)

[HAIM]
He did it
He did it

[Taylor Swift]
Este's a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Este's been losing sleep
Her husband's acting different and it smells like infidelity
She says, "That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"
No, there ain't no doubt
I think I'm gonna call him out
She says

[Taylor Swift and HAIM]
I think he did it but I just can't prove it
I think he did it but I just can't prove it
I think he did it but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't letting up until the day I die

[HAIM]
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

[Taylor Swift]
Este wasn't there
Tuesday night at Olive Garden at her job or anywhere
He reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house his truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out
'Cause

[Taylor Swift and HAIM]
I think he did it but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't letting up until the day I die
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was 15
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me ("She was with me dude")
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy

[Taylor Swift]
They think she did it but they just can't prove it
They think she did it but they just can't prove it
She thinks I did it but she just can't prove it

[Taylor Swift and HAIM]
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't letting up until the day he
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't letting up until the day he
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't letting up until the day he
Died

"happiness"

Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see this for what it is
But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given
Is just shit we're dividin' up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention
I haven't met the new me yet

There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I didn't mean that
Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury
You haven't met the new me yet

There'll be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things, I believe
There is happiness

In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
And there is happiness

I can't make it go away by making you a villain
I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him, too

Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven't met the new me yet
And I think she'll give you that

There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you, too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
Oh, leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

"dorothea"

Hey Dorothea
Do you ever stop and think about me
When we were younger
Down in the park
Honey, making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya

Oooh
This place is the same as it ever was
Oooh
But you won't like it that way

It's never too late
To come back to my side
The stars in your eyes
Shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of being known
For who you know
You know that you'll always know me
Dorothea
Dorothea

Ooh, you're a queen
Selling dreams
Selling make-up and magazines
Ooh, from you I'd buy anything

Hey Dorothea
Do you ever stop and think about me
When it was calmer
Skipping the prom
Just to piss off your mom
And her pageant schemes
And damn, Dorothea
They all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul
I met under the bleachers Well

Oooh
I guess I'll never know
Oooh
And you'll go on with the show

But it's never too late
To come back to my side
The stars in your eyes
Shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of being known
For who you know
You know you'll always know me

Dorothea
Dorothea

Oooh
Oooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh
Oooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Dorothea

"coney island"
(feat. The National)

[Taylor Swift]
Break my soul in two
Looking for you but you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon
Did I close my fist around something delicate
Did I shatter you

And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island wondering where did my baby go
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Matt Berninger and Taylor Swift]
The question pounds my head
"What's a lifetime of achievement"
If I pushed you to the edge
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care
'Cause we were like the mall before the Internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line by the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest gray
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium
I think that I forgot to say your name

I'm on a bench in Coney Island wondering where did my baby go
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold
Over and over

Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down

The sight that flashed before me was your face
When the sun goes down
But I think that I forgot to say your name
Over and over
Sorry for not making you my
Making you my
Making you my centerfold

"ivy"

How's one to know
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith-forgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand

And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don't, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living

Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you

I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
He's in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants what's only yours

Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered

Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose, the time is near
What would he do if he found us out
Crescent moon, coast is clear
Spring breaks loose, but so does fear
He's gonna burn this house to the ground

How's one to know
I'd live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
And drink my husband's wine

Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you
And I'm covered in you

So yeah, it's a fire
It's a goddamn blaze in the dark
And you started it
You started it
So yeah, it's a war
It's the goddamn fight of my life
And you started it
You started it

Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered
In you
In you
Now I'm covered in you
In you

"cowboy like me"

And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent-like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said, "Dancin' is a dangerous game."

Oh, I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
I'm never gonna love again

I've got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me

Never wanted love
Just a fancy car
Now I'm waiting by the phone
Like I'm sitting in an airport bar

You had some tricks up your sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me

Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

You're a cowboy like me

Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up
And the old men that I've swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunching have their stories about
When you passed through town
But that was all before I locked it down

Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con

I've had some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me
And I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again

"long story short"

Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles
'Til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it
'Til your high heels break

And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you
I'm all about you

Actually
I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us
This time I'm ready

'Cause I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you
I'm all about you

No more keepin' score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
No more tug of war
Now I just know there's more (Know there's more)
No more keepin' score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
And my waves meet your shore
Ever and evermore

Past me
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
Your nemeses will defeat themselves
Before you get the chance to swing
And he's passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it
Everywhere you go

And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff
Long story short, I survived
Now I'm all about you
(And now) I'm all about you, ah
(And now) I'm all about you
(And now) I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you
(And now) Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you

Long story short, it was a bad time
Long story short, I survived

"marjorie"

Never be so kind, you forget to be clever
Never be so clever, you forget to be kind

And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were talking to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

Never be so polite, you forget your power
Never wield such power, you forget to be polite

And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were listening to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

The autumn chill that wakes me up
You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
You'd always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I should've asked you questions
I should've asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me

What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were singing to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
I know better
But I still feel you all around
I know better
But you're still around

"closure"

It's been a long time
And seeing the shape of your name
Still spells out pain
It wasn't right
The way it all went down
Looks like you know that now

Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya
Right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over
I don't need your "closure"
Your "closure"

Don't treat me like some situation that needs to be handled
I'm fine with my spite
And my tears
And my beers and my candles
I can feel you smoothing me over

Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya
Right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over
I don't need your "closure"
Your "closure"
Your "closure"
Your "closure"

I know I'm just a
Wrinkle in your new life
Staying "friends"
Would iron it out so nice
Guilty, guilty reaching out across the sea
That you put between you and me
But it's fake
And it's oh so unnecessary

Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya
Right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over
I don't need your "closure"
"Closure"
Your "closure"
Your "closure"

"evermore"
(feat. Bon Iver)

[Taylor Swift]
Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light

I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

Hey December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for

I rewind the tape but all it does is pause
On the very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed

[Taylor Swift and Justin Vernon]
And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore
(Evermore)

[Justin Vernon]
Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause
To be certain we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross

[Taylor Swift and Justin Vernon]
And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost)
I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause)
I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again)
(If you think of all the costs)
It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)
(Or the violence of the dog days)
(Out on waves, being tossed)
(I'm on waves, out being tossed)
I swear (Is there a line that we could just go cross)
You were there

And I was catching my breath
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldn't be for
Evermore
Evermore
Evermore
This pain wouldn't be for evermore
Evermore

"right where you left me"

Friends break up, friends get married
Strangers get born, strangers get buried
Trends change, rumors fly through new skies
But I'm right where you left me
Matches burn after the other
Pages turn and stick to each other
Wages earned and lessons learned
But I'm right where you left me

Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, "What a sad sight," I
I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective, but I sat and stared
Right where you left me

You left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me, you left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever

Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen
Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
How it was supposed to be
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion
Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
And you're sitting in front of me

At the restaurant when I was still the one you want
Cross-legged in the dim light
Everything was just right, I
I could feel the mascara run
You told me that you met someone
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on

Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, "What a sad sight," I
I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
I'm sure that you got a wife out there
Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware
'Cause I'm right where
I cause no harm
Mind my business
If our love died young
I can't bear witness
And it's been so long
But if you ever think you got it wrong

I'm right where
You left me
You left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me
You left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever

"it's time to go"

When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab
Or that moment again he's insisting that friends
Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not
In fact what she seemed, not a twin from your dreams
She's a crook who was caught

That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

Twenty years at your job
Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse

That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing

Fifteen years, fifteen million tears
Begging 'til my knees bled
I gave it my all, he gave me nothing at all
Then wondered why I left
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
Praying to his greed
He's got my past frozen behind glass
But I've got me

That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul
I know when it's time to go

Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
That will find you the right thing
And you know in your soul
You know in your soul
When it's time to go
You know, you know, you know, you know
When it's time to go
So then you go
Then you go
You just go

"Fearless (Taylor's Version)"

There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly making me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this one-horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Oh, oh

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
Oh, yeah

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

Oh, oh
Oh-oh, yeah

"Fifteen (Taylor's Version)"

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

"Love Story (Taylor's Version)"

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go," and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"

Oh, oh

And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

"Hey Stephen (Taylor's Version)"

Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah

Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving
I think you and I should stay the same

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you (Ha-ha-ha)

I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Ah-uh, myself
Mmm-mm, I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Oh-oh-oh
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm

"White Horse (Taylor's Version)"

Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

Maybe I was nave, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now

"You Belong With Me (Taylor's Version)"

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me, you belong with me

Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby
You belong with me, you belong with me

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby
You belong with me, you belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me

"Breathe (Taylor's Version)"
(feat. Colbie Caillat)

[Taylor Swift]
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm

[Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
And nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh

I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Mmm)
I'm sorry, (Yeah, yeah) I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Ooh, ooh)
I'm sorry

"Tell Me Why (Taylor's Version)"

I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
Tell me why

Well, you could write a book on
How to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm tryin' to say, oh

I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
Tell me why

Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
Feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
Tell me why (Why)
Tell me why (Oh)

I take a step back, I let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know

"You're Not Sorry (Taylor's Version)"

All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh

You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now you're asking me to listen
'Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh

You had me crawling for you, honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Woah, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no

"The Way I Loved You (Taylor's Version)"

He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, "You look beautiful tonight."
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2 AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2 AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2 AM and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh

Whoa, whoa, oh-oh, oh
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

"Forever & Always (Taylor's Version)"

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always."
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always."

Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always."
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always."
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything

'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always."
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said, "Forever and always."
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always."
You didn't mean it baby
You said, "Forever and always," yeah

"The Best Day (Taylor's Version)"

I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today

"Change (Taylor's Version)"

Well, it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this

'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

Tonight, we'll stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now
When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah

"Jump Then Fall (Taylor's Version)"

I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall

Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it o-over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me

'Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall

The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

Whoa oh, I need you, baby
Don't be afraid, please
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall, baby
Jump then fall into me, into me

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I shine
And every time you're here
Baby, I'll show you, I'll show you
You can jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah

"Untouchable (Taylor's Version)"

Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you

Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway

But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

I'm caught up in you
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, come on
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
And in the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, oh, come on, come on
Come on, come on, oh, oh, oh

It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
They're spelling out your name, oh

"Forever & Always (Piano Version) (Taylor's Version)"

And we caught onto something
I hold on to the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore

Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all

And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said, "Forever and always"

Was I out of line

You didn't mean it baby
You said, "Forever and always," yeah

"Come In With The Rain (Taylor's Version)"

I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore

Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start

Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I've watched you so long, screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore

"Superstar (Taylor's Version)"

This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't keep my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

Morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

Sweet, sweet superstar
Superstar

"The Other Side Of The Door (Taylor's Version)"

In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignorin' words that you were sayin'
Tryna make me stay
I said, "This time I've had enough"
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up

'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone
Goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone
I keep goin' back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread

Oh, babe, if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah

I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, "There's nothing you can say
To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it"
But what I mean is

I said, "Leave," but, baby, all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you

"Today Was A Fairytale (Taylor's Version)"

Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around

Can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah

But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale

"You All Over Me (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"
(feat. Maren Morris)

[Taylor Swift]
Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones, on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath
Reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off
It's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been
Reminds me of me

[Taylor Swift and Maren Morris]
I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long
And wasted time, lost tears
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your "Don't you wish you had me" grin
Well, I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then

And I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long
And wasted time, lost tears
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see, that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
I've still got you all over me
Still got you all over me

"Mr. Perfectly Fine (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

Mr. "Perfect face"
Mr. "Here to stay"
Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"
Everything was right
Mr. "I've been waiting for you all my life"
Mr. "Every single day until the end, I will be by your side"

But that was when I got to know Mr. "Change of heart"
Mr. "Leaves me all alone," I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay

Hello Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breaking mine
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Hello Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss "Misery" since your goodbye
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"

Mr. "Never told me why"
Mr. "Never had to see me cry"
Mr. "Insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy"
He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even heard my name
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same

'Cause I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl
I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her
And I never got past what you put me through
But it's wonderful to see that it never fazed you

Hello Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breakin' mine
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Hello Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss "Misery" since your goodbye
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"

So dignified in your well-pressed suit
So strategized, all the eyes on you
Sashay away to your seat
It's the best seat, in the best room
Oh, he's so smug, Mr. "Always wins"
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything

And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame
'Cause I was Miss "Here to stay"
Now I'm Miss "Gonna be alright someday"
And someday maybe you'll miss me
But by then, you'll be Mr. "Too late"

Goodbye Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breakin' mine
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Goodbye Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss "Misery" for the last time
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"
You're perfectly fine
Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"
You said you'd never go away

"We Were Happy (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night and we were happy
I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it
And we were happy

When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy

When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
We were happy

Oh, I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy, we were happy

When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
And we were happy
Yeah, we were happy
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We were happy

"That's When (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"
(feat. Keith Urban)

[Taylor Swift]
You said, "I know"
When I said, "I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this"
You watched me go
And I knew my
Words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back
And I said, "When can I-I-I come back"

[Taylor Swift and Keith Urban]
And you said that's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when
Mm, mm

I said, "I know"
When you said, "I did you wrong
Made mistakes
And put you through all of this" (through all of this)
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said, "Leave those all in our past"
And you said, "When can I-I-I come back"

And I said, that's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when"

[Taylor Swift]
And you said, "Honestly
When you were gone
Did you ever think of me"
And I said

[Taylor Swift with Keith Urban]
"That's when, when I woke up in the morning
That's when, it was sunny or storming
Laughing when I was crying
And that's when, you were waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby, that's when"

That's when, when I wake up in the morning (Yeah)
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
When I'm laughing, when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
(That when I miss you, that's when I want you)
That's when, when I see your face
That's when I love you, that's when

"Don't You (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere
It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare
I heard she's nothin' like me
I'm sure she'll make you happy

But don't you
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you

Ah, ah, ah, ah

Sometimes I really wish that I could hate you
I've tried, but that's just somethin' I can't do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldn't do this

But don't you
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you

So I walk outta here tonight
Try to go on with my life
And you can say, "We're still friends"
I don't wanna pretend
So if I see you again

Don't you (Don't you)
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you (Don't you), say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't (You don't), know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Don't you, ah, ah, ah

"Bye Bye Baby (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
'Cause I, I still love you but I can't

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, baby

The picture frame is empty
On the dresser, vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation
I was so sure of everything
Everything I thought we'd always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye, bye, baby

And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Oh, you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, baby

"State Of Grace (Taylor's Version)"

I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room, and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same, oh
And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same
(So you were never a saint, and I loved in shades of wrong)
(We learn to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts)
(But this love is brave and wild)

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

"Red (Taylor's Version)"

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright, just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
But loving him was red
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)

Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
Oh, red (Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
Burning red (Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red

(Red, red, red red, red, red)
Yeah, yeah, red
(Red, red, red red, red, red)
Burning red (Red, red, red red, red, red)
(Red, red, red red, red, red)

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (Red, red, red red, red, red)
Comes back to me (Red, red, red red, red, red), burning red
(Red, red, red red, red, red) Yeah, yeah
(Red, red, red red, red, red)

His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street

"Treacherous (Taylor's Version)"

Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
All we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will
Get you a, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind and I just
Think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will
Get you a, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind and I just
Think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

"I Knew You Were Trouble (Taylor's Version)"

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey

I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh-oh (Yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Trouble)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything
Yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there)
So shame on me now (Knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Trouble)
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

"All Too Well (Taylor's Version)"

I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now

Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all, oh-oh-oh

'Cause there we are again on that
Little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were
Looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
You taught me about your past, thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Till you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well

And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

"22 (Taylor's Version)"

It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Ah, ah, ah, ah
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Ah ah, ah, ah
Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines, it's time
Ah, ah

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
22
22

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids ("Who is Taylor Swift anyway")
Ah ah, ah ah
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping, yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks, it's time
Ah, ah

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if (Alright)
We just keep dancing like we're
22
22 (I don't know about you)
22
22

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me (You don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're 22
22
22 (Dancing like)
22
22

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

"I Almost Do (Taylor's Version)"

I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city and I bet
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost do, I almost do

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It's probably better off this way
And I confess, baby
In my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I'd want to try again with you
And I almost do

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost do, I almost do

I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city and I hope
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me

"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together (Taylor's Version)"

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough", 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space, what
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"

Ooh, we called it off again last night but
Ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight but
Ooh, this time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say never say never

So he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you"
And I'm like, I'm just, I mean this is exhausting you know
Like we are never getting back together
Like, ever

(No)
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

(We)
No
(Getting back together)
(We)
(Getting back together)
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

"Stay Stay Stay (Taylor's Version)"

I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away but you stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, "Ok, let's talk"
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you
All the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you
For my whole life

Stay
And I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

That's so fun

"The Last Time (Taylor's Version)"
(feat. Gary Lightbody)

I find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I'm not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

You find yourself at my door
And just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

And right before your eyes
I'm aching
No past, nowhere to hide
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
This is the last time I say it's been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

This is the last time I'm asking you this
(This is the last time I'm asking you this)
Put my name at the top of your list
(Put my name at the top of your list)
This is the last time I'm asking you why
(This is the last time I'm asking you why)
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
(You break my heart)
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this

"Holy Ground (Taylor's Version)"

I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone
And Lord it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

And darling it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We block the noise with the sound of, "I need you"
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

"Sad Beautiful Tragic (Taylor's Version)"

Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
And we both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons
And darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair (Whoa, oh, whoa, oh)

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen
Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back
A beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful

What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

"The Lucky One (Taylor's Version)"

New to town with a made up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen

Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one
Oh, oh, oh

Now, it's big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

'Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh

"Everything Has Changed (Taylor's Version)"
(feat. Ed Sheeran)

(You good to go)

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

All I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

All I know is we said, "Hello"
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

"Starlight (Taylor's Version)"

I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picks me up late one night
Out the window, we were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, "Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way"
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight
Don't you dream impossible things"

Like, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh-ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh-ooh, dancing with me
Ooh-ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight (Ooh, hoo, hoo)
Like we dream impossible dreams (Ooh, hoo, hoo)

Don't you see the starlight, starlight (Ooh, hoo, hoo)
Don't you dream impossible things

"Begin Again (Taylor's Version)"

Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song, but I do, I do

I walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a caf, I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy, but I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a caf, I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a caf, I watched it begin again

But on a Wednesday in a caf, I watched it begin again

"The Moment I Knew (Taylor's Version)"

You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that "Baby, I'm right here" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy

Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
"He said he'd be here"

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing (Missing)
And that was the moment I knew

What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show

You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
"Happy birthday to you"
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

You called me later
And said, "I'm sorry I didn't make it"
And I said, "I'm sorry, too"
And that was the moment I knew

"Come Back...Be Here (Taylor's Version)"

You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant

Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

This is falling in love in the cruellest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
But you're in London, and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around

This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

Oh-oh, oh-oh
I don't wanna miss you like this
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

"Girl At Home (Taylor's Version)"

Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that

I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This, I have previously learned

So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

I just wanna make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her

So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

Oh-oh
Oh-oh

Call a cab, lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab, lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned

Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn't once been just like her

"State Of Grace (Acoustic Version) (Taylor's Version)"

I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time

And I never
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

I never
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same, oh

Oh, I never
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

"Ronan (Taylor's Version)"

I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me, waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

"Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years"

I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming "Why"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

"Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray, we'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years"

What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you

Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back

"Nothing New (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"
(feat. Phoebe Bridgers)

They tell you while you're young
"Girls, go out and have your fun"
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly
When you're soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say, "She looks like she's been through it"
Lord, what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty

I've had too much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new

How long will it be cute, all this crying in my room
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention
And someone else lights up the room
People love an ingnue

I've had too much to drink tonight
How did I go from growing up to breaking down
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new

I know someday I'm gonna meet her
It's a fever dream
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me
I'll say I'm happy for her then I'll cry myself to sleep
Oh woah, oh woah, oh, oh

I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out
I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
And I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two
And will you still want me, will you still want me
Will you still want me when I'm nothing new

"Message In A Bottle (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

I know that you like me
And it's kinda frightening
Standing here waiting, waiting
And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes
Tongue tied
But, now, you're so far away and I'm down
Feeling like a face in the crowd
I'm reaching for you, terrified

'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
And I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you

These days I'm restless
Workdays are endless
Look how you made me, made me
But time moves faster
Replaying your laughter
Disaster

'Cause, now, you're so far away and I'm down
Feeling like a face in the crowd
I'm reaching for you, terrified

'Cause you could be the one that I love
And I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
And I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you

How is it in London (London)
Where were you while I'm wondering (Wondering)
If I'll ever see you again

You could be the one that I love
And, now, I'm standing here hoping it gets to you

'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
And I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you

You could be the one that I love
You could be the one that I love
My love
And, now, I'm standing here hoping this gets to you

"I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"
(feat. Chris Stapleton)

3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh

Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of

But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills

But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

Mr. Superior Thinkin'
Do you have all the space that you need
I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy
And I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

Oh, block it all out
The voices so loud, sayin'
"Why did you let her go"
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that you're lookin' for
Is the love that you had

Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me

But now that we're done and it's over
I bet it's hard to believe
That it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And, yeah, I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me when you're out
At your cool indie music concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch
I bet you think about me when you say
"Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me"
I bet you think about me

"Forever Winter (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
He says, "Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away"
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity
I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 3 A.M., pacing
He says, "It's not just a phase I'm in"
My voice comes out begging

All this time I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

He seems fine most of the time
Forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony
When the lights go out, it's hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead
I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 5 A.M., wasted
Long gone, not even listening
My voice comes out screaming

All this time I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

If I was standing there in your apartment
I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it
I'd say I love you even at your darkest and
Please don't go

I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you werent around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

I'll be your summer sun forever
At 3 A.M., pacing
All this time I didn't know
At 5 A.M., wasted
I'd be in pieces on the floor
Forever winter if you go

He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
I say, "Believe in one thing, I won't go away"

"Run (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"
(feat. Ed Sheeran)

One, two, three, four

Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around
We shouldn't be in this town
And my so-called friends, they don't know
I'd drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
There's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote
"I'll wait for you"
There's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame
Take it with you

And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run

So you laugh like a child
And I'll sing like no one cares
No one to be, no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
There's a heart on your sleeve
I'll take it when I leave
And hold it for you

And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all
We can go like they're trying to chase us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run

There's been this hole in my heart
This thing was a shot in the dark
Say you'll never let 'em tear us apart
And I'll hold onto you while we run (And we run, and we run, and we run)

Like you'd run from the law (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Darling, let's run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Run from it all (And we run, and we run, and we run)
We can go where our eyes can take us (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Go where no one else is, run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, and we'll run

"The Very First Night (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

And so it goes
Every weekend, this same party
I never go alone and I don't seem brokenhearted
My friends all say they know everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you
'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't riding in the car when we both fell
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you

I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

And so it was
We never saw it coming
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back then we didn't know we were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo, then we broke each other's hearts
But don't forget about the night out in LA
Danced in the kitchen, chased me down through the hallway
No one knows about the words that we whispered
No one knows how much I miss you

I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you

I remember the night at the hotel
I was riding in the car when we both fell
I'm the one on the phone as you whisper
"Do you know how much I miss you"
I wish that we could go back in time
And I'd say to you
"I miss you like it was the very first night"

I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you

"All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "fuck the patriarchy"
Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come
And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes
"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue
Just between us, did the love affair maim you, too
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well
Just between us, do you remember it all too well
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it

"A Message From Taylor"

Musically and lyrically, Red resembled a heart-broken person
It was all over the place
A fractured mosaic of feelings that somehow all fit together in the end
Happy, free, confused, lonely, devastated, euphoric, wild
And tortured by memories past
These are the original thirty songs that were meant for Red
I love you guys

"Lavender Haze"

Meet me at midnight
Ooh ooh ooh whoa

Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia
I've been under scrutiny (Yeah, oh yeah)
You handle it beautifully (Yeah, oh yeah)
All this shit is new to me (Yeah, oh yeah)

I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s' shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
Ooh ooh ooh whoa

All they keep asking me
(All they keep asking me)
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see
(Only kinda girl they see)
Is a one-night or a wife
I find it dizzying (Yeah, oh yeah)
They're bringing up my history (Yeah, oh yeah)
But you weren't even listening (Yeah, oh yeah)

I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s' shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
That lavender haze

Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
(Get it off my desk)

Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk

I feel (I feel) the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal (No deal)
The 1950s' shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

Ooh ooh ooh whoa
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
That lavender haze
I just wanna stay
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

"Maroon"

When the morning came, we
Were cleaning incense off your
Vinyl shelf 'cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
"How'd we end up on the floor anyway"
You say
"Your roommate's cheap-ass screw top ros
That's how"
I see you every day now

And I chose you
The one I was dancing with in New York
No shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

When the silence came, we
Were shaking blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses
That's us
I feel you, no matter what
The rubies that I gave up

And I lost you
The one I was dancing with in New York
No shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was maroon
The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fuckin' legacy, legacy
(It was maroon)
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fuckin' legacy to leave

The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet
It was maroon
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

It was maroon
It was maroon

"Anti-Hero"

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism
I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
"She's laughing up at us from Hell"

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees

It's me, hi (Hi), I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

"Snow On The Beach"
(feat. Lana Del Rey)

One night a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you

And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, oh

This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched 'aurora borealis green'
I've never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it till you make it
Till you do
Till it's true

Now it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, oh

I can't speak, afraid to jinx it
I don't even dare to wish it
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
Now I'm all for you like Janet
Can this be a real thing, can it

Are we falling like
Snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around

Like snow on the beach
(It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)
Like snow on the beach
(It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)
(It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)
(Down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)

"You're On Your Own, Kid"

Summer went away
Still the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently
He's gonna notice me
It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway

I hear it in your voice
You're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town
I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

I see the great escape
So long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed
Writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid

You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

"Midnight Rain"

Rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice

He was sunshine
I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away

'Cause he was sunshine
I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

Rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except when I'm on TV
I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this
Midnights like this

"Question..."

(I remember)

Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices
We had one thing going on
I swear that it was something
'Cause I don't remember who I was before you
Painted all my nights
A color I have searched for since
But one thing after another
Fuckin' situations, circumstances
Miscommunications and I
Have to say
By the way
I just may like some explanations

Can I ask you a question
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too
Then what did you do
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much
Do you wish you could still touch her
It's just a question

Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize out of time
She was on your mind
With some dickhead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on something
It was one drink after another
Fuckin' politics and gender roles
And you're not sure and I don't know
Got swept away in the gray
I just may like to have a conversation

Can I ask you a question
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too
Then what did you do
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much
Do you wish you could still touch her
It's just a question

Does it feel like everything's just like second best after that meteor strike
And what's that that I heard, that you're still with her
That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable
And right
But tonight

Can I ask you a question (Can I ask you a question)
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room (In a crowded room)
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you (You, making fun of you)
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too
Then what did you do
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much
Do you wish you could still touch her
It's just a question

"Vigilante Shit"

Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them
Sometimes I wonder which one will be your last lie
They say looks can kill and I might try
I don't dress for women
I don't dress for men
Lately I've been dressing for revenge

I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately I've been dressing for revenge

She needed cold hard proof so I gave her some
She had the envelope, where you think she got it from
Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife
And she looks so pretty
Driving in your Benz
Lately she's been dressing for revenge

She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
She don't dress for friends
Lately she's been dressing for revenge

Ladies always rise above
Ladies know what people want
Someone sweet and kind and fun
The lady simply had enough
While he was doing lines
And crossing all of mine
Someone told his white collar crimes to the FBI
And I don't dress for villains
Or for innocents
I'm on my vigilante shit again

I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately I've been dressing for revenge

"Bejeweled"

Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walking all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Putting someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way
I'm going out tonight

Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, "Do you have a man"
I could still say, "I don't remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real
I polish up real nice
Nice

Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl
Too good of a girl
Did all the extra credit then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world
Have you heard
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you
But I miss sparkling

(Nice) Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, "Do you have a man"
I could still say, "I don't remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real
I polish up real nice
Nice

Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my aura's moonstone
Just 'cause he was high
And we're dancing all night
And you can try
To change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do
A diamond's gotta shine

Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, "Do you have a man"
I could still say, "I don't remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real (Nice)
I polish up real nice

And we're dancing all night
And you can try
To change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do
What's a girl gonna do
I polish up nice
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer

"Labyrinth"

It only hurts this much right now
Was what I was thinking the whole time
Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out
I'll be getting over you my whole life
You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
It can't last

Uh oh, I'm falling in love
Oh no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around

It only feels this raw right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
Break up, break free, break through, break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile
You know how much I hate
That everybody just expects me to bounce back
Just like that

Uh oh, I'm falling in love
Oh no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around

Uh oh, I'm falling in love
Oh no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around

Uh oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
Oh no, I'm falling in love again (falling in love again)
Oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around

Uh oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
Oh no, I'm falling in love again (falling in love again)
Oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around

(You know how much I hate it)
(You know how much I hate it)
(You know how much I hate it)

"Karma"

You're talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around

And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Spiderboy, king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price
It's coming back around

And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here
(I'm still here, I'm still here)

'Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma's gonna track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me

'Cause karma is my boyfriend (Karma is my boyfriend)
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (Weekend)
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god (Ah)
Uh-huh, mm
Karma's a relaxing thought

"Sweet Nothing"

I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes
Ooh
Ooh

They said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings

Outside, they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
Sweet nothing

On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, "What a mind"
This happens all the time
Ooh
Ooh

'Cause they said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings

Outside they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
Nothing

Industry disrupters and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters
Out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore
"You should be doing more"
To you I can admit
That I'm just too soft for all of it
Ooh

They said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings

Outside, they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
Sweet nothing

They said the end is coming (They said the end is coming)
Everyone's up to something (Everyone's up to something)
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings

Outside, they're push and shoving (Outside, they're push and shoving)
You're in the kitchen humming (You're in the kitchen humming)
All that you ever wanted from me was
Sweet nothing

"Mastermind"

Once upon a time, the planets and the fates and all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room at the same time
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose

What if I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me, nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork and then just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind
And now you're mine
It was all by design
'Cause I'm a mastermind

You see all the wisest women had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be the pawn in every lover's game
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails

What if I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me, I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork and then just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind
And now you're mine
It was all my design
'Cause I'm a mastermind

No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless
This is the first time I've felt the need to confess
And I swear
I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian 'cause I care

So I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me, nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork and then saw a wide smirk
On your face, you knew the entire time
You knew that I'm a mastermind
And now you're mine
Yeah, all you did was smile
'Cause I'm a mastermind

"Hits Different"

I washed my hands of us at the club
You made a mess of me
I pictured you with other girls in love
Then threw up on the street
Like waiting for a bus that never shows
You just start walkin' on
They say that if it's right, you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different 'cause it's you

('Cause it's you)

I used to switch out these Kens, I'd just ghost
Rip the band-aid off and skip town like an asshole outlaw
Freedom felt like summer then on the coast
Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings
And I never don't cry (And I never don't cry) at the bar
Yeah, my sadness is contagious (My sadness is contagious)
I slur your name 'til someone puts me in a car
I stopped receiving invitations

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different 'cause it's you

('Cause it's you)

I find the artifacts, cried over a hat
Cursed the space that I needed
I trace the evidence, make it make some sense
Why the wound is still bleedin'
You were the one that I loved
Don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough
A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes
This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy
Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief
In the good in the world, you once believed in me
And I felt you and I held you for a while
Bet I could still melt your world
Argumentative, antithetical dream girl

I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway
Is that your key in the door
Is it okay Is it you
Or have they come to take me away
To take me away

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different (It hits different)
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different (It hits different)
It hits different 'cause it's you

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
'Cause it's you
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different (Yeah)
It hits different 'cause it's you

You've got no reason to be afraid

You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

"Sweet Nothing (Piano Remix)"

I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly, a pebble
That we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes
Ooh, ooh

They said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I found myself a-running home to your sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing

On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, "What a mind"
This happens all the time
Ooh, ooh

'Cause they said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I found myself a-running home to your sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was nothing

Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore, "You should be doing more"
To you, I can't admit that I'm just too soft for all of it
Ooh

They said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I found myself a-running home to your sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing
They said the end is coming
(They said the end is coming)
Everyone's up to something
(Everyone's up to something)
I found myself a-running home to your sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shoving
(Outside they're push and shoving)
You're in the kitchen humming
(You're in the kitchen humming)
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing

"Meet Me At Midnight"

Hey Apple Music, this is Taylor Swift
Midnights tells the stories of thirteen sleepless nights scattered throughout my life
I hope you like it and, wherever you are, you'll meet me at midnight

"The Great War"

My knuckles were bruised like violets
Sucker punching walls
Cursed you as I sleep talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down
Took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur

All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember, uh-huh
Tears on the letter, I vowed
Not to cry anymore
If we survived the Great War

You drew up some good faith treaties
I drew curtains closed
Drank my poison all alone
You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire
You were playing with fire
And maybe it's the past that's talking
Screaming from the crypt
Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it

All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the bombs were closer
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember, uh-huh
The burning embers, I vowed
Not to fight anymore
If we survived the Great War
Uh-huh, uh-huh

It turned into something bigger
Somewhere in the haze
Got a sense I'd been betrayed
Your finger on my hairpin triggers
Soldier down on that icy ground
Looked up at me with honor and truth
Broken and blue
So I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought I'd lost you

We can plant a memory garden
Say a solemn prayer
Place a poppy in my hair
There's no morning glory
It was war, it wasn't fair
And we will never go back to that

Bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the worst was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember, uh-huh
We're burned for better, I vowed
I would always be yours
'Cause we survived the Great War
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I will always be yours
'Cause we survived the Great War
Uh-huh
I vowed I will always be yours

"Bigger Than The Whole Sky"

No words appear before me in the aftermath
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears
Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness
'Cause it's all over now, all out to sea

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you
What could've been, would've been you

Did some bird flap its wings over in Asia
Did some force take you because I didn't pray
Every single thing to come has turned into ashes
'Cause it's all over, it's not meant to be
So I'll say words I don't believe

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you

What could've been, would've been you
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you
What could've been, would've been you
(What could've been, would've been you)

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you

"Paris"

"Your ex-friend's sister
Met someone at a club and he kissed her
Turns out, it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago
Some wannabe -lister
And all the outfits were terrible
2003 unbearable
Did you see the photos"
No, I didn't, but thanks, though

I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
Stumbled down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne
I was taken by the view

Like we were in Paris
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else

Privacy sign on the door
And on my page and on the whole world
Romance is not dead if you keep it just yours
Levitate above all the messes made
Sit quiet by my side in the shade
And not the kind that's thrown
I mean, the kind under where a tree has grown

I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
Stumbled down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne
I was taken by the view

Like we were in Paris, oh
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else

I wanna brainwash you
Into loving me forever
I wanna transport you
To somewhere the culture's clever
Confess my truth
In swooping, sloping, cursive letters
Let the only flashing lights be the tower at midnight
In my mind

We drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
In an alleyway, drinking champagne

'Cause we were in Paris
Yes, we were somewhere else
My love, we were in Paris
Yes, we were somewhere else

"High Infidelity"

Lock broken
Slur spoken
Wound open
Game token
I didn't know you were keeping count
Rain soaking
Blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
I didn't know you were keeping count

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it

Do you really want to know where I was April 29th
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes

Storm coming
Good husband
Bad omen
Dragged my feet right down the aisle
At the house lonely
Good money
I'd pay, if you'd just know me
Seemed like the right thing at the time

You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough
Do you really want to know where I was April 29th
Do I really have to tell you how he brought me back to life

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it

High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it

Do you really want to know where I was April 29th
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes
You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret meeting me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it

High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it

Oh, there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
And it's never enough, it's never enough

Lock broken
Slur spoken
Wound open
Game token
I didn't know you were keeping count
Rain soaking
Blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
I didn't know you were keeping count
But, oh, you were keeping count

"Glitch"

We were supposed to be just friends
You don't live in my part of town but maybe I'll see you out some weekend
Depending on what kind of mood and situation-ship I'm in
And what's in my system

I think there's been a glitch, ah-yeah
Five seconds later I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, ah-yeah
And I'm not even sorry
Nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch, ah-yeah

I was supposed to sweat you out
In search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone else's playground
But it's been 2,190 days of our love blackout
(Our love is blacking out)
The system's breaking down
(The system's breaking down)

I think there's been a glitch, ah-yeah
Five seconds later I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, ah-yeah
And I'm not even sorry
Nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch, ah-yeah

A brief interruption
A slight malfunction
I'd go back to wanting
Dudes who give nothing
I thought we had no chance
And that's romance
Let's dance

Glitch, ah-yeah
Five seconds later I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, ah-yeah
And I'm not even sorry
Nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch

"Would've, Could've, Should've"

If you would've blinked, then I would've
Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison you could've
Spit me out at the first chance
If I was some paint, did it splatter
On a promising grown man
And if I was a child, did it matter
If you got to wash your hands
Oh, all I used to do was pray
Would've, could've, should've
If you'd never looked my way

I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen, and the god's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know
I wish you'd left me wondering

If you never touched me I would've
Gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed then they could've
Never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom
I could've gone on as I was
But, lord, you made me feel important
And then you tried to erase us
Oh, you're a crisis of my faith
Would've, could've, should've
If I'd only played it safe

I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen, and the god's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know
I wish you'd left me wondering

God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time

If clarity's in death, then why won't this die
Years of tearing down our banners, you and I
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts
Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first

And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen, and the god's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know
I wish you'd left me wondering

God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time

Oh, god rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time

"Dear Reader"

Dear reader, if it feels like a trap
You're already in one
Dear reader, get out your map
Pick somewhere and just run
Dear reader, burn all the files
Desert all your past lives
And if you don't recognize yourself
That means you did it right

Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart (You should find another)

Dear reader, bend when you can
Snap when you have to
Dear reader, you don't have to answer
Just 'cause they asked you
(You should find another)
Dear reader, the greatest of luxuries is your secrets
Dear reader, when you aim at the devil
Make sure you don't miss

Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart

So I wander through these nights
I prefer hiding in plain sight
My fourth drink in my hand
These desperate prayers of a cursed man
Spilling out to you for free
But darling, darling, please
You wouldn't take my word for it if you knew who was talking
If you knew where I was walking
To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there
Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care
No one sees when you lose when you're playing solitaire

You should find another guiding light, guiding light
But I shine so bright
You should find another guiding light, guiding light
But I shine so bright
You should find another, you should find another (Guiding light)
Find another, you should find another
You should find another

"Snow On The Beach (Remix)"
(feat. Lana Del Rey)

One night a few moons ago I
Saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you

And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah

This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched 'aurora borealis green'
I've never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it
'Til you do
'Til it's true

Now it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah

I can't speak, afraid to jinx it
I, can't
I don't even dare to wish it
I, don't
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
Now I'm all for you like Janet
Can this be a real thing, can it

Are we falling like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah
It's coming down, no sound, it's all around

Like snow on the beach
Like snow, like snow, ah yeah

"Karma (Remix)"
(feat. Ice Spice)

Karma is that girl like (Grah)

You're talking shit
For the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal
But you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare
You'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a God
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not
Sweet like honey
Karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Karma is ya checks 'boutta bounce (Damn)
Karma is a fire in ya house (Grah)
And she 'boutta pop up unannounced (Like)
And she never leaving you alone (Damn)
Watch her put ya opps on a throne (Damn)
Got you waving pretty white flags
Feenin' for that cash
Thinking it'll save ya
Now you switching up ya behavior
It's okay, baby
You ain't gotta worry, karma never gets lazy
So I keep my head up, my bread up, I won't let up (Never)
Promise that you'll never endeavor with none lesser (Ever, ever)
I be draggin' that wagon
Karma is a beauty winning that pageant (Grah)

'Cause karma is my boyfriend (Damn)
Karma is a God
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not
Sweet like honey
Karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that (Grah)

Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade but I'm still here
I'm still here
I'm still here

'Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
And karma's gonna track you down
Step by step from town to town
Sweet like justice
Karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit (Facts)
Karma is the guy on the screen coming straight home to me

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a God
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not
Sweet like honey
Karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a God
Karma is my bestie
Karma's a relaxing thought...
Karma's gonna hold you down

"You're Losing Me (From The Vault)"

You say, "I don't understand" and I say, "I know you don't"
We thought a cure would come through in time, now, I fear it won't
Remember lookin' at this room, we loved it 'cause of the light
Now, I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time

Do I throw out everything we built or keep it
I'm getting tired even for a phoenix
Always risin' from the ashes
Mendin' all her gashes
You might just have dealt the final blow

Stop, you're losing me
Stop, you're losing me
Stop, you're losing me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore... for you
'Cause you're losing me

Every mornin' I glared at you with storms in my eyes
How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin'
I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick
My face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick

And the air is thick with loss and indecision
I know my pain is such an imposition
Now, you're running down the hallway
And you know what they all say
"You don't know what you got until it's gone"

Stop, you're losing me
Stop, you're losing me
Stop, you're losing me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore... for you
'Cause you're losing me
'Cause you're losing me
Stop (Stay) 'cause you're losing me

My heart won't start anymore (Stop 'cause you're losing me)
My heart won't start anymore (Stop 'cause you're losing me)

How long could we be a sad song
'Til we were too far gone to bring back to life
I gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy
And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier
Fighting in only your army, frontlines, don't you ignore me
I'm the best thing at this party (You're losing me)
And I wouldn't marry me either
A pathological people pleaser
Who only wanted you to see her
And I'm fading, thinkin'
"Do something, babe, say something" (Say something)
"Lose something, babe, risk something" (You're losing me)
"Choose something, babe, I got nothing" (I got nothing)
"To believe, unless you're choosing me"

You're losing me
Stop (Stop, stop), you're losing me
Stop (Stop, stop), you're losing me
I can't find a pulse, my heart won't start anymore

"Mine (Taylor's Version)"

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

You were in college working part-time, waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say, "Can you believe it"
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Oh-oh, oh

And I remember that fight, 230AM
As everything was slippin' right out of our hands
I ran out cryin' and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone"

You said, "I remember how it felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine"

Hold on and make it last
Hold on, never turn back
(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Yes, yes, do you believe it (Hold on)
Yes, yes, we're gonna make it now (Hold on, yeah)
Yes, yes, and I can see it (Hold on)
Yes, yes, I can see it now (See it now, see it now)

"Sparks Fly (Taylor's Version)"

The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of

Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really somethin'
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you, I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would

Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show

Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly

"Back To December (Taylor's Version)"

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life Tell me, how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughin' from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

All the time

"Speak Now (Taylor's Version)"

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don't you

Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
Don't say yes, run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow)
Your time is running out
And they said, "Speak now"

Ooh (Run away now), la
Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh

I hear the preacher say
"Speak now or forever hold your peace"
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only lookin' at you

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha

So, don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
They said, "Speak now"
And you say, "Let's run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when I'm out
Of my tux, at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow)
So glad you were around
When they said, 'Speak now'"

"Dear John (Taylor's Version)"

Long were the nights
When my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Prayin' the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losin' my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back to turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you change the rules every day
Wonderin' which version of you
I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up
And this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda known

Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said
"Run as fast as you can"

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by
Your dark, twisted games when I loved you so
I shoulda known

You are an expert at "Sorry" and keepin' lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town
Oh

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You shoulda known

You shoulda known
Don't you think I was too young
You shoulda known

"Mean (Taylor's Version)"

You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man

Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean

You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big, loud opinion but nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumblin' on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean

All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic
And alone in life, and mean
And mean, and mean, and mean

But someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean

"The Story Of Us (Taylor's Version)"

I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now I'm searchin' the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Next chapter

How'd we end up this way
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and tryin' to look busy
And you're doin' your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losin' my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothin'
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love than fight

So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me Yeah
And I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'Cause we're goin' down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

The end

"Never Grow Up (Taylor's Version)"

Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favourite nightlight

To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up

Never grow up

You're in the car, on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots

But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's gettin' older, too
And don't lose the way that you dance around
In your PJs getting ready for school

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is, someday, gonna be gone

So, here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, I could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, it could still be simple
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you (Never grow up)
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please, try to never grow up

Oh, oh (Never grow up)
Don't you ever grow up
Oh (Never grow up)
Just never grow up

"Enchanted (Taylor's Version)"

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, "Have we met"
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
"Hey, it was enchanting to meet you"
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you (Oh-oh)

This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't have somebody waiting on you)
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you

"Better Than Revenge (Taylor's Version)"

Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say "Sabotage"
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
Woah, woah-ah-oh

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah (She deserved it)
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing (No)
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)
Come on, show me how much better you are
(So much better, yeah)
See, you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say "Sabotage"

"Innocent (Taylor's Version)"

I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night, you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, and life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up, too, ooh
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new, oh

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, and life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh
It's never too late to get it back

"Haunted (Taylor's Version)"

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

Oh, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead

Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I know, I know
I just know
You're not gone
You can't be gone, no

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
I can't go back, I'm haunted

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it

"Last Kiss (Taylor's Version)"

I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 158
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away
Away

I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, mm-hmm

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So, I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last

"Long Live (Taylor's Version)"

I said, "Remember this moment"
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives would
Never be the same
You held your head like a hero on a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

I said, "Remember this feeling"
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd"
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans
Got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, "Long live that look on your face"
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing, "Long live all the mountains we moved"
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

"Ours (Taylor's Version)"

Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
And you'll say

Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

"Superman (Taylor's Version)"

Tall, dark, and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yay
And you smile and say, "How are you"
And I'll say, "Just fine"
I always forget to tell you, I love you
I love you forever

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away, and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say
And you'll leave, got places to be, and I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away, but I never let you go
I'm love-struck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be

Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
'Cause I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
Forever and ever
And I watch superman fly away
I swear, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
When you come back down

"Electric Touch (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"
(feat. Patrick Stump)

Just breathe, just relax, it'll be okay
Just an hour 'til your car's in the driveway
Just the first time ever hangin' out with you tonight
I've got my money on things goin' badly
Got a history of stories ending sadly
Still hoping that the fire won't burn me
Just one time, just one time

All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm

I've been left in the rain lost and pining
I'm tryin' hard not to look like I'm trying
'Cause every time I tried hard for love, it fell apart (Woah)
I've gotten used to no one callin' my phone
I've grown accustomed to sleepin' alone
Still, I know that all it takes is to get it right
Just one time, just one time

All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm

I was thinking just one time (Just one time)
Maybe the stars align (Just one time)
And maybe I call you mine
And you won't need space
Or string me along while you decide
And just one time (Just one time)
Maybe the moment's right (The moment's right)
It's 805 and I see two headlights

All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch (Ooh)
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life (Life)
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm

"When Emma Falls in Love (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

When Emma falls in love, she paces the floor
Closes the blinds and locks the door
When Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom
Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong
She waits and takes her time
'Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain
When Emma falls in love, I know
That boy will never be the same

'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her

When Emma falls in love, it's all on her face
Hangs in the air like stars in outer space
When Emma falls in love, she disappears
And we all just laugh after seein' it all these years
When Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone
She takes on the pain and bears it on her own
'Cause when Emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps
She won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave

And she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her

Well, she's so New York when she's in L.A
She won't lose herself in love the way that I did
'Cause she'll call you out, she'll put you in your place
When Emma falls in love, I'm learning

Emma met a boy with eyes like a man
Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand
Now he'll be her shelter when it rains
Little does he know, his whole world's about to change

'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her

Yeah, between me and you, sometimes I wish I was her

"I Can See You (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

Uh-uh, uh, uh

You brush past me in the hallway
And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya
I've been watchin' you for ages
And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it

But what would you do if I went to touch you now
What would you do if they never found us out
What would you do if we never made a sound

'Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you

Uh-uh, uh, uh

And we kept everything professional
But something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like
They keep watchful eyes on us
So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet
You won't believe half the things I see inside my head
Wait 'til you see half the things that haven't happened yet

But what would you do if I went to touch you now
What would you do if they never found us out
What would you do if we never made a sound

'Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do Baby, if you only knew, oh, oh, oh
That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor
I could see you, make me want you even more
What would you do Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you

Uh-uh, uh, uh

I can see you in your suit and your necktie
Passed me a note saying, "Meet me tonight"
Then we kissed and you know I won't ever tell, yeah
And I could see you being my addiction
You can see me as a secret mission
Hide away and I will start behaving myself

Uh-uh, uh, uh
Oh-oh, oh, oh

I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do Baby, if you only knew, oh
That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor
I could see you, make me want you even more
What would you do Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you, oh, I can see you

Oh, I see you, I see you, baby
I see you
(Uh-uh, uh, uh) I see you, I see you, baby
Oh, baby

"Castles Crumbling (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"
(feat. Hayley Williams)

(Once, I had an empire)
(Once, I had an empire)
(Once, I had an empire)

Once, I had an empire in a golden age
I was held up so high, I used to be great
They used to cheer when they saw my face
Now, I fear I have fallen from grace

And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
You don't wanna know me now

Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty
Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me
Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far
I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart

Power went to my head and I couldn't stop
Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off
And here I sit alone behind walls of regret
Falling down like promises that I never kept

And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
You don't wanna know me now

My foes and friends watch my reign end
I don't know how it could've ended this way
Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor
People look at me like I'm a monster
Now they're screamin' at the palace's front gates
Used to chant my name
Now they're screaming that they hate me
Never wanted you to hate me

My castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down (Just let you down)
My castle's crumbling down
You don't wanna know me now, now

(Once, I had an empire)
(Once, I had an empire)
(Once, I had an empire)

"Foolish One (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

My cards are on the table, yours are in your hand
Chances are, tonight, you've already got plans
And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again
You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high
Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right
And I will block out these voices of reason in my head

And the voices say, "You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson"

Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down

You know how to keep me waitin'
I know how to act like I'm fine
Don't know what to call this situation
But I know I can't call you mine
And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof
'Cause when my head is on your shoulder
It starts thinkin' you'll come around
And maybe, someday, when we're older
This is something we'll laugh about
Over coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news

But then the voices say, "You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson"

Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out

Now I'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands
Sayin', "How could I not see the signs"
Oh, you haven't written me or called
But goodbye screamin' in the silence
And the voices in my head are tellin' me why
'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings
I'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring
And you will say you had the best of intentions
And maybe I will finally learn my lesson

Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out, oh-oh, oh, oh

La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, oh
La-la-la-la-la
Ain't never gonna come
Ooh, you will learn the hard way now
Foolish one
Sittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love
They ain't never gonna come
And thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out
Foolish one
The day is gonna come for your confessions of love
When all is said and done, he just wasn't the one
No, he just wasn't the one

"Timeless (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

Down the block, there's an antique shop
And something in my head said, "Stop," so I walked in
On the counter was a cardboard box
And the sign said, "Photos twenty-five cents each"
Black and white, saw a '30s bride
And school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house
The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
The kind you don't put down
And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain
But in those photos, I saw us instead
And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other
In another life, you still would've turned my head even if we'd met

On a crowded street in 1944
And you were headed off to fight in the war
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right
And you would've been fine
We would have been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless

I had to smile when it caught my eye
There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway
Holdin' hands on the way to a dance
And the date on the back said 1958
Which brought me back to the first time I saw you
Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop
I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round
At these precious things that time forgot
That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs
Story of a romance torn apart by fate
Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did
And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face

In the fifteen hundreds off in a foreign land
And I was forced to marry another man
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And run away and left it all behind
You still would've been mine
We would've been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless

Time breaks down your mind and body
Don't you let it touch your soul
It was like an age-old classic
The first time that you saw me
The story started when you said, "Hello"

In a crowded room a few short years ago
And sometimes there's no proof, you just know
You're always gonna be mine
We're gonna be
I'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' gray
We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made
And you'll say, "Oh my, we really were timeless"

We're gonna be timeless, timeless
You still would've been mine
We would've been
Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944
You still would've been mine
We would've been

Down the block, there's an antique shop
And somethin' in my head said, "Stop," so I walked in

"Welcome To New York (Taylor's Version)"

Walkin' through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat forever more
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat forever more
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me

Welcome to New York (New York)
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change
Anything, anything, anything

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me (Welcome to New York)

New soundtrack
It's been waiting for you (Welcome to New York)
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me (Welcome to New York)
So bright they never blind me (Welcome to New York)
Welcome to New York

"Blank Space (Taylor's Version)"

Nice to meet you, where you been
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play"

Aye, new money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me, so hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mmm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second-guessin' like
"Oh my God, who is she"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mmm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Ooh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mmm (Oh)
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mmm (Over)
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far (Ooh)
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar (Leave a nasty scar)
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

"Style (Taylor's Version)"

Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you (Heard from you)

I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home
Lights are off, he's takin' off his coat, mmm, yeah
I say, "I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl
Some other girl"

He says, "What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinking 'bout you and I"
I said, "I've been there too a few times"

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (A tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go)
We never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah, just take me home, oh (Out of style)

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

"Out Of The Woods (Taylor's Version)"

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember

And you took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet In the clear yet, good
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods

Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
And fall back together (Back together)

Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet In the clear yet, good
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you

Remember when you couldn't take the heat
I walked out, I said, "I'm setting you free"
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, oh
You were looking at me

Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods (I remember)
Are we in the clear yet Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet In the clear yet, good (Oh, I remember)
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods yet (Yeah)
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet Are we in the clear yet (Are we)
Are we in the clear yet In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet Are we in the clear yet (Yeah, yeah)
Are we in the clear yet In the clear yet, good
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet In the clear yet, good (Do you remember)

Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet In the clear yet, good

"All You Had To Do Was Stay (Taylor's Version)"

People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road (Stay)

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in (Stay)
Hey, now you say you want it
Back, now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Here you are now, callin' me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been pickin' up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye (Stay)

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in (Stay)
Hey, now you say you want it
Back, now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was (Stay, stay)

Let me remind you
This was what you wanted (You ended it)
You were all I wanted (But not like this)
Not like this, not like this
Oh, all you had to do was (Stay)

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in (Stay)
Hey, now you say you want it
Back, now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in (Stay)
Hey, now you say you want it
Back, now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy (All you had to do was stay)
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

"Shake It Off (Taylor's Version)"

I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make 'em stay
At least, that's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin' it's gonna be alright

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, I shake it off
Heart breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
I'm dancin' on my own (Dancin' on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (Moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop groovin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin' it's gonna be alright

Hey, hey, hey

About the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You coulda been gettin' down to this sick beat

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend, she's like
Oh, my God, but I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby, we can shake, shake, shake (Yeah, oh)

I-I-I shake it off, I shake it off
I-I-I shake it off, I shake it off

"I Wish You Would (Taylor's Version)"

It's 200 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now 'cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

It's 200 AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide, and it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for, and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish, I wish, I

200 AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide, but it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for, and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would
I, I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I wish you would

"Bad Blood (Taylor's Version)"

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you have to do this
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shiny Now it's all rusted

Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak Baby, I couldn't breathe and
Rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you think we'd be fine
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So, don't think it's in the past
These kinds of wounds they last, and they last

Now, did you think it all through
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't
So if you're coming my way
Just don't

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (Ghosts)
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts, mmm
If you love like that
Blood runs cold

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey (Bad blood, bad blood)
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (Think we can solve 'em)
You made a really deep cut

And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

"Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)"

He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request it is

Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ha, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' (Burnin') it (It) down (Down)
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow (Follow) you (You) around (Around)

Red lips and rosy cheeks

Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (Just pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ah-ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
Even if it's just in your
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha

"How You Get The Girl (Taylor's Version)"

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Stand there like a ghost, shaking from the rain, rain
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane-ane"
Say it's been a long six months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want

And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And then, you say

I want you for worse or for better

"This Love (Taylor's Version)"

Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

In silent screams, in wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh
Oh, oh

Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind for only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone

In losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh

(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love)

Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young, you just run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh
(This love) This love left a permanent mark
(This love) This love is glowing in the dark, oh
(This love) These hands had to let it go free, and
(This love) This love came back to me, oh

(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love)
(This love) This love came back to me, oh

"I Know Places (Taylor's Version)"

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling, dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They take their shots, but we're bulletproof (I, I know places)
And you know for me, it's always you (Hide, I know places)
In the dead of night, your eyes so green (I, I know places)
And I know for you, it's always me (Hide, I know places)
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I

"Clean (Taylor's Version)"

The drought was the very worst
Ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months, and months of back and forth
Ah-ah, ah-ah
You're still all over me
Like a wine stained dress I can't wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do
Ah-ah, ah-ah
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
I think I am finally clean
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Said, I think I am finally clean
Ah-ah-ah

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst
Ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

The rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Think I'm finally clean

"Wonderland (Taylor's Version)"

Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn, and we
Fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control

Didn't they tell us "Don't rush into things"
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should've slept with one eye open at night

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh-eh
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better, eh-eh

Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone, or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams, oh

Didn't they tell us "Don't rush into things"
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire Cat smile
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games till somebody loses their mind
Oh, darling

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh-eh
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better, eh-eh

Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland

I reached for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in Wonderland we both went mad, oh

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh-eh (Could last forever)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better, eh-eh (Never better)

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it (In Wonderland)
And we pretended it could last forever (In Wonderland)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it (In Wonderland)
And life was never worse but never better (In Wonderland)

"You Are In Love (Taylor's Version)"

One look, dark room meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you played it back
Buttons on a coat, light-hearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough

Small talk, he drives, coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, "Look up," and your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You, you can feel it on the way home, way home
You, you can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

Morning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough

You kiss on sidewalks, you fight then you talk
One night, he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says, "You're my best friend"
And you knew what it was, he is in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You, you can feel it on the way home, way home
You, you can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love

You are in love
And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, 'round and 'round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now why
They lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You, you can feel it on the way home, way home
You, you can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You, you can feel it on the way home, way home
You, you can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

"New Romantics (Taylor's Version)"

We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my ace

We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up and switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come on, come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded, it's so romantic (It's so romantic)

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
Oh, 'cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
Every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle (Castle)
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

""Slut" (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

Flamingo pink, Sunrise Boulevard
Clink, clink, being this young is art
Aquamarine, moonlit swimmin' pool
What if all I need is you

Got love-struck, went straight to my head
Got lovesick all over my bed
Love to think you'll never forget
Handprints in wet cement
Adorned with smoke on my clothes
Lovelorn and nobody knows
Love thorns all over this rose
I'll pay the price, you won't

But if I'm all dressed up
They might as well be lookin' at us
And if they call me a slut
You know it might be worth it for once
And if I'm gonna be drunk
I might as well be drunk in love

Send the code, he's waitin' there
The sticks and stones they throw froze mid-air
Everyone wants him, that was my crime
The wrong place at the right time
And I break down, then he's pullin' me in
In a world of boys, he's a gentleman

Got love-struck, went straight to my head (Straight to my head)
Got lovesick all over my bed (Over my bed)
Love to think you'll never forget
We'll pay the price, I guess

But if I'm all dressed up (If I'm all dressed up)
They might as well be lookin' at us (Lookin' at us)
And if they call me a slut (If they call me a slut)
You know it might be worth it for once (Worth it for once)
And if I'm gonna be drunk
I might as well be drunk in love

Half asleep, takin' your time
In the tangerine, neon light, this is luxury
You're not sayin' you're in love with me
But you're going to
Half awake, takin' your chances
It's a big mistake, I said, "It might blow up in your pretty face"
I'm not saying, "Do it anyway" (Do it anyway)
But you're going to

(Up)
And if they call me a (Slut)
You know it might be worth it for once
And if I'm gonna be (Drunk)
I might as well be drunk in love

"Say Don't Go (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

I've known it from the very start
We're a shot in the darkest dark
Oh no, oh no
I'm unarmed
The waiting is a sadness
Fading into madness
Oh no, oh no
It won't stop

I'm standing on a tightrope, alone
I hold my breath a little bit longer
Halfway out the door, but it won't close
I'm holding out hope for you to say, "Don't go"
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go"

Why'd you have to lead me on
Why'd you have to twist the knife
Walk away and leave me bleeding, bleeding
Why'd you whisper in the dark
Just to leave me in the night
Now your silence has me screaming, screaming
Say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
Say, say, say, say

Now I'm pacing on shaky ground
Strike a match, then you blow it out
Oh no, oh no
It's not fair
'Cause you kiss me and it stops time
And I'm yours, but you're not mine
Oh no, oh no
You're not there

I'm standing on the sidewalk, alone
I wait for you to drive by
I was trying to see the cards that you won't show
I'm about to fold unless you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
Oh-ah

Why'd you have to lead me on
Why'd you have to twist the knife
Walk away and leave me bleeding, bleeding
Why'd you whisper in the dark
Just to leave me in the night
Now your silence has me screaming, screaming
Say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
Say, say, say, say

Why'd you have to make me want you (Why'd you have to make me want you)
Why'd you have to give me nothing back (Why'd you have to)
Why'd you have to make me love you (Why'd you have to make me love you)
I said, "I love you," you say nothing back (I said, "I love you")

Why'd you have to lead me on
Why'd you have to twist the knife
Walk away and leave me bleeding, bleeding
Why'd you whisper in the dark
Just to leave me in the night
Now your silence has me screaming, screaming
Say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
Say, say, say, say

But you won't
But you won't
But you won't
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go"
But you won't
But you won't
But you won't

"Now That We Don't Talk (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

You went to a party, I heard from everybody
You part the crowd like the Red Sea, don't even get me started
Did you get anxious though, on the way home
I guess I'll never, ever know
Now that we don't talk

You grew your hair long, you got new icons
And from the outside, it looks like you're trying lives on
I miss the old ways, you didn't have to change
But I guess I don't have a say
Now that we don't talk

I called my mom, she said that it was for the best
Remind myself the more I gave, you'd want me less
I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost
And what it cost
Now that we don't talk

What do you tell your friends we
Shared dinners, long weekends with
Truth is, I can't pretend it's
Platonic, it's just ended, so

I called my mom, she said to get it off my chest (Off my chest)
Remind myself the way you faded till I left (Till I left)
I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost (What I lost)
And what it cost
Now that we don't talk

I don't have to pretend I like acid rock
Or that I'd like to be on a mega-yacht
With important men who think important thoughts
Guess maybe I am better off
Now that we don't talk

And the only way back to my dignity
Was to turn into a shrouded mystery
Just like I had been when you were chasing me
Guess this is how it has to be
Now that we don't talk

"Suburban Legends (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

You had people who called you on unmarked numbers
In my peripheral vision
I let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer
All was quickly forgiven
You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious
Flush with the currency of cool
I was always turning out my empty pockets
And when it came to you

I didn't come here to make friends
We were born to be suburban legends
When you hold me, it holds me together
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

I had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs
Would surprise the whole school
When I ended up back at our class reunion
Walking in with you
You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries
With the pages ripped out
I am standing in a 1950s gymnasium
And I can still see you now

I didn't come here to make friends
We were born to be suburban legends
When you hold me, it holds me together
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

I know that you still remember
We were born to be national treasures
When you told me we'd get back together
And you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block
I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it
Waves crash on the shore, I dash to the door
You don't knock anymore, and my whole life's ruined

Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block
I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it
Waves crash to the shore, I dash to the door
You don't knock anymore, and I always knew it
And my life had been ruined

"Is It Over Now (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

Once the flight had flown
With the wilt of the rose
I slept all alone
You still wouldn't go

Let's fast forward to 300 takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for something greater

Baby, was it over when she laid down on your couch
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse
"Come here," I whispered in your ear in your dream as you passed out
Baby, was it over then
And is it over now

When you lost control
Red blood, white snow
Blue dress on a boat
Your new girl is my clone

And did you think I didn't see you There were flashing lights
At least I had the decency to keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs, and my whispered sighs
Oh Lord, I think about jumping
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come running
And say the one thing I've been wanting
But no

Let's fast forward to 300 awkward blind dates later
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every model's bed for something greater

Baby, was it over when she laid down on your couch
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse
"Come here," I whispered in your ear in your dream as you passed out
Baby, was it over then
And is it over now

Think I didn't see you There were flashing lights
At least I had the decency to keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs, and my whispered sighs
Oh Lord, I think about jumping
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come running (Running)
And say the one thing I've been wanting
But no

(Flashing lights, oh Lord) Let's fast forward to 300 takeout coffees later
(Flashing lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no (Oh Lord, oh Lord)

"Bad Blood (Remix) (Taylor's Version)"
(feat. Kendrick Lama)

'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey

I can't take it back, look where I'm at
We was O-G like D.O.C., remember that (Remember that)
My T-L-C was quite O-D, I-D my facts
Now P-O-V of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No, I don't fear no more, better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey

Remember when you tried to write me off
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss
Don't you remember You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember Oh, wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds
Battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey

Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
You forgive, you forget, but you never let it go
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold

'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (Don't think we can solve 'em)
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey

'Cause, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey

"Sweeter Than Fiction (Taylor's Version)"

Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you hear is "No"
You never saw it comin'
Slipped when you started runnin'
And now you've come undone and I, I, I, I

Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh eh
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along"
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it comin'
You hit the ground runnin'
And now you're onto something, I, I, I say

What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along"
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

There you'll stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction (than fiction)

I'll be one of the many saying
"Look at you now, look at you now, now"
I'll be one of the many saying
"You made us proud, you made us proud, proud"
I'll be one of the many saying
"Look at you now, look at you now, now"
I'll be one of the many saying
"You made us proud, you made us proud, proud"

And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when, when you

Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was "No"
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever (forever)

There you'll stand, ten feet tall (ten feet tall)
I will say, "I knew it all along" (I knew it all along)
Your eyes are wider than distance (your eyes)
This life is sweeter than fiction

There you'll stand next to me (next to me)
All at once, the rest is history (ooh)
Your eyes are wider than distance (your eyes)
This life is sweeter than fiction (than fiction)

It's sweeter than fiction
It's sweeter, yeah
It's sweeter than, sweeter
Sweeter than fiction

"...Ready For It (Bloodpop Remix)"

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams (Yeah)
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (The night, my dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I'll take my time
Are you ready for it

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams (Night, in my dreams)
You should see the things we do, baby (We'd do, baby)
Yeah, in the middle of the night in my dreams (My dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it

Night, in my dreams
We'd do, baby
Yeah, in the middle of the night
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby

"All Because Of Ellen"
(with ac Efron)

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
You better run
Outrun my gun

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
You better run
Faster than my bullet

Ellen works a long day
Giving weird interviews in a slick, cool sweater
And it gets kinda weird
Yeah, calling us like we're boyfriend and girlfriend

But it's not 'cause we're just sitting here
And we got cat videos and dance on Betty White and stuff
And it's always gonna get weird
'Cause this song is all about Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
All because of Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
Always end up dancing

I've been on this show
Eight times now and I still remember
Ellen hiding in the bathroom with a hidden camera
And she scared me so bad and I fell and I could've died

She's always asks me who I'm dating
Every time I'm on this show
And I don't even know why
But it gets five million hits on YouTube

'Cause every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
All because of Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
Always end up dancing

"All Night Diner"

I wake up
I stretch out
I wonder what you're doin' right now
Yeah I slept in my make-up again
Tell myself I must be crazy
Thinkin' 'bout him
I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel out of my hair
About that time, you call me
And I'm reminded, without you

I'd be a stranger in an all-night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

I go to work
Work all day
I'm a walking tape recorder
Of everything you say
Walk to the car, dig out my keys
Start thinkin' if you were with anyone but me

I'm a stranger in an all-night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

There you are
On the street
Just standing there, waiting on me
I show you, my new shoes
You say you love them
And baby without you

I'm a stranger in an all-night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

I wake up
I stretch out
I wonder what you're doin' right now

"All Of The Girls You Loved Before"

When you think of all the late nights
Lame fights over the phone
Wake up in the mornin' with someone
But feelin' alone

A heart is drawn around your name
In someone's handwriting, not mine
We're sneakin' out into town
Holdin' hands, just killin' time

Your past and mine are parallel lines
Stars all aligned and they intertwined
And taught you
The way you call me "baby"
Treat me like a lady
All that I can say is

All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

When I think of all the makeup
Fake love out on the town (Ooh)
Cryin' in the bathroom for some dude
Whose name I cannot remember now

Secret jokes all alone
No one's home, sixteen and wild (Ooh)
We're breakin' up, makin' up
Leave without sayin' goodbye (Ooh)

And just know that
It's everything that made me
Now I call you "baby"
That's why you're so amazing

All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

Your mother brought you up loyal and kind
Teenage love taught you there's good in goodbye
Every woman that you knew brought you here
I wanna teach you how forever feels like

The girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street (Dead-end street) led you straight to me (Straight to me)
Now you're all I need (All I need), I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

(I love you more)
(I love you more)

"All Too Well (Sad Girl Autumn Version)"
(Recorded at Long Pond Studios)

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now
He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, oh-oh-oh-oh

And maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
Maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well
Just between us, do you remember it all too well
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Just between us, I remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it

"Am I Ready For Love"

Sometimes I wonder how it's gonna feel
Will my first love be true and real
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall
What will I do when my love comes to call
And my daddy tells me that I light up his world
Every day he says, "Darling, you're my best girl."
He tried to teach me from the very start
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart

Will my love come in a bowl of fire
Will it be filled with hope and desire
Will my love come in a pouring rain
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love

I know I'm not a little girl anymore
'Cause I'm feeling things I've never felt before
Sweet sensations and anticipations
Calling commotion to my emotions
And I hear the words my daddy said to me
He said, "Be true to yourself and keep your spirit free
And love will find you one way or another
Be good to yourself and be good to each other."

Will my love come in a bowl of fire
Will it be filled with hope and desire
Will my love come in a pouring rain
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love

It's a run around the world
And it's moving so fast
Though I wanna find
A love that's gonna last
A love so strong
That it can withstand
The weight of this world
In the palm of its hand

Will my love come in a bowl of fire
Will it be filled with hope and desire
Will my love come in a pouring rain
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game
Am I ready for the kiss, am I ready for the stars
Am I ready for the bliss, am I ready for love

"American Boy"

American boy, living life as it goes
Sittin' on the fence posts
Living in the lie
American boy, living in the real world
Trying just to get the girl
Trying to survive

The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill avenue
And mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in this world can ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy

Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
Looking for the love
Suddenly rise, an American beauty
Suddenly he cheats, sent from above

The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill avenue
And mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The dream of an American boy

American boy, raising little babies
Hearing, "Daddy maybe, I'll be like you"
Suddenly life seems just like a new dawn
That's grown up, American boy

The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Grandview avenue
And mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy

"American Girl"

Well, she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life
Somewhere else

After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die trying
She had one little promise she was gonna keep

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Well, it was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
She could see the cars roll by
Out on 441
Like waves crashing on the beach

And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful
It's something that's so close but still so far out of reach

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Oh, take it easy now

Oh yeah, all right
She was an American girl

"Angelina"

Angelina's got a pretty face
And really long brown hair
Lives somewhere in some wide open space
I've never been there
I guess some people come around and purpose she
But I don't 'cause

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I'm fine just a bit of a mess
And I'm not perfect you could say
I wasn't brought up that way

Just watched Stephen run across the field
Watched him catch the ball
He's got everything you'd wanna be
He's funny, dark and tall
Watch him run across to Angelina
But I won't 'cause

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I'm fine just a bit of a mess
And I'm not perfect you could say
I wasn't brought up that way

Stardom pushed across the line
Tripped over my two feet hey oh yeah
But ain't it funny how
It all comes out
Isn't life sweet

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I'm fine just a bit of a mess
And I'm not perfect you could say

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I'm fine just a bit of a mess
And I'm not, I'm not oh
And I'm not perfect you could say
I wasn't brought up that way

"Anti-Hero (Remix)"
(feat. Bleachers)

I'm the problem, it's me

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is an art bro lately
And I just judge them on the hill
Too hurt to hang out, talking shit about your famous baby
Pierced through the heart of 90's guilt
Maybe, I'm the problem, it's me

Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman
(Taylor, you'll be fine)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

It's me (Me), hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
"She's laughing up at us from Hell"

I'm the problem, it's me
(Taylor)
I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero

"Back To December  Apologize  You're Not Sorry"

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life Tell me, how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up, and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed, and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

And then he said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
He said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

This is me swallowing my pride
(It's too late to apologize)
Standing in front of you
(It's too late)
saying I'm sorry for that night
(It's too late to apologize)
And I go back to December 
(It's too late)
(It's too late to apologize)
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
(It's too late to apologize)
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
(It's too late to apologize)
(It's too late)

He said you're not sorry
(It's too late to apologize)
No, no, no
(It's too late)
You're not sorry
(It's too late to apologize)
No, no, no
You're not sorry
(It's too late)
No, no, no
(It's too late)
You're not sorry
No, no, no

"Bad Blood (Remix)"
(feat. Kendrick Lamar)

[Taylor Swift & Kendrick Lamar]
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love (Uh)
So take a look what you've done (Uh)
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood (Uh), hey (Hey)

[Kendrick Lamar]
I can't take it back, look where I'm at (Uh)
We was OG like D.O.C., remember that (Remember that)
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts (ID my)
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No, I don't fear no more
Better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more, ah

[Taylor Swift]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Taylor Swift & Kendrick Lamar]
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (Uh)
You made a really deep cut (Uh)
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey (Hey)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Remember when you tried to write me off (Uh-huh)
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss
Don't you remember You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember Oh, wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds
Battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

[Taylor Swift]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done

Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey

[Taylor Swift & Kendrick Lamar]
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
You forgive, you forget, but you never let it go
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (Uh, uh)
If you love like that, blood runs cold

[Taylor Swift]

"Beautiful Eyes"

Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into my eyes
And sometimes I think of you late at night
I don't know why, I

I wanna be somewhere where you are
I wanna be where

You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

I wake up, I'm alive
In only a little while I'll cry
'Cause you're my lullaby
So baby, come hold me tight 'cause I-I

I wanna be everything you need
I wanna be where

You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

Just as long as you're mine
I'll be your everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh, baby, let me miss you
Let me see your
Dream about, dream about
Dream about your eyes
Eyes, eyes
Beautiful eyes

"Beautiful Ghosts"
(from "Cats" soundtrack)

Follow me home if you dare to
I wouldn't know where to lead you
Should I take chances when no one took chances on me
So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start
With no beauty in my memory

All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into

And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

Perilous night, their voices calling
A flicker of light before the dawning
Out here, the wild ones
Are taming the fear within me
Scared to call them my friends and be broken again
Is this hope just a mystical dream

All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into

And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

And so maybe my home isn't what I had known
What I thought it would be
But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night
And I know that this life isn't safe but it's wild and it's free

All that I wanted was to be wanted
I'll never wander London streets alone and haunted
Born into nothing
With them I have something, something to cling to
I never knew I'd love this world they've let me into

And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts

"Being With My Baby"

All is quiet in the world tonight
Counting stars and fireflies
And summer sings a lullaby
For me and my baby
On the hood of his daddy's car
We pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
It's just me and my baby
The world is spinning round
'Cause look just what I've found

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
'Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

Driving home by the river side
Wishing I could slow down time
And take a picture with my mind
Of me and my baby
The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
That back road was a better way
For me and my baby
The closer that we get
Oh, I can't leave yet

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
'Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

We both know what we've found
So he turns that car around

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Ooh, hanging with my baby
Hanging with my baby, my baby

"Bette Davis Eyes"

There is some unbelievable music that has come out of artists who are from LA, did you know that
Like Los Angeles has put out so many bands and artists that I'm such a fan of and
I'd love to play you some music that I'm a fan of that's come from LA, is that okay
This one came out in 1981 8 years before I was born and I love this song. It's called "Bette Davis Eyes"

Her hair is Harlow gold
Her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll turn her music on
You won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow
She's got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo stand off sighs
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll let you take her home
It whets her appetite
She'll lay you on her throne
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll expose you
And just knows you
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush (ayy, ayy)
All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes

"Better Off"

I live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
That we won't forget this Sunday
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this - our first kiss

All my friends are saying 
Girl, what are you thinking
You're better off, 
you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't wanna come down
But they make it so tough
'Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want 'cause you're gone

All my friends are saying
Girl, why are you crying
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

You come to my door
In the pouring rain
We know what we don't have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
We don't have to do things their way

All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
Well, they can talk forever, they just don't know better

"Brand New World"

Watch me go into the world today
Watch me try to blow the past away
Watch me laugh and watch me cry
Watch me fall and watch me fly
'Cause I'm living in a brand new world
And you think I'm just another girl
But I'm living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday I'm gonna fly

Watch me catch a star and pin it down
Watch me live another time around
Watch me doubt the things I love
Watch me find what I'm proud of
'Cause I'm living in a brand new world
And you think I'm just another girl
But I'm living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday I'm gonna fly

And I may break my wings
And fall flat on my shattered heart
And I may hit the ground
But I will never fall apart
'Cause I'm living in a brand new world
And you think I'm just another girl
But I'm living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
I'm living in a brand new world
And you think I'm just another girl
But I'm living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday I'm gonna fly

"Breathless"

Here you are now
Fresh from your war
Back from the edge of time
And all that you were
Stripped to the bone
I thought you'd want to know

That when you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
Breathless

Lay down your guns
Too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart
Broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you won't go again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

I'm so glad to see you smiling
So good to hear your laugh
I think that you've found you even
Missed yourself
I'm only asking this because I think that
Truth be told
Oh, you'll never go again
Again, again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
Breathless

When you feel the world is crashing
Come running into my arms

"Brought Up That Way"

Emily comes home from school
Grabs onto her daddy's hand
He says, "Baby girl, what's wrong with you"
She says, "Please, don't make me go back there again."

She said, "I wish there was some way to make them stop it."
So he drives down to that principal's office
And says

"I didn't bring her up so they could cut her down
I didn't bring her here so they could shut her out
I live my whole damn life to see that little girl's smile
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face
She wasn't brought up that way."

Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh, but something's different this time
She doesn't have too much to say

She said, "He tried but there's just some things I won't do."
And through the tears she said, "I couldn't do that to you."
And he said

"I didn't bring you up so he could wear you down
Take that innocent heart and turn it inside out
I live my whole damn life to see my little girl's smile
So don't let nobody take that away
You weren't brought up that way."

The phone rings on a rainy night, says, "It's officer Tate"
He said, "Sir, there's been an accident
You better come down here right away
A drunken driver missed an overpass
And Emily, she's fading fast."

He says, "God, I didn't bring her up to watch them lay her down
Nearly killed me the day they put her own momma in the ground
Only thing kept me alive was that little girl's smile
So please, don't take that away
It won't be easy taking her today
She wasn't brought up that way."

He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyes

"By The Way"

I had to catch my breath
When I saw you there across the room
Holding her hand
I'd have never guessed
That starting over would look so good on you
But here I am
Still believing there might come a day
We'll pick up where we left off

And by the way
Your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way
My heart's still breaking
It's gonna take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say
By the way

I should've let you know
All the ways you made me feel alive
I guess it's too late
So I'll just get my coat
And make my way into this breezy night
Give you one last wave
Maybe you'll drop what you're doing
And come over here to say
I'm looking good

But by the way
Your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way
My heart's still breaking
It's gonna take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say

By the way
You still look amazing
And I must've been crazy to let you get away
By the way
If you ever wondered
Still got the same old number just in case
I still miss you
And I still love you
By the way
By the way, oh

"Can I Go With You"

Any day now, they're talking war
I can see the look that's in your eyes
They're not talking a week or two
Oh, daddy can I go with you
Oh, daddy can I go with you

You pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall
I always knew this time would come
When I ask how long you think you're gonna be
You say, this crazy world's come undone

Summer's over and leaves begin to fall
And another winter's on the way
I knew I wasn't gonna take this very well
But I'd give anything to have you here today

Everyday now they're talking war
And I know this time is like it's never been before
We're not talking about a week or two

Oh, daddy can I go with you
Oh, daddy can I go with you
Oh, daddy can I go with you

"Carolina"
(from "Where The Crawdads Sing" soundtrack)

O Carolina creeks
Running through my veins
Lost I was born
Lonesome I came
Lonesome I'll always stay

Carolina knows
Why for years I roam
Free as these birds
Light as whispers
Carolina knows

And you didn't see me here
No, they never did see me here

And she's in my dreams
Into the mist, into the clouds
Don't leave
I make a fist, I make it count
And there are places I will never ever go
And things that only Carolina will ever know

Carolina stains
On the dress she left
Indelible scars
Pivotal marks
Blue as the life she fled

Carolina pines
Won't you cover me
Hide me like robes
Down the back road
Muddy these webs we weave

And you didn't see me here
No, they never did see me

And she's in my dreams
Into the mist, into the clouds
Don't leave
I make a fist, I make it count
And there are places I will never ever go
And things that only Carolina will ever know

And you didn't see me here
They never did see me here
No, you didn't see me here
They never saw me

O Carolina knows
Why for years they've said
That I was guilty as sin
And sleep in a liar's bed
But the sleep comes fast
And I'll meet no ghosts
It's between me
The sand and the sea
Carolina knows

"Check Out This View"

I don't need a lot, but there's one thing love has taught me
It's to never expect too much
Don't need a believable touch
I just need you
I just need you

Don't need mine, I found mine
Why should we be wasting time

You don't know what you missed
I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything I see looking at you
Check out this view

Think of a quiet beach
Think of how the waves crash down
Think about a summer's eve
No offense to them but they ain't got nothing
You walk in a room
In the light or in the dark
Well, nothing shadows who you are

And you don't know what you missed
I look into your eyes like this
You should be in front of me
Seeing everything I see looking at you
Check out this view

I look outside the window
Everyday, see something new
But all I ever wanted was a window looking at you
At you

You don't know what you missed
I look into your eyes like this
You should be in front of me
Seeing everything I see looking at you

You don't know what you missed
I look into your eyes like this
You should be in front of me
Seeing everything I see looking at you
Check out this view

"Christmas Tree Farm"

My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress, and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes, and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Under the mistletoe
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, "I love you"
Just being in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We'd run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreaming of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Under the mistletoe
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, "I love you"
Just being in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
(Baby, yeah)

And when I'm feeling alone
You remind me of home
Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I'll pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
To you

Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, "I love you"

Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas
(Darling)
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you

Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas
(I just want you to know)
Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas
May your every wish come true

"Closest To A Cowboy"

I drive around this town
In a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well that's good enough for me
Don't need the real thing
That's just another thing
For me to try to tame
Don't know if I could
It might just break me
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I'd be a riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That's the closest to a cowboy
You'll see me

Before I met him
I was so sane and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads
And I got my heart broken
'Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I'd be a riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That's the closest to a cowboy
You'll see me

It was all a little
Wonderful and strange
But I'll never look
At a sunset the same night

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Sitting fishing by the river bank
Swimming in the water tank
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That's the closest to a cowboy
You'll see me

"Crazier"
(from "Hannah Montana The Movie" soundtrack)

I'd never gone with the wind
Just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you open the door
There's so much more
I'd never seen it before

I was trying to fly but I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I've watched from a distance
As you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know
How that would feel
And you made it so real

You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes and you made me believe

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

Baby, you showed me what living is for
I don't wanna hide anymore

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Crazier, crazier.

"Cross My Heart"

I've been counting days and
I've been being patient
About a little thing called love
Crossing all my fingers
Letting my heart linger
Trying to get some help from up above
I don't want to jinx my luck
I've left it all behind me
And I've been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I'll pray for you and me and hope I'm right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

Dreaming of you baby
I've been thinking maybe
There is something I can do
'Cause I've been on the verge of
Running around in circles
Baby all I want is you

I don't want to jinx my luck
I've left it all behind me
And I've been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I'll pray for you and me and hope I'm right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

Do you believe in miracles
Please tell me if you've seen one
I'd like to know just where to go
Because I think I need one

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I'll pray for you and me and hope I'm right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I'll pray for you and me and hope I'm right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

"Cruel Summer (Live from TS  The Eras Tour)"

Oh, hi

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

Alright Los Angeles, we have arrived
At the very first bridge of the evening
Now, I have a question
Does anyone here know the lyrics to this bridge
Prove it

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard"
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard"
Cruel summer with you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
It's a cruel summer with you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
It's a cruel summer

"Cruel Summer (LP Giobbi Remix)"

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

With you
With you
With you

New, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you
New, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true (Ooh, woah-oh)
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you (It's a cruel summer)
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth (Ooh, woah-oh)
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard" (It's a cruel summer)
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true (Ooh, woah-oh)
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you (It's a cruel summer)
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth (Ooh, woah-oh)
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard" (It's a cruel summer)
With you
With you
With you

"Dark Blue Tennessee"

He said, "I got me a nice new apartment
In a city, wouldn't you have hated that
I'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with."
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

He was lying when he said he moved to LA
He's just hiding out on the other side of town
With his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away
He's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

She almost called him on the night that he wrote
These simple words on his goodbye note

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

In dark blue Tennessee

"Didn't They"

She walks to school with her arms crossed
It's just another day
At 10 o'clock she hears this screaming
Then finally she sees them
It's scary how things change

And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried

Didn't she call you
Didn't she need you bad enough
Was there some reason I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't she pray too

He kissed his wife goodbye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle three men walked and said
"We're here to die for our God."
He stood up and said, "That's funny
'Cause my God died for me."

I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried

Didn't he call you
Didn't he need you bad enough
Was there some reason I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't he pray too

The taxis pulled up on the very day of
They rode 100 floors up just to come back down
They never thought they'd see the day
That the tower's up in flames
There was nothing left to say when it all came down

And didn't they call you
Didn't they need you bad enough
Was there some reason I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you Where were you
And didn't they pray too

I walk to school and I wear a cross
I'm counting every day

"Don't Hate Me For Loving You"

My momma stood across the room
Face to face but never eye to eye
Recalling words we said
The battle that we swore
We'd never fight
Breaking pieces off with every lie
A tear came to her eye
And she said

Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you block me out tonight
Honey where are you
And don't hate me for loving you

He walked around my life
And made blind
With every single move
He caught me staring at him
Mad about him
Little that I knew 
Love is different
When you play the fool
And all I wanna do is say

Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you make cry tonight
Like you always do
And don't hate me for loving you

I slammed the door
Sat on the floor
Cried into my bed
Said are you there
Do you even care
To cross above my head
But someone said

Don't turn away now
And don't rip my heart out
Things are meant to happen like this
I know it's right for you
And don't hate me for loving you

I looked up at the sky
Face to face and finally
Eye to eye

"Down Came The Rain"

Here in my mind the sky looks the same
On every day you loved me
When we started home it started to rain
You put your coat around me
We stood there in the road
You held me so close
But did you ever let go

Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we could've been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

In through the window I see her with you
I'm soaked to the skin, you're warm and dry
I guess the storm is over for you
But look at the tears here in my eyes
I just stood there like a ghost
As you held her so close
And as I let you go

Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Love like this changes who you are
Every kiss you gave me is a scar
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

All I need is to move on fast
But all I want is to have you back
And it just keeps falling

Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we could've been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

Down came the rain

"Drama Queen"
(unreleased)

Let's break it down, I'll take the story from the slammin' of the door
Thought it was perfect for a second, guess you weren't quite as sure
Maybe I'm a little hard to get, maybe you didn't have the patience
Let's assess the situation
That girl was biding her time, yeah, she was waiting on your cue
So, somehow, I'm not surprised to see her standin' there with you
Maybe she's a little overdressed and I can see the smile you're fakin'
And the deep breath you're takin'

When you see me now, you're not lookin' at her
Yeah, it's a long way down from the bridges you burned
Might wanna sit down, I'm calling you out
Right now

You're a heartbreaker and she's a little drama queen
I'm a little over it and she's still not me
So long and back to reality
But this song's for you and your drama queen

As I was saying, I was never quite a fan of little games
It doesn't take too long to see that boys like you are all the same
Maybe I'm a little less obsessed, but she's impressed
And I should mention, she's starving for attention

I can see it now, how it's all gonna be
When she freaks out, you'll be thinkin' of me
'Cause what went down is coming back around
You'll see

'Cause you're a heartbreaker and she's a little drama queen
I'm a little over it and she's still not me
So long and back to reality
But this song's for you and your drama queen

Sometimes you get just what you see
Like, you chose her when you could've had me
Everything's a mess now, watch her little meltdown
Wish you both success and I hope you're happy

'Cause you're a heartbreaker, she's a little drama queen
I'm a little over it and she's still not me
So long and back to reality
But this song's for you and your drama
Heartbreaker and she's a little drama queen
I'm a little over it and she's still not me
So long and back to reality
But this song's for you and your drama queen

Huh-oh, for you and your drama queen
Oh-oh-oh-oh, you and your drama queen
Huh-oh, baby, you're a drama queen

"Eyes Open"
(from "The Hunger Games" soundtrack)

Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open

The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score

Keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around), oh they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown) and nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just gotta keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes

Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open

Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping

Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

"Eyes Open (Taylor's Version)"

Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching

The tricky thing

Winnin' battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score

"Fall Back On You"

Isn't it funny how many times we can say
We've drawn the line, crossed it out, turned the page
And moved on
That's what we thought
But here I am in the same old car
Having myself another same old brown-eyed thought
Uh oh, uh oh

I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road 'til the one we're on ends
And we'll tell each other things like I need you

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I finally see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
I'll fall back on you

We always let someone come in between
Talk around the truth and never say what we mean
Look at all this wasted time

You won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end
And we'll tell each other things like I love you

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I finally see
There are people that you come back to
So fall back on me
I'll fall back on you

Maybe we'll last
Maybe we won't
Maybe we'll stop talking and I'll haunt you like a ghost
But just maybe, you belong with me

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I finally see
There are people that you come back to
So fall back on me
Baby, I'll fall back on you
Fall back on me
Baby, baby, I'll fall back on you
Fall back on you, ooh, ooh
Fall back on you

"Firefly"

Someone struck a match against the night
All I could see was you and I
I was captivated
A perfect little dream inside my head
And then reality crept in, and erased it

For a while I thought that I could hold you
But you were just a temporary high

Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you
I wish I could keep you, firefly
Firefly

Something so beautiful and free
Was as never meant to be caged in
I thought I had you in my hand
I tried to catch you, but I can't
Chase the wind

And just as I reach out to touch you
I remind myself you were meant to fly

Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

I like to think I'd be all that you wanted
Not even that is enough

Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it do you
I wish I could keep you
I wish I could keep you, firefly
Firefly

"For You"

It would've been nice to see you coming
But that would've ruined the surprise
It would've been nice to have a picture perfect world
But then the truth would hurt my eyes
It would've been good for you to be there
And every time you always would
Everything seems to have a picture perfect time
And nothing seems to be a blur

It's hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
It's nice to know you're here and you're helping me down
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one for you

Would've been cool to never fall down
But then I never would've seen
The power isn't with the picture perfect person
You told me better things to come from in between

It's hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
It's nice to know you're here and you're helping me down
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one, saying one, saying one for you

It would've been nice to see you coming
But that would've ruined the surprise
It would've been nice to have a picture perfect world
But then the truth would hurt my eyes

But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one for you...

"Gracie"

My name's Gracie
I'll be five in May
Kind of scared 'cause
I've never been on a plane
My mama says that it'll be alright
'Cause I'm going to see my daddy tonight
And she says that

There's a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

My name's Heather
Guess we're on the same flight
Don't mind Gracie
She could talk to you all night
She's finally well enough to travel
Doctor says she's in the clear
She's been in and out of hospital
Since the beginning of the year

There's a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

James T. Johnson
That's her daddy's name
He's been overseas
It'll be a year today
He never talked about being scared over the phone
He just said me and Gracie will come and take him on

There's a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

And the people that we meet
As we go through the rain
There are no accidents in what we do

"Her"

She's real pretty if you're into that brunette
Looks good without any makeup on
Green eyes kind of thing
Uh huh
She's spontaneous, she ain't afraid of anything
She's not the jealous type
She's the type you give a diamond ring

And I came along, just after she walked out
Picking up the pieces 'til I've figured out

There's a girl that you want
She's everything that I am not
And you can't stop thinking about her
There's a thin little line
And it's like you cross it every time
When you can't stop thinking about her

She came from a really small town
She liked to watch football with you
Well, I'd learn football too, if you wanted me to
Uh huh
She's really good with babies, she'd be a great mother
She said I should really meet her sometime
Uh huh

It's getting old, I wonder if you've seen
The favorite conversation's killing me

There's a girl that you want
She's everything that I am not
And you can't stop thinking about her
There's a thin little line
And it's like you cross it every time
When you can't stop thinking about her

Don't you know I was a 4.0 in school

"Honey Baby"

I think of you every single evening
As I lay awake at night
I try to think try to walk away with you...me in
And I say

Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us
Say that everything will be fine
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine
'Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby
Oh

Flying high, I can see his smiling
As we walk down by the drives
Take my hand, take my breath away
'Cause you make me feel like flying

Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us
Say that everything will be fine
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine
'Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby

Oh, you are everything I'll ever need
Oh, you are everything I wanna be
Drive me crazy, have me baby
All I really wanna say is

Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us
Say that everything will be fine
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine
'Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby

"Hopelessly Devoted To You"

Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know
There's just no getting over you

You know I'm just a fool who's willing
To sit around and wait for you
But, baby, can't you see
There's nothing else for me to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

My head is saying, "Fool, forget him."
My heart is saying, "Don't let go.
Hold on 'til the end."
And that's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

"I Heart "

Wish I had concentrated
They said love was complicated
But it's something I just fell into
And it was overrated
But just look what I created
I keep my life in black and blue
Before you ask me if I'm alright
Think about what I had to do, ooh yeah

Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart, put on my make-up
Another mess I didn't plan
And I'll bet you thought you beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand

I'll be fine if you just walk by
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right
But I can't believe you made me
Sit at home, cry like a baby
Wait right by the phone every night

And now you ask about you and I
There's no you and I
Remember what you put me through

I had to wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart, put on my make-up
Another mess I didn't plan
And I'll bet you thought you beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand

And when you're home all alone at night
You'll still wonder why
You took everything I had, oh baby
I haven't thought about you and I
There's no you and I
And I know someday you will

Wake up and smell the breakup
Realize that we won't make-up
It didn't go the way you planned
And you'll know you didn't beat me
When you look down and see
I got an I heart question mark written on the back of my hand

Written on the back of my hand
An I heart question mark, yeah
Written on the back of my hand

"I Knew You Were Trouble (Music-Video Version)"

I think - I think when it's all over,
It just comes back in flashes, you know
It's like a kaleidoscope of memories.
It just all comes back. But he never does.
I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen.
It's not really anything he said or anything he did,
It was the feeling that came along with it.
And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again.
But I don't know if I should.
I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright.
But I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you
Maybe he knew that when he saw me.
I guess I just lost my balance.
I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him.
It was losing me.

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies. He'll never see you cry,
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

I don't know if you know who you are until you lose who you are.

"I Knew You Were Trouble (Remix)"
(feat. Sammy Adams)

[Taylor Swift]
Once upon time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me-e-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me-e-e-e-e

And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Until you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

[Sammy Adams]
Double platinum wherever she go
Shout to French Torino
Met her out in Vegas, I'm not in no casino
Red lips so hard to miss
What's wrong with being promiscuous
And I can teach you bad bad things if you into it
Don't need to get intimate just yet
Slow down I know that you're thinking you and me just met
But, girl, I got the remedy, most important the chemistry
Good girl gone bad, too much for a Kennedy
So, some say some say they sold their souls for a couple hits
I'd rather live the life of gold with the perfect chick
'Cause that one moment so breathless and you're hoping
That you'll feel the same way same way
Sparks glowing off that cute face and that sharp smile, oh, man
I haven't crushed this hard in quite awhile, oh, dang
And I could care less that you're famous
We gon' make the perfect couple
'Cause my first name Big, last name Trouble

[Taylor Swift]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Until you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything, yeah

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Until you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

"I Know What I Want"

I like my music loud
I like my windows down
So I can scream
I like my trucks a little
Bigger than the rest
So I can see
Don't try me
Don't fight me
You be you and I'll be me

They say I've always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you

Your mom and daddy's walls
Are covered up in pictures of you
You never met a mirror
That you didn't look again into
So sorry, don't worry
I'm sure there are so many girls
Who love you like you do

They say I've always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you

Oh baby, don't persuade me
I know that you ain't used to no
So let me say it real slow

They say I've always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you

They say I've always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you

"I Want You Back"

Ooh baby give me one more chance
(I'll show you that I love you)
Oh won't you please let me
Back in your heart

Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms

I want you back
I want you back
I want you back

I want you back(I want you back), ooh-ooh baby

I want you back
I want you back
I want you back

Oh-whoa-oh

Ooh baby give me one more chance
(I'll show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms
I want you back
I want you back
Ooh-ooh baby

"I Wished On A Plane"

Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kind of hard to aim

Like the tree we carved our names in
There must be an explanation
Guess it didn't get enough rain
I need reasons why you're leaving

Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written on your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

Diving off into the deep end
Honestly believed you'd be there
When I jumped in
Guess it ain't your territory
We had the perfect love story
Except the ending
Nothing comes true
When it comes to you, oh

Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

The night was so cloudy
It's not my fault
I just couldn't see

And I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
Guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kind of hard to aim

"I'd Lie"

I don't think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes

He'll never fall in love he swears
As he runs his fingers through his hair
I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong

And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs

And I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him,
I'd lie

He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn't a light go on
Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long

He sees everything in black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine

I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him,
I'd lie

He stands there, then walks away
My God, if I could only say,
"I'm holding every breath for you."

He'd never tell you, but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up
Is "My God, he's beautiful"
So I put on my make-up
And pray for a miracle

Yes, I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, oh, and it kills me
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
If you asked me if I love him
I'd lie

"If This Was A Movie (Taylor's Version)"

Last night, I heard my own heart beatin'
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reachin'
Even though I know you're not there
I was playin' back a thousand memories, baby
Thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends are laughin'
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Back before I knew how much I had to lose

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my front door

And I say, "Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now"

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby, what about the ending
Oh, I thought that you'd be here by now
Oh, oh
Thought you'd be here by now

"In The Pouring Rain"

I loved you for a little, a little while
I think you know that
It would have worked for a little
Except for that day you...
It's not like you to be here
When you said you won't

But in the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed the tune
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules
It's not like we could forget something quickly
Except in the pouring rain
It kills me to say this
It really does, it kills my heart
But I might still love you
Reason we're just fallen apart
But it's not like me to answer
Gonna change my mind

But in the pouring rain, you changed everything
You changed the tune
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules
And it's not like we could forget something quickly
Except in the pouring rain

Oh, am I...
All I torn myself I would be losing
But in the pouring rain, can you feel my pain
My tears are falling down from the sky
In the pouring rain, I can feel...
I wonder who you love tonight
Oh, in the pouring rain
In the pouring rain
Oh, in the pouring rain
In the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed my mind

"Just South Of Knowing Why"

She didn't have a reason to go, oh no
She didn't have a reason to stay
Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run

And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow

If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why

I didn't really know her that well
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
She felt so out of touch, because she just felt too much
If you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough

And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
That's where I'm headed right now

If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why

I don't have a plan, I don't have a map
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
I don't have a when and I don't have a where
I don't even know if I'll know when I'm there

But if I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs
I just drive on by

I just drive on by, drive on, drive on
Drive all night
If I drive on, drive on, drive on
Drive all night, just south of knowing why

"Lavender Haze (Acoustic Version)"

Staring at the ceiling with you

My melancholia

You handle it beautifully

I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

"Let's Go (Battle)"

The first shot's fired, everybody's gathered around
You're looking at me like I tried to take you down
No, no, that's not what happened at all
There's no sound, I'm waiting on your next move
A showdown and I know where to hit you
But no, no, it's not how I wanted this to go down

Now we're standing in the ring
And you make the first swing
And now we're fighting dirty
Won't somebody come say "break it up"

And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And why you're taking shots at me like
Somebody's gonna give you a medal
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Baby let's go, oh, oh
Let's go, oh, oh

So gloves off, if this is how you want it
We had it all, but you couldn't keep a promise
No, no, I'm not the one who tore us apart
Let me remind you for a minute why we're not fine
Is she here Is she standing on the sidelines
Oh, oh, can't you tell this is breaking my heart

Now we're standing in the ring
And you make the first swing
And now I'm fighting dirty
But I ain't going down 'til they break it up

And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And why you're taking shots at me like
Somebody's gonna give you a medal
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Let's go, oh, oh
Let's go, oh, oh

Now we're standing in the ring
Breaking everything
That we've been building up so long
And I don't wanna do this break it up

But you're not who I thought you were
And this is looking more like a war
Looks like we're going to war

And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And I'm trying not to break down crying
No one's gonna give you a medal
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side
I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Baby let's go, oh, oh
Looks like we're going to war
Oh, oh

The first shot's fired, everybody's gathered around
You're looking at me like I tried to take you down
No, no, but if you wanna fight, baby, let's go

"Live For The Little Things"

One daybreak, one heartache
Every once-upon-a-time
That black dress, happiness
Bubble baths and quarter lines

They mean so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one

Clear midnights and this spotlight
Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
A blue bonnet, a braid on it
Quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
Live for the little things

Oil paintings and making
Every detail turn out bad
One last stands, new romance
Living for that love and person

They mean so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one

Clear midnights and this spotlight
Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
A blue bonnet, a braid on it
Quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
Live for the little things

Ohh, yeah
Ohh

No fighting, black riding
Wish upon a star and give the moon a smile
Pretending, defending
Take a risk and go along for the ride
Strawberries and fairies with wings
Live for the little things

Na na na
Oh, yeah
Na na na
Ohh, yeah
Na na na

"Long Time Coming"

I got a lying smile I never put out for you
Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
And they say little girls have big dreams
And nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it'd be a long time going

They say it's better to have lost than never to have loved at all
And I say, whoever said that didn't have too far to fall
And they say little girls are so naive
That wasn't how it was supposed to be with me and you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

I've burned my bridges, had sleepless nights
Washed my sins on the neon lights
And I'm still not over you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

A long time going

And it will be a long time, long time going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

It will be a long time, long time going, going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

"Look At You Like That"

There you are
Standing there looking like you don't know what to say
But I know that face
And here I am
Bracing myself for what I know is coming my way
What a waste

For all of that time, I thought you were mine
Was I just kidding myself
Letting it go and loving you so
Don't you dare tell me not to look at you like that

I'm gonna look at you like that
I'm gonna hang my head and turn my back
To your sneak attack
If it's the last thing that I do
I'm gonna make this hard on you
While I look at you like that

Don't you say
That we can still be friends, it doesn't work that way
The end is the end
And don't you dare think
That I'll pack up all my tears and take them home
And cry them out when I'm alone

I'll do it right here, I'm crying right now
You come and you can watch me crumble down
That's for breaking my heart, so, baby, don't start
Thinking you can ask me not to look at you like that

I'm gonna look at you like that
I'm gonna hang my head and turn my back
To your sneak attack
If it's the last thing that I do
I'm gonna make this hard on you
While I look at you like that

Don't you tell me to be strong
Or make it harder than it has to be
After you are gone
You'll remember what you've done to me

'Cause I'm gonna look at you like that
Gonna hang my head and turn my back
To your sneak attack
If it's the last thing that I do
After what you put me through
I'm gonna have to let you know
How much it hurts to let you go

Oh yeah
Gonna look at you like that
Look at you, look at you, look at you
Like that

"Look What You Made Me Do"
(Music Video Version)

I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams

(Ooh, look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you just made me do)
"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now."
(Look what you just made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
"Why"
(Look what you just made me do)
"Oh, 'cause she's dead" (Oh)

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

"Love Story (Taylor's Version) (Elvira Remix)"

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go"
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go"
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Oh, oh

But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come"
Is this in my head I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

"Love They Haven't Thought Of Yet"

I want it all to appear before my eyes when he smiles
Maybe I'm wrong but I don't think Romeo would be my kind of guy
I want a love that's sweeter than roses
And for me this is how it's gonna be

Like there's a fairytale sky
And it whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet

Here on the couch with a box of chocolates that I bought myself
I'll wait it out but sometimes my patience just needs a little help
It's what you get when your heartstrings are so tied
I don't regret it 'cause it needs to be perfect

Like there's a fairytale sky
And it whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet

I want my own little storybook ending
We'll make it up as we go

There's a fairytale sky
And it whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet

I want love they haven't thought of yet

"Love To Lose"

Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out
Sorry for the inconvenience, I didn't mean to let you down
We were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see that to me
You were the perfect view of misery

I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the days he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

Let's talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night
How was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside
He smiled and I smiled, well the camera's in your mind
And I lied, I swore that everything was fine

I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

I know you wanna talk about me
How I gave up on love so foolishly
But keep in mind

I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out

"Lover (First Dance Remix)"

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years

Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close
Forever and ever, ah
Ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years

Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close
Forever and ever
And ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

We could light a bunch of candles
And dance around the kitchen, baby
Pictures of when we were young would hang on the wall
We would sit on the stoop
I'll sing love songs to you when we're eighty
See, I finally got you now, honey, I won't let you fall

Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close forever and ever
And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
Look in my eyes, they will tell you the truth
The girl in my story has always been you
I'd go down with the Titanic, it's true, for you, lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover (Save you a seat)

Can I go where you go (Can I go where you go, baby)
Can we always be this close forever and ever
And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

"Macavity"
(feat. Idris Elba)
(from "Cats" soundtrack)

Macavity's a mystery cat, he's called the Hiddenpaw
For he's the master criminal who can defy the law
He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair
For when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there

Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity
His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare
But when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there

Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin
You would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in
His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed
He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake
And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake

Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
For he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity's not there

He's outwardly respectable, I know, he cheats at cards
And his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland Yard's
And when the larder's looted and the jewel case is rifled
Or when the milk is missing or another peke's been stifled
Or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair
There's the wonder of the thing, Macavity's not there

Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare
What ever time the deed took place, Macavity wasn't there
And they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
I might mention Mungojerrie, Rumpleteazer, Griddlebone
Are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time
Just controls the operations, the Napoleon of Crime
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity, Macavity
Macavity, Macavity

When a crime's discovered, then
Macavity's not there

"Made Up You"

Your feet under the table
I love it when they're touching mine
Your hands make the best kind of cradle
To tell me everything is fine
All I see is you looking at me

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

You smile just like a picture
It doesn't even need a frame
Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my name
And all I want is just what I've got

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

I'd never let you go
Even If I could
Cause I never could've dreamed you up this good

Oh oh

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

Made Up You

Oh oh

Made Up You

"Making Up For Lost Love"

I need you more than I know how to mention
And I'd give forever to get your attention
Be you're summer midnight with starry blue eyes
That only see you and are yours every night
Ooh, ooh, love's like this
It's something I missed
Ooh, ooh, love's like this

And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
'Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

All of the days that I couldn't get it right
It all disappeared lying here by your side
With your dirty blue jeans and my crooked smile
You make it look easy changing my life
Ooh, ooh, love's like this
It's something I missed
Ooh, ooh, love's like this

And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
'Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

Heaven had quite the time
To figure this life out
But baby I've got mine
To give you everything you dream about
Ooh, ooh, love's like this
It's something I missed
Ooh, ooh, love's like this

And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
'Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
'Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

"Mandolin"

He's got a nice little life
He's gonna live it, but on
Friday nights he plays that mandolin
Painted red, and he said
It's not the best I know
But it's mine, I'm gonna make it mine

People there can't help but care
About the friendly music of a guy
Who's getting by from their applause
He's got a song that moves along
He's got his local crowd tonight
At Angelina's family bar and grill

He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin

Got a car, got a scar
Like everyone he's got a few but
Everybody loves that mandolin
Got his problems, bills to pay
Somehow that boy finds a way
Through paychecks in tip jars, yeah

He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin

Oh he's the kind of guy
Who never really wanted fame
His feet are planted firmly on the ground
He never wanted people to remember his name
He never wanted word to get around
That he found heaven on earth

He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin
Oh, I'm the guy who plays the mandolin
Mandolin
Oh, mandolin

"Matches"

I shined your shoes
I poured the wine
I gave you all of my time

I patched your dance smile
That your friends
Which apparently is a crime

I gave you space
You took my place
And gave it to her

But life's too long
To waste it all loving a liar

And when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it down

I keyed her car
Got my guitar
And wrote this damn song

Look what you've found
She's been around
I hear the lines long

And don't you tell me
To be nice
I'm not a nice girl

She died from complications
Of the things you told her

So when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it down

Ain't it funny
You said honey
You meant sitting duck
Well i say cheater, liar, truck on fire, loser, leaver, deceiver
Just a few I've thought of

And when love hands me matches now
'Gonna burn it down
I'm gonna burn it down
Oh yeah
Gonna burn it, burn it, burn it down

Matches, now

"Me And Britney"

Me and Britney used to sit on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever supposed to hear
In the summer shade
She said she was gonna be a movie star
And I said she was crazy
Catching dreams and fireflies in a jar
Just me and Britney

Oh, oh
We were babies, we were beautiful and free
Oh, oh
There was nothing that was out of reach
For me and Britney

She never made it to Hollywood but she made it to Memphis
And this little old town just hasnt been the same since
That boy she went ran off with, well I thought he was crazy
Maybe I was just jealous that he'd come between me and Britney

Oh, oh
She was in love, she was beautiful and free
Oh, oh
She was always so much braver than me

When the phone rang in the middle of the night
Before she said a word I knew it was her
She said Im sorry for waking you up but I didnt know who else to call
Or where else to go

Me and Britney sat down on the front porch
Talking about love and how it changes things
Changes people and it changes names and everything but me and Britney

Oh, oh
Were not as young, but were still beautiful and free
Oh, oh
Even when were old, were still gonna be

Me and Britney sitting on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever gonna hear in the summer shade

"Monologue Song (La La La)"

I like glitter and sparkly dresses,
But I'm not gonna talk about that
In my monologue
I like baking and things that smell like winter,
But I'm not gonna talk about that
In my monologue

La la la, la la la

I like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me,
But I'm not gonna say that
In my monologue
I like writing their names into songs so they're ashamed to go in public,
But I'm not gonna say that
In my monologue

La la, la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

You might think I'd bring up Joe,
The guy who broke up with me on the phone,
But I'm not gonna mention him
In my monologue
Hey Joe I'm doing real well,
Tonight I'm hosting SNL
But I'm not gonna brag about that
In my monologue

La la la, ha ha ha
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha
La la la

And if you're wondering if I might,
Be dating the werewolf from Twilight,
(Hi Taylor)
I'm not gonna comment on that
In my monologue

La la, la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

You might be expecting me to say
Something bad about Kanye
And how he ran up on the stage
And ruined my VMA monologue.....

But there's nothing more to say
Cause everything's okay
I've got security lining this stage
This is my SNL monologue

La la, la la la la la
This is my SNL monologue
La la, la la la la la
That was my SNL monologue

"My Cure"

I know we've got a lot to say
Between now and forever
But I'd be a game if you would play
And my dear you get better

All throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do
Is follow you

If you leave I'll be crawling back for more
If you need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure

Wherever you think I am tonight
Just know we're miles from a heartbreak
Because in the blink of a pretty brown eye
I'll be right where you are baby

Sometime along the way you take my breath away
Distracted by he view
I fall right into you

And if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

They say I need to see all the people out there waiting
But you take one look at me
And I know the mistake I'd be making

Because if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you be my cure

I know we've got a lot to say between now and forever

"Need"

Want is the cigarette smoke on a jacket
You wore to the wrong part of town
Desire is the sound of the whiskey
Telling me you miss me, can you come around

Passion is a passing thing
It's accidental chemistry
Lust is a liar, a short-lived fire
It ain't what you and I are at all

Oh, it's a need, it's a need
I would go anywhere that you lead
I am hopeless, breathless, burning slow
Touch me, hold me, tell me, "I won't let you go"
I won't leave, it's a need

Danger is a thousand prickles on my neck
That tell me to run or to freeze
Fear is the nightmare I had, you were with someone else
You forgot about me

Passion is a passing thing
It's accidental chemistry
Caught up in a feeling, it can be deceiving
This is like breathing for me

Oh, it's a need, it's a need
I would go anywhere that you lead
I am hopeless, breathless, burning slow
Touch me, hold me, tell me, "I won't let you go"
I won't leave, it's a need

Baby, it's always
A new kiss every time we do this
The truth is
It's essential to me
That you love me more than
Wishing, longing

Oh, it's a need (It's a need), it's a need (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
I would go (I would go) anywhere (Anywhere) that you lead (Oh, oh)
I am hopeless, breathless, burning slow (Burning slow)
Touch me, hold me, tell me, "I won't let you go"
I won't leave (I won't leave), it's a need (Oh)

"Need You Now"

I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

I need you now
Words I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came

My world's a little colder now
But I'm keeping warm somehow

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you
I don't need you don't need you now

"I need you now"
Words I heard you whisper to me
While we were walking down a one-way street

You need me now
That's what you've been telling my friends
But I've come too far to go back there again

My heart my mind and numbers have changed
You might as well forget my name

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you don't need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you
I don't need you don't need you now

"I need you now"
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you don't need you
And I waited so frustrated
So who's gonna hold you
I don't need you now
And I don't know where you are
I don't wonder where you are
I don't dream about you cause I don't need you now

I don't dream about the way
That I never heard you say
"I need you I need you"
I don't need you now

Don't need you
Don't need you now

"Nevermind"

Look at you
Look at me
Look at who we could be
I wanna know who you are
What you want from the stars
And every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you

And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind

All the time
Everyday
There's nothing I can do, baby, to make it go away
So look at you
And look at me
And think of who we could be
But every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you

And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind

All I really wanna say is I need you, babe
But how could you understand
What happens if you turn away and everything turns blue and grey
And I just wish I told you never mind
And I could tell you now, but baby, never mind
Yeah, oh yeah
I could tell you now but never mind
Yeah, oh yeah yeah
And I could tell you now but never mind

"New Romantics (Music-Video Version)"

"The fans are the best part of this tour
They are the reason the shows are incredible
And I know those fans out there, are just all in"

We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We're so young but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace

We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come on, come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded
It's so romantic

"I don't wanna forget anything that happened on this tour
It was one of those remarkable moments in time when everything felt exciting.
1989"

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

"Looking out into like an endless ocean of crowd
That was everything
We're all really sad that it's ending
But we're really happy because of what it was"

"One Thing"

It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
And there's nothing to say and I try to grab at the fray
'Cause I, I still love you but I can't

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah

The picture frame is empty
It's black and white, you're smiling down at me
I take your photo off the dash
And back to the conversation
I was so sure of everything, everything I thought we'd always have
I'm lost in the sound of it
But here in the now comes in
Seems like I'm becoming part of your past

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me

And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And I can feel you like you're slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah, yeah
There was one thing I knew would never leave me

It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin

"One Way Ticket"

Standing on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
There's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
I'm heading out tonight, traveling light
I'm gonna start all over again

And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
'Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting, down at the station
All I had to do was make up my mind

And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
'Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Well, I have walked through the fire
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out

Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
'Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know

Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
I'm gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
Gonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings
Gonna climb that mountain, gonna do everything

"Only The Young"
(from "Taylor Swift Miss Americana" soundtrack)

It keeps me awake
The look on your face
The moment you heard the news
You're screaming inside
And frozen in time
You did all that you could do
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think they're right
You were outnumbered  this time

But only the young
Only the young
Only the young
Only the young can run
Can run, so run
And run, and run

So every day now
You brace for the sound
You've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly, they forget

They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun

Only one thing can save us
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young

Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young
Only the young (Only the young)
(Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time
Up there's the finish line)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young
Can run

Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (Can run)
Up there's the finish line
So run, and run, and run
Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (So run)
Up there's the finish line
And run, and run, and run

Only the young
Only the young
Only the young

"Perfect Have I Loved"

If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you 'til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved

Do you remember the stupid things we used to do
Before September stole me away from you
The time we got your truck stuck in the creek
'Cause, baby, roads weren't wild enough for you and me, sayin'

If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you 'til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved

I used to see you by the bridge we used to cross
I found the feeling of trying to get lost
You would smile that smile that I tried so hard to forget
It's hard to douse a fire that I still haven't put out yet

And if you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you 'til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved

Love was all we knew, and faith was growing on the vines
Words were all we had, and for one summer, you were mine
Sayin'

If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you 'til I'm old, but if I can't, at least I'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved

"Permanent Marker"

I know he loved you
A long time ago
I ain't jealous of you
Just thought you should know

You were never good enough for him
Or anything like me
So you might as well sit back
'Cause I ain't trying to show maturity

"" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

I found that picture
Of you in that green dress
You sure had a good time
Cleaning up that mess

He found 30 other pieces
But he'll never find them all
Tried to tape it back together
Now he knows to keep it off the wall

"" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

"" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart

"" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark that you knew that you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

In permanent marker

Oh, permanent marker

"Revenge"

I could've keyed your car
I could've rolled your yard
I know the passwords to your e-mails, everything you do
I could've put 'em to good use

But I'm dressed to kill and tonight I'm going out on a date
With your best friend, he always liked me anyway

R-E-V-E-N-G-E
My list of things to do this week
Jealousy, misery, gonna give you what you gave to me
Make you feel so B-A-D
Break you, make you sorry
I hope you cry getting my R-E-V-E-N-G-E

So I'm gonna paint the town with him
Replace your memory, everywhere we've ever been
I don't hang out at smokey bars but I know we'll see you there
And I'll make you hear me laughing, like I just don't care

I know you hate my friends so tonight I called 'em all
Later on you can expect some prank phone calls, baby

"Ronan"

I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back

I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me, waking me up

I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming "Why"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
Out of this curtained room in this hospital grey, we'll just disappear
Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you
What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you

Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back

"Safe & Sound"
(feat. The Civil Wars)
(from "The Hunger Games" soundtrack)

I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, "I'll never let you go."
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone,"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window, darling.
Everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone
Gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
La, la (la, la)
La, la (la, la)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
La, la (la, la)

Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light,
You and I'll be safe and sound...

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh

"Safe & Sound (Taylor's Version)"

I remember tears streaming down your face when I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come, morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window, darlin', everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps ragin' on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone, gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come, morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh)

Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come, morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

"Spinning Around"

Days go by, I wonder if you hear me
Can't you read between the lines
Now I'm standing still, I am disappearing
Take this chance, I'll make you mine

Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

He tells lies, are you really thinking
That you deserve another try
When you see these eyes
You see another planet
Don't ask how, but fate decides

Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning and turning
And living and learning
I should be able to handle this
Make it or break it
Move it or shake it
Do it or fake it
Girl you've got to make it

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And all I see is you

"Stupid Boy"

Let me know, how's it feel
To be under my skin, wrapped around my heart
Is it like anywhere you've been
And everything I do, I do it just for you
So why the hell don't you love me
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you
Why you so far above me
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

I have been looking in, trying to read your mind
Give you the benefit of the doubt, every single time
And then you walk right by, I'm screaming out inside
Why the hell don't you love me
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you
Why you so far above me
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

What happens when you wake up, to see that you've lost
You take one look at me, 'cause that's what it cost
I just wanna be everything you need
'Cause you're everything to me

So why the hell don't you love me
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you
Why you so far above me
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

Let me know, how's it feel to be under my skin

"Sugar"

What a thing to see
What a thing to be
What a perfect love, what a perfect home
'Cause every time she walks
And every time she talks
Is every time he knows what a perfect world he's living on

But whenever he's gone and when she's all alone
His heart goes out to her on the telephone

And he says, "Sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time"
He calls her "Sugar" 'cause she's the sweetest thing
Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find

With her midnight hair
And with his favorite stare
She's a southern belle, he's a rockout king
When she looks around
Oh, she knows she's found
Such a perfect life, such a perfect thing

And whenever he's gone and when she's all alone
His heart goes out to her on the telephone

And he says, "Sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time"
He calls her "Sugar" 'cause she's the sweetest thing
Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find

Oh, there's a reason for every season
There's a change within the range of every heart
But the reason and the season
Seem to be right so far

And he says, "Sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time"
He calls her "Sugar" 'cause she's the sweetest thing
Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find

He calls her "Sugar"

"Sweet Tea And God's Graces"

Tire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
Wilson County creek
Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass
Baby, you were watching me
Cold barns, truck beds, everything you said
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
Just like the two of us
Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
Guess I loved you way too much
But I'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder
But it's still soft enough to cry
'Cause I remember those times

I remember

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Saw you just the other day
All that I could think to say was
"Hey, how have you been"
You caught me with that old smile
Said, "It's really been a while
And I still think about back when..."

We used to get high on the first kiss
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and now I'm someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Oh, that's what I learned from you
That's what I learned from you, oh you, oh
That's what I learned from you, oh yeah

"Tell Me"

It was something like a perfect start to this love yesterday
But now who are you
I thought I knew
Your eyes happen now to look right through me
It's like you forgot the words you whispered to me
They weren't true
It's like it wasn't you

Could you tell me what did I do
Because it can't be we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool after you held me
Was that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me

Take time to realize
I know that people change their minds
But that was something I wished you would say to my face
But you ran away

Could you tell me what did I do
Because it can't be we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool after you held me
Was that just what you do
What did you need from me
Tell me

If I had a reason or a simple goodbye
Baby, even a lie
Yeah, yeah

Tell me what did I do
'Cause, baby, suddenly we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool after you held me
Was that just what you do
What did you need from me
And tell me

And tell me
Oh-oh-oh, oh-yeah
And tell me
Tell me

"Ten Dollars And A Six Pack"

You were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldn't have
You were country lovin'
Really somethin' for three months and a half
Everybody said that you were bad news
But, baby, I was betting on you

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
I guess I'm gonna have to listen to my mama's "I told you so"
But you ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

I said, "Let them say we're crazy," you said, "Let's go fishing tonight"
The midnight moon was blazing baby, I was looking into your eyes
Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
I guess I'm gonna have to listen to my mama's "I told you so"
But you ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

Can't believe the time you lost me
Can't believe what it cost me

I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
Had to go and listen to my mama's "I told you so"
You ain't never been through that
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

"Tennessee"

Standing on a street somewhere I don't wanna be
In a town that's made of stone
Some bad directions must have me here by mistake
'Cause this sure ain't what I call home

Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can get out of here, and

Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
And I'm in Tennessee

Standing on a road leading to a barn
With a cat named Eloise
Later on, we'll all go fishing in the pond
But all we'll catch is just a summer breeze

Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can stay right here, and

Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
And I'm in Tennessee

When the pond is gone and Eloise floats away
I find myself staring at the same old day
I need to go back, back to where I feel so free
Well, it looks like I'm going back to Tennessee

I let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
Just me and Eloise
And I'm in Tennessee

"That's Life"

Like one of those fireflies
Oh, it looks so good 'til it's in your hand
It's like one of those memories
Where you can't let go but you just can't stand
It's like one of those crazy dreams
And the permanent screens in the magazines
Saying, "Why'd I love
All it does is break your heart"

One morning does it all add up
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy
You're getting close to giving up
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie, live or die
I, well, I guess that's life

Like one of those people
With the beautiful eyes and the perfect face
It's like one of those stories
Where the hero dies in the very last race
Like one of those endless cries
And the crazy lies of a hurting child
Saying, "Why did love have to hurt
It broke my heart"

One morning does it all add up
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy
You're getting close to giving up
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie, live or die
I, well, I guess that's life

I always liked to think
That I was always brave enough
To try to master any push and shove
Well I guess I never qualified love

One morning does it all add up
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy
You're getting close to giving up
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie, live or die
I, well, I guess that's life
Oh, I guess that's life
Well, I guess that's life

"That's When"

[Taylor Swift]
You said, "I know"
When I said, "I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this"
You watched me go
And I knew my
Words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back
And I said, "When can I-I-I come back"

[Taylor Swift and Keith Urban]
And you said that's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when
Mm, mm

I said, "I know"
When you said, "I did you wrong
Made mistakes
And put you through all of this" (through all of this)
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said, "Leave those all in our past"
And you said, "When can I-I-I come back"

And I said, that's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when"

[Taylor Swift]
And you said, "Honestly
When you were gone
Did you ever think of me"
And I said

[Taylor Swift with Keith Urban]
"That's when, when I woke up in the morning
That's when, it was sunny or storming
Laughing when I was crying
And that's when, you were waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby, that's when"

That's when, when I wake up in the morning (Yeah)
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
When I'm laughing, when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
(That when I miss you, that's when I want you)
That's when, when I see your face
That's when I love you, that's when

"The Diary Of Me"

I'm a laid back
T-shirt, blue jean, mood ring
Kinda girl
Hey yeah what's the word on you
Lay low I'm a mission rebel
Angel devil
Little left of the middle
Sometimes I get temperamental

But here I am an open book
Turn the page it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

I'm poetry, complicated
Simply stated
Hey yeah baby how about you
I was born free
I'm a cell phone hippie
Are you with me
When I mess up I don't get up
I just get down yeah

But here I am an open book
Turn the page it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

It's raining on Sunday
There's nothing on TV
Yesterday was lonely
You're the only one who gets me
My mind is like an island
Drifting through the ocean
I can't stop thinking about you
I bet you're thinking of me too

Well here I am an open book
Turn the page it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me
Yeah here I am an open book
Turn the page it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

"There's Your Trouble"

Should have been different but
It wasn't different, was it
Same old story, dear John
And so long
Should have fit like a glove
Should have fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring
A token of true love
Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

There's your trouble
There's your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You can't see I love you
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

So now you're thinking 'bout
All you're missing how
Deep you're sinking
Round and round and dragging down
Why don't you cash in your chips
Why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss
Chalk it up better luck
Could have been true love
But it wasn't
It should all add up
But it doesn't

There's your trouble
There's your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You can't see I love you
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

There's your trouble
There's your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You can't see I love you
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

"Thirteen Blocks (Can't Call It Love)"

Stumble up the porch step
You sat down in the car
Only thirteen blocks across this town
To get to where you are
And that don't offer me much time
To make up my mind
So I best be driving slow
On my way to letting go

These headlights they just wanna fade
Off into the night
But if they're half as stubborn as me
They'll just keep on shining bright
I ain't ever been one to settle like
The dust does on the dash
Since the feeling ain't strong
I'll just move on
And leave this in my past

Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wonderin' 'bout how I'll feel the day
I see you find somebody new
So I've been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I'm gonna miss you bad but
Can't call it love if you ain't in it

Red light turns to green
Then back to red again
I wish there were some other travelers out here
To slow my travelling
Even though the wheel rolled on
Inside I still don't know
Oh and it troubles me so, oh

Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wonderin' 'bout how I'll feel the day
I see you found somebody new
And I've been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I might miss you bad but
Can't call it love if you ain't in it

Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how I'll feel today
I see you found somebody new
So I've been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I might miss you bad but
Can't call it love if you ain't in it

Your car comes to a rest in the drive
You open up the door and I see you smile

"This Here Guitar"

Walking downtown shuffling my feet
I try to dream my dreams above the concrete
Store windows, traveled for miles
But something I passed really caught my eye
It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars
But I fell in love with this here guitar

Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar

It was my baby, anyone could see
I love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty
But I can't help wondering why
It came to me and where we'll say goodbye
The cracks down the middle
Can't see where they are
Since I fell in love with this here guitar

Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar

Were you a present from a father to a son
Did he forget you
Or just play you 'til you came undone
Hey, did some prima donna love you
'Til she got her fame and fortune
I won't do that to you

Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar
You're my guitar
This here guitar

"This Is Really Happening"

Beneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows opened up
The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound
It's like I'm melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move
And

Tell me
You'll never leave me
And I'm not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

Could this be better
You write me letters
Though you see me every day
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights
It really blows me away

Lock me up in a dark room
And I still can't take my eyes off you

Tell me
You'll never leave me
And I'm not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

All those kisses up against your car
For all those wishes on planes
We thought were stars
Memories like photographs
Oh, baby, here we are

Tell me
You'll never leave me
And I'm not crazy and
Oh, this is really happening
Oh, oh, baby

Tell me
You'll always need me
That I drive you crazy
And this is really happening
Oh, that this is really happening

Tell me, oh
You'll always need me
(Need me, tell me)
(Baby)
That I drive you crazy
(Oh)
That this is really happening

You out clubbing but I just made caramel delight

It's a thug story, tell me can you handle that

[T-Pain and Taylor]
I had a dream last night

[Taylor Swift]
I had high-top Nikes

Diamonds in my mouth

I didn't even say anything

I didn't swear
(She didn't even swear)
Hello Ugh

"Til Brad Pitt Comes Along"

Do you remember the day
I leaned up against your car
And it started rolling down the street
You screamed and ran after it
And tried to open the door
And it ran over your foot
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
And I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

Do you remember the time we watched "Carrie"
And you said it reminded you of me
And I threw the remote at you
And you said, "My point exactly."
And later on that night, under the neon city lights
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you

And I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

You call me lucky 'cause I lose everything
But I swear I'd be careful with it
If you gave me a ring

And it would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
And I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't play our song
I wish that pretty girls wouldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along
'Til Brad Pitt comes along
Yeah, oh oh
Until Brad Pitt comes along

"Today Was A Fairytale"
(from "Valentine's Day" soundtrack)

Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey T-shirt
You told me I was pretty
When I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around

But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile that takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around

But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale

"Under My Head"

Are you trying to make me fall
'Cause with a face like that baby
It won't take too long
Keep on melting me with those eyes
And I think in a while I'll be hypnotized
Sitting here singing

Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

Baby somewhere around the time
The moment I saw you
With your hair all sticking up 
I was all caught up
'Cause baby you were so damn cute
I need you to need me 
See the train is coming for me
Help me, save me from this crash at last

Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

Na na na na na na na na na 
You seem to be just what I've tried to find
And your name looks so good written next to mine
Next to mine
Next to mine

Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh I really really want you
Oh, oh I love you I love you
Oh, oh.. 

Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

"Viva La Vida"

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead Long live the king"

One minute I held the keys
Next the doors were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever wanna be king

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

"Wait For Me"

If you had only gotten to me first
If I could write a book on how this hurts
If you could see the way your smile looks to me

If I wasn't scared of the world alone
If I didn't know he loves me so
If I could only find the strength to leave
You'd be with me, so baby

Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me

As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me

It's so wrong that all I wanna do
Is forget it all and just be with you
I have to go 'cause he don't know
But the writing's on the wall

But here we are in so deep
Soaking wet
Jumping in without no safety net
And I don't know what kinda ropes
Would break this kinda fall, so baby

Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go, I hope you think of me

As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait, wait for me

We can't be together right now
Guess there's no use in trying
But if you look at me right now
Can you tell that I'm dying
To hold you
But it would be wrong to

So don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me

Don't you look now
Don't you look now
I might fall in love
Don't you look now

"We Were Happy"

We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy

I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy

When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happy

When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

Oh, I hate those voices
Telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices
And that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy

We were happy

When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
When we were happy

Yeah, we were were happy
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We were happy

"Welcome Distraction"

I got a little thing I call self control
'Cause I get a little crazy
When I let too much go
Love's a little messy and you are too
Right now I'm scared of both of you
I laugh and I play and I wasn't gonna stray
Swore I'd never let a man in my way

You're the last thing I needed today

And I don't know
Where I lost control
And couldn't take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can't win so I give in
The more I fight it just gets stronger
You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction

Gone and spilled my coffee
Tryna get to the phone
'Cause it might be you
You just never know
Can't talk to my friends
Without you coming up
It's even kind of cute
The way you cuss
I wrote your name down
A hundred thousand times
'Cause it looks so good
Right next to mine

You're the last thing I needed tonight

And I don't know
Where I lost control
And couldn't take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can't win so I give in
The more I fight it just gets stronger
You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction

I'm acting like a girl
With nothing to lose
When did I stop caring
About anything but you

And I don't know
Where I lost control
And couldn't take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can't win so I give in
The more I fight it just gets stronger
You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction

Welcome distraction, welcome distraction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction oh oh

"What Do You Say"

What do you say, when you just know
That he's the one, and you wanna go fast
But he's taking it slow
And what do you do, when he's next to you
But he's a little bit shy
Well here's something you can try

Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say

What do you see, when you look in his eyes
There's something there
That he can't disguise
No matter how he tries
And what do you feel, when you know it's real
And you can't sit still
If you don't own up will yeah

Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say

My imagination's running away
Just dreaming about
What I want you to say

Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday

What do you say
What do you say

"What To Wear"

She's looking in the mirror
The moment's getting nearer
She thinks about it as she walks her walk
Up and down the staircase
Make up fresh on her face
She thinks about it as she talks her talk

School dance, first chance
Always been a dreamer
There's one guy, she's shy
Sees him through the mirror
And everybody looks at her
She thinks about it

Blue dress, angel face
Looking in the mirror
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air

Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wondering what to wear

She's standing in her bedroom
He'll be pulling up soon
She thinks about it when she sees headlights
Looking out the window
She's got her diary to show
That she's been waiting for this all her life

First date, can't wait
Looking in the mirror
Heart all wrapped up
Wait until he sees her
He's looking right at her
She thinks about it

Sixteen blue jeans, Abercrombie T-shirt
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air

Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wondering what to wear

The years went by
The mirror saw her cry
She got up again
She got up again
The wind blew by
The small town lights
She got up again

Move out, find out
Where the world can take her
Bright lights, late nights
Living for the greater
Move to Paris
Living on a prayer

Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wondering what to wear

Ohh, oh, oh
Wondering what to wear

"Who I've Always Been"

You walk in here with your guitar man
Your shiny boots and your full on band
A smile on your face, a knife in your hand
Singing songs you've got memorized
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your hands

But don't worry yourself I ain't your competition
But don't flatter yourself that was never my intention

I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you in an empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you wanna be and who I've always been

I walk in here with a beat up case
The same guitar I've always played
And the words I wrote down on a page
When I was 12 years old a small town raised
You tell the crowd you're paying dues
I tell them, "This is what I do."
And it's what I put my life into
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume

And say life on musical road is rough conditions
Oh but the easy ride was never my ambition

I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you in an empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you wanna be and who I've always been

Let's talk about your childhood days
You were the prom queen, I was on this stage
So where's that crown gotten you these days
When it's me and you and the same damn games

So what have you got that I ain't
And what can you do that I can't
Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about who you wanna be, girl, and who I've always been

"Writing Songs About You"

I can't believe you did it again
Walked by and took my heart with you
Why'd you have to look so good
Don't you know I'm trying to hate you
Trying to have a dream without you in it
But how can I put out this fire
When you're the one who lit it

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really OK when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be over you for real
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

I've got a stack of papers so high
And it's all about you baby
Keep thinking maybe I
Can make sense of something crazy
Something I can't get out of my Head
I write your name I write your name
Then I tear it all to shreds

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really OK when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be over you for real
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

And if you ever change your mind
And want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me
Why I shouldn't let you in

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really OK 'cause I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be over you for real
'Til I do

I'll just wait for the day
I stop pretending
That I'm really OK when I'm not
Wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
'Til I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

"You Do"

Here I am, once again
In your driveway, thinking I should be leaving
I should go but it's so entertaining watching you breathing
You went and got to me like
The stupid song on the radio that you try to forget
But it sticks in your head
So goodbye, it's not goodnight
Cause I'll be seeing you in my dreamin'

Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my friends, tell them all about you
Always looking like a one of those nights
When you're thinkin' about a kiss 'til the morning light
You got me, you do

In a daze, pull the shades
Close my eyes and picture you at my window
I relax I go back to all the things you said
That only I know

Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my all my friends, tell them all about you
Always looking like a one of those nights
When you're thinkin' about a kiss 'til the morning light
You got me, you do

I run right out to my car
And I pull out the drive
It's only been ten minutes
But I have to see you one more time

Cause you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin' so bad, I spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my all my friends, tell them all about you
And it's looking like a one of those nights
When you're thinkin' about a kiss 'til the morning light
You got me, you do
Oh, you got me, you do

"Your Anything"

I bet you lie awake at night
Trying to make up your sweet mind
Wondering if you'll ever find
Just what you want
A home-town number one
Or a California loaded gun
But you know you only get one
Or that's what you thought
But here's what you've got

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything

If you want hard to get
If you want
All you have to do is let me know
If you want a bumpy ride
Or someone with a softer side
Either one'll be alright
Just let me know
'Cause this is where it goes

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything

It's not like I'm giving up who I am for you
But for someone like you it's just so easy to do

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need

If that's what you need

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything

"Your Face"

I heard a song tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
She sees his face
In every space
Every room

And I know if I turn around you won't be there
If I close my eyes will you be there

I don't wanna lose your face
And I don't wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't wanna turn around
'Cause I'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I don't wanna lose your face

I've got a picture of you in my bedroom
And I hope it never falls
I hope I never lose that feeling
I used to get when you would call

And now I wonder to myself
Who were you Where are you
Were you ever here at all

I don't wanna lose your face
And I don't wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't wanna turn around
'Cause I'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I don't wanna lose your face

That girl in the song had it so good
I wish I could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And I had you

I don't wanna lose your face
I don't wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't wanna turn around
'Cause I'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I don't wanna lose your face

I don't wanna lose your face
I don't wanna turn around

"Bravado"

All my life
I've been fighting a war
I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you
My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to
This will not do

'Cause I was raised up
To be admired to be noticed
But when you're withdrawn it's the closest thing
To assault when all eyes are on you
This will not do

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm faking glory
Lick my lips toss my hair
And turn the smile on
And the story's brand-new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado

It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipsed, whoa
And I can tell you that when the lights come on I'll be ready for this

It's in your bloodstream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scale without thinking of size

I was frightened of every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me

But I learnt not to want
The quiet of the room with no one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval, the things that make me go

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipsed, whoa
And I can tell you that when the lights come on I'll be ready for this

It's in your blood stream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run or a mountain you scale without thinking of size

I was frightened of every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me

But I learnt not to want
The quiet of the room with no one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval, the things that make me go

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

"Royals"

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
We didn't come from money

But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

Ooh ooh oh
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen
Ooh ooh oh
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

"Million Dollar Bills"

There's nothing I want
But money and time
Million dollar bills
And the tick-tick-tick-tick
There's nothing more cruel
Than only nine lives
Unlimited spines
Would do the trick-trick-trick-trick

We could leave the house, leave the party, let the people know
Go drown the colours of our minds and watch the cars go

There's nothing as fun
As coming untied
And running with the kids
In the park-park-park-park
There's nothing that's hurt
Like letting you go
It's like a bird
Eyes
In the dark-dark-dark-dark

We could leave the house, lead the party, let the people know
Go drown the colours of our minds and watch the cars go
It's not about just bein' out with the right people
'Cause we can get in trouble just by going free-flow

And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know

"The Love Club"

I'm in a clique but I want out
It's not the same as when I was punched
In the old days, there was enough
The card games and knees with the bitter salt of blood
I was in, but I want out
My mother's love is choking me
I'm sick of words that hang above my head
"What about the kid" It's time the kid got free

Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

I joined the club and it's all on
There are fights for being my best friend
And the girls get their claws out
There's something about hanging out with the wicked kids
Take the pill, make it too real
The other day I forgot my old address
I'm sitting pretty on the throne
There's nothing more I want
Except to be alone

Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

(For the love club)
(For the love club)
(For the love club)

Your clothes are soaked and you don't know where to go
So drop your chin and take yourself back home
And roll out your maps and papers
Find out your hiding places again
The only problem that I got with the club
Is how you're severed from the people
Who watched you grow up
When you're a member
Go on your great adventure again
And we'll be waiting at the end

Be a part of the love club
Everything will glow for you
Go get punched for the love club
For the love club

(For the love club)
(For the love club)
(For the love club)
(For the love club)

"Biting Down"

It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down

Skip a hit, don't make a sound
(It feels better biting down)
Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown
(It feels better biting down)
Listen to the beats resound
(It feels better biting down)
It feels better biting down
(It feels better biting down)

It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down

Skip a hit, don't make a sound
(It feels better biting down)
Breathed so deep I thought I'd drown
(It feels better biting down)
Listen to the beats resound
It feels better biting down
It feels better biting down

The electronics of your heart
See how fast they fall apart
(It feels better biting down)
The electronics of your heart
See how fast they fall apart
(It feels better biting down)
It feels better biting down

Skip a hit, don't make a sound

"Bravado (Fffrrannno Remix)"

All my life
I've been fighting a war
I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you
My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to
This will not do
'Cause I was raised up
To be admired, to be noticed
But when you're withdrawn
It's the closest thing
To assault when all eyes are on you
This will not do

I'm faking glory
Lick my lips, toss my hair
And turn the smile on
And the story's brand new
But I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado

It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipse, whoa
And I can tell you that
When the lights come on, I'll be ready for this
It's in your bloodstream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run
Or a mountain you scaled without thinking of size

I was frightened of
Every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me, but
I learned not to want
The quiet of a room with no-one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval
The things that make me go, "Oh"

It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back, it's a moon eclipse, whoa
And I can tell you that
When the lights come on, I'll be ready for this
It's in your bloodstream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run
Or a mountain you scaled without thinking of size

I was frightened of
Every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me, but
I learned not to want
The quiet of a room with no-one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval
The things that make me go, "Oh"

"Tennis Court"

Don't you think that it's boring how people talk
Making smart with their words again, well I'm bored
Because I'm doing this for the thrill of it, killin' it
Never not chasing a million things I want
And I am only as young as the minute is full of it
Getting pumped up on the little bright things I bought
But I know they'll never own me
(Yeah)

Baby be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah)

Pretty soon I'll be getting on my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
But my head's filling up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again, when I'm known
And my boys trip me up with their heads again, loving them
Everything's cool when we're all in line for the throne
But I know it's not forever
(Yeah)

Baby be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah)

It looked alright in the pictures (yeah)

Getting caught's half of the trip though, isn't it
I fall apart with all my heart (yeah)
And you could watch from your window (yeah)
[Laughs]
And you can watch from your window

Baby be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form showing people how little we care (yeah)
We're so happy, even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah)

And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
And talk it up like yeah (yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court, and talk it up like yeah
(Yeah)

"400 Lux"

We're never done with killing time
Can I kill it with you
'Til the veins run red and blue
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do
Let me kill it with you

You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow, but we're brave

And I like you
I love these roads where the houses don't change (and I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say (and I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway (and I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed

Now we're wearing long sleeves and the heating comes on
(You buy me orange juice)
We're getting good at this
Dreams of clean teeth
I can tell that you're tired
But you keep the car on
While you're waiting out front

You pick me up and take me home again
Head out the window again
We're hollow like the bottles that we drain
You drape your wrists over the steering wheel
Pulses can drive from here
We might be hollow, but we're brave

And I like you
I love these roads where the houses don't change (and I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say (and I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway (and I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed

We're never done with killing time
Can I kill it with you
'Til the veins run red and blue
We come around here all the time
Got a lot to not do
Let me kill it with you

And I like you
I love these roads where the houses don't change (and I like you)
Where we can talk like there's something to say (and I like you)
I'm glad that we stopped kissing the tar on the highway (and I like you)
We move in the tree streets
I'd like it if you stayed

And I like you
And I like you
And I like you

"Royals"

I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In a torn-up town, no postcode envy

But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

My friends and I, we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
We didn't come from money

But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

Ooh ooh oh
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love with being queen
Ooh ooh oh
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler)
You can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
Let me live that fantasy

"Ribs"

The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy getting old

We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good, how you wish it would be all the time

The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy getting old

The drink you spilt all over me
"Lover's Spit" left on repeat
My mum and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy getting old

This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary getting old

We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good, how you wish it would be all the time

This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
Feels so scary getting old

This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
Feels so scary getting old

I want them back (I want them back)
The minds we had (the minds we had)
How all the thoughts (how all the thoughts)
Moved 'round our heads (moved 'round our heads)

I want them back (I want them back)
The minds we had (the minds we had)
It's not enough to feel the lack (I want them back, I want them back)
I want 'em

You're the only friend I need (you're the only friend I need)
Sharing beds like little kids (sharing beds like little kids)
And laughing 'til our ribs get tough (and laughing 'til our ribs get tough)
But that will never be enough (but that will never be enough)

You're the only friend I need (you're the only friend I need)
Sharing beds like little kids (sharing beds like little kids)
And laughing 'til our ribs get tough (and laughing 'til our ribs get tough)
But that will never be enough (but that will never be enough)

That will never be enough
That will never be enough

"Buzzcut Season"

I remember when your head caught flame
It kissed your scalp and caressed your brain
(I remember when your head caught flame)
Well, you laughed, baby, it's OK
It's buzzcut season, anyway
(Well, you laughed, baby, it's OK)

Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good

We ride the bus with the knees pulled in
People should see how we're living
(We ride the bus with the knees pulled in)
Shut my eyes to the song that plays
Sometimes this has a hot, sweet taste
(Shut my eyes to the song that plays)

The men up on the news
They try to tell us all that we will lose
But it's so easy in this blue
Where everything is good

And I'll never go home again
(Place the call, feel it start)
Favorite friend
(And nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
We're all the things that we do for fun
(And I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along
(Make-believe, it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you

Cola with the burnt-out taste
I'm the one you tell your fears to
There'll never be enough of us

Explosions on TV
And all the girls with heads inside a dream
So now we live beside the pool
Where everything is good

And I'll never go home again
(Place the call, feel it start)
Favorite friend
(And nothing's wrong when nothing's true)
I live in a hologram with you
We're all the things that we do for fun
(And I'll breathe, and it goes)
Play along
(Make-believe, it's hyper real)
But I live in a hologram with you

"Team"

Wait till you're announced
We've not yet lost all our graces
The hounds will stay in chains
Look upon Your Greatness and she'll
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out
Send the call out, send the call out

Call all the ladies out
They're in their finery
A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother
While he glows through the room

Dancin' around the lies we tell
Dancin' around big eyes, as well
Even the comatose
They don't dance and tell

We live in cities you'll never see on-screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there

So all the cups got broke
Shards beneath our feet
But it wasn't my fault
And everyone's competing
For a love they won't receive
'Cause what this palace wants is release

We live in cities you'll never see on-screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

I'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air
So there
I'm kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care
So there

We live in cities you'll never see on-screen
Not very pretty, but we sure know how to run things
Livin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams
And you know, we're on each other's team

We're on each other's team
And you know, we're on each other's team
We're on each other's team
And you know, and you know, and you know

"Glory And Gore"

There's a humming in the restless summer air
And we're slipping off the course that we prepared
But in all chaos, there is calculation
Dropping glasses just to hear them break
You've been drinking like the world was gonna end (it didn't)
Took a shiner from the fist of your best friend (go figure)
It's clear that someone's gotta go
We mean it but I promise we're not mean

And the cry goes out
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out 
Now we're in the ring
And we're coming for blood

(Oh Oh)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But we're the gladiators (Oh Oh)
Everyone a rager (oh-oh)
But secretly they're saviors
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines (Oh Oh)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But victory's contagious

Delicate in every way but one (the swordplay)
God knows we like archaic kinds of fun (the old way)
Chance is the only game I play with, baby
We let our battles choose us

And the cry goes out
They lose their minds for us
And how it plays out 
Now we're in the ring
And we're coming for blood

(Oh Oh)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But we're the gladiators (Oh Oh)
Everyone a rager (oh-oh)
But secretly they're saviors
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines (Oh Oh)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But victory's contagious

No-one round here's good at keeping their eyes closed
The sun's starting to light up when we're walking home
Tired little laughs, gold-lie promises we'll always win at this
I don't ever think about death
It's alright if you do, it's fine
We gladiate but I guess we're really fighting ourselves
Roughing up our minds so we're ready when the kill time comes
Wide awake in bed, words in my brain, 
"Secretly you love this do you even wanna go free"
Let me in the ring, I'll show you what that big word means

(Oh Oh)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But we're the gladiators (Oh Oh)
Everyone a rager (oh-oh)
But secretly they're saviors
Glory and gore go hand in hand
That's why we're making headlines (Oh Oh)
You could try and take us (oh-oh)
But victory's contagious

"Still Sane"

Today is my birthday, and I'm riding high
Hair is dripping, hiding that I'm terrified
But this is summer, playing dumber than in fall

Everything I say falls right back
Into everything I'm not
In the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet

Riding around on the bikes, we're still sane
I won't be her, tripping over on-stage
Hey, it's all cool, I still like hotels, but I think that'll change
Still like hotels, and my newfound fame
Hey, promise I can stay good

(Everything feels right)
I'm little, but I'm coming for the crown
I'm little, but I'm coming for you
(Chase paper, get by)
I'm little but I'm coming for the title
Held by everyone who's up

All work and no play
Never made me lose it
All business all day
Keeps me up a level
All work and no play
Keeps me on the new shit, yeah

All work and no play
Let me count the bruises
All business all day
Keeps me up a level
All work and no play
Lonely on that new shit, yeah, yeah

Only bad people live to see their likeness set in stone
Only bad people live to see their likeness set in stone
What does that make me

I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet

I'm not in the swing of things
But what I really mean is
Not in the swing of things yet

All work and no play
Never made me lose it
All business all day
Keeps me up a level

All work and no play
Keeps me on the new shit, yeah

"White Teeth Teens"

We wouldn't be seen dead here in the day
I guess you're lucky that it's dark now
And if I like it then we'll stay
Impress the empress, take a shot now

We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are up for it

I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this

If you want we'll help tonight to split its seams
Give the bruises out like gifts
You'll get the picture of your dreams
I won't be smiling
But the notes from my admirers
Fill the dashboard just the same

We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are up for it

I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop us when we're up for it
I know you love it when the hairpins start to drop
I like your reckoning
But we got our methods and there's nothing here to stop
To stop this

[Repeat in background]
And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could

I'll let you in on something big
I am not a white teeth teen
I tried to join but never did
The way they are, the way they seem is something else, it's in the blood
Their molars blinking like the lights, in the underpass where we all sit
And do nothing
And love it

[Repeat in background]
And everything works out so good
I wear the robe like no one could

We got the glow in our mouths
White teeth teens are out
White teeth teens are out

"A World Alone"

That slow burn wait while it gets dark, bruising the sun
I feel grown up with you in your car, I know it's dumb

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

We've both got a million bad habits to kick, not sleeping is one
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip, I'm biting my tongue

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
People are talking, people are talking (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
People are talking, people are talking

Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone, world alone, we're alone

All my fake friends and all of their noise, complain about work
They're studying business, I study the floor, and you haven't stopped smoking all night
Maybe the Internet raised us, or maybe people are jerks
(People are talking, people are talking)
But not you
(People are talking, people are talking)

Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone, world alone, we're alone

All the double-edged people and schemes
They make a mess then go home and get clean
You're my best friend, and we're dancing in a world alone, a world alone, we're alone

I know we're not everlasting
We're a train wreck waiting to happen
One day the blood won't flow so gladly
One day we'll all get still
(People are talking, people are talking)
(People are talking, people are talking)
Get still
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
People are talking, people are talking (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
People are talking, people are talking
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
People are talking, people are talking (ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
People are talking, people are talking

Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk 'cause we're dancing in this world alone, world alone, we're alone

All the double-edged people and schemes
They make a mess then go home and get clean
You're my best friend and we're dancing in a world alone, a world alone, we're alone

People are talking, people are talking
People are talking, people are talking
People are talking, people are talking
People are talking, people are talking

Let 'em talk

"Green Light"

I do my make-up in somebody else's car
We order different drinks at the same bars
I know about what you did and I wanna scream the truth
She thinks you love the beach, you're such a damn liar
(Liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar)

Well, those great whites, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love, no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light-up floor
On the light-up floor

But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But, honey, I'll be seein' you 'ever I go
But, honey, I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

'Cause, honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

Sometimes I wake up in a different bedroom
I whisper things, the city sings them back to you

Well, those rumours, they have big teeth
Hope they bite you
Thought you said that you would always be in love
But you're not in love, no more
Did it frighten you
How we kissed when we danced on the light-up floor
On the light-up floor

But I hear sounds in my mind
Brand new sounds in my mind
But, honey, I'll be seein' you 'ever I go
But, honey, I'll be seein' you down every road
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

'Cause, honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

Yeah, honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
Oh, I wish I could get my things and just let go
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it
I'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it

"Sober"

Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
Night, midnight, lose my mind
(When you get to my high, when you get to my)
Night, midnight

Oh, God, I'm clean out of air in my lungs
It's all gone
Played it so nonchalant
It's time we danced with the truth
Move alone with the truth
Ooh (hey)
We're sleeping through all the days
I'm acting like I don't see
Every ribbon you used to tie yourself to me

But my hips have missed your hips
So, let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me
Go astray with me
(Ah ha)

We're King and Queen of the weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober)
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care
But we care
(But what will we do when we're sober)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober)

Oh, God, I'm closing my teeth
Around this liquor-wet lime
Midnight, lose my mind
I know you're feeling it too
Can we keep up with the ruse
Ah ah (hey)
B-bodies all through my house
I know this story by heart
Jack and Jill get fucked up and possessive
When it get dark

But my hips have missed your hips
So, let's get to know the kicks
Will you sway with me
Go astray with me
(Ah ha)

We're King and Queen of the Weekend
Ain't a pill that could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober)
These are the games of the weekend
We pretend that we just don't care
But we care
(But what will we do when we're sober)
When you dream with a fever
Bet you wish you could touch our rush
(But what will we do when we're sober)

Midnight, we're fading
'Til daylight, we're jaded
We know that it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with all the heartache
And the treason, the fantasies of leaving
But we know that, when it's over
In the morning, you'll be dancing with us
(Midnight, lose my mind, midnight, lose my mind)
Oh, dancing with us
(But what will we do when we're sober)
Oh, you'll be dancing with us
(Can you feel it Can you feel it)
Dancing with us, us
(But what will we do when we're sober)
Us

When you get to my high (midnight, lose my mind)
When you get to my (midnight, lose my mind)

"Homemade Dynamite"

A couple rebel Top Gun pilots
Flying with nowhere to be
Don't know you super well
But I think that you might be the same as me
Behave abnormally

Let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side
Tell you all my best lies
Yeah, awesome right
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side
Tell you all my best lies
Seeing me rolling, showing someone else love
Dancing with our shoes off
Know I think you're awesome, right

Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

Might get your friend to drive
But he can hardly see
We'll end up painted on the road
Red and chrome, all the broken glass sparkling
I guess we're partying

So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side
Tell you all my best lies
See me rolling, showing someone else love
Hands under your T-shirt
Know I think you're awesome, right

Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

Now you know it's really gonna blow (boo)

Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowing shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

"The Louvre"

Well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
Our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
Half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard
I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough
I overthink your p-punctuation use
Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do

A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame
All that you're doing
Can you hear the violence
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

Our thing progresses, I call and you come through
Blow all my friendships to sit in hell with you
But we're the greatest, they'll hang us in the Louvre
Down the back, but who cares Still the Louvre
Okay, I know that you are not my type (Still I fall)
I'm just the sucker who let you fill her mind (But what about love)
Nothing wrong with it, supernatural
Just move in close to me, closer, you'll feel it coasting

A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame
All that you're doing
Can you hear the violence
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it

"Liability"

Go for it
One, two

Baby really hurt me
Crying in the taxi
He don't wanna know me
Says he made the big mistake of dancing in my storm
Says it was poison
So I guess I'll go home
Into the arms of the girl that I love
The only love I haven't screwed up
She's so hard to please
But she's a forest fire
I do my best to meet her demands
Play at romance, we slow dance
In the living room, but all that a stranger would see
Is one girl swaying alone
Stroking her cheek

They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for
E-a-na-na-na, everyone

The truth is I am a toy
That people enjoy
'Til all of the tricks don't work anymore
And then they are bored of me
I know that it's exciting
Running through the night, but
Every perfect summer's
Eating me alive until you're gone
Better on my own

They say, "You're a little much for me
You're a liability
You're a little much for me"
So they pull back, make other plans
I understand, I'm a liability
Get you wild, make you leave
I'm a little much for
E-a-na-na-na, everyone

They're gonna watch me
Disappear into the sun
You're all gonna watch me
Disappear into the sun

"Hard Feelings  Loveless"

[Hard Feelings]

Go back and tell it

Please, could you be tender
And I will sit close to you
Let's give it a minute before we admit that we're through
Guess this is the winter
Our bodies are young and blue
I'm at Jungle City, it's late and this song is for you

'Cause I remember the rush, when forever was us
Before all of the winds of regret and mistrust
Now we sit in your car and our love is a ghost
Well, I guess I should go, yeah, I guess I should go

Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When sweet words and fevers
All leave us right here in the cold, oh, oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God, I wish I believed ya
When you told me this was my home, oh, oh

I light all the candles
Cut flowers for all my rooms
I care for myself the way I used to care about you
These days, we kiss and we keep busy
The waves come after midnight
I call from underwater
Why even try to get right
When you've outgrown a lover (Oh)
The whole world knows but you (Oh)
It's time to let go of this endless summer afternoon

Hard feelings
These are what they call hard feelings of love
When sweet words and fevers
All leave us right here in the cold, oh, oh
Alone with the hard feelings of love
God, I wish I believed ya
When you told me this was my home, oh, oh

Three years, loved you every single day
Made me weak, it was real for me, yeah, real for me
Now I'll fake it every single day
'Til I don't need fantasy, 'til I feel you leave
But I still remember everything
How we'd drift buying groceries, how you'd dance for me
I'll start letting go of little things
'Til I'm so far away from you, far away from you, yeah

[Loveless]

"What is this tape"
"This is my favorite tape"

Bet you wanna rip my heart out
Bet you wanna skip my calls now
Well, guess what I'd like that
'Cause I'm gonna mess your life up
Gonna wanna tape my mouth shut
Look out, lovers

We're L-O-V-E-L-E-S-S generation

"Sober II (Melodrama)"

You asked if I was feeling it, I'm psycho high
Know you won't remember in the morning when I speak my mind
Lights are on and they've gone home, but who am I
Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses
We told you this was melodrama
(Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)
Our only wish is melodrama
(Oh, how fast the evening passes
Cleaning up the champagne glasses)

And the terror and the horror
When we wonder why we bother, whoa, whoa
And the terror and the horror
God, I wonder why we bother, whoa, whoa
All the glamour and the trauma
And the fuckin' melodrama, whoa, whoa
All the gun fights and the lime lights
And the holy sick divine nights, whoa
(Holy sick divine nights, whoa)
They'll talk about us, all the lovers
How we kiss and kill each other, whoa
They'll talk about us, and discover
How we kissed and killed each other, whoa
(And we'll tell them)

We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offer
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offer
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offer
We told you this was melodrama
You wanted something that we offer

We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama
We told you this was melodrama

"Writer In The Dark"

Break the newsyou're walking out
To be a good man for someone else
Sorry I was never good like you
Stood on my chest and kept me down
Hated hearing my name on the lips of a crowd
Did my best to exist just for you

Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe

I still feel you, now and then
Slow like pseudo-ephedrine
When you see me, will you say I've changed
I ride the subway, read the signs
I let the seasons change my mind
I love it here since I've stopped needing you

Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe

I am my mother's child, I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours, I stumbled on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe

"Supercut"

In my head
I play a supercut of us
All the magic we gave off
All the love we had and lost
And in my head
The visions never stop
These ribbons wrap me up
But when I reach for you
There's just a supercut

In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
We keep trying to talk about us
I'm someone you maybe might love
I'll be your quiet afternoon crush
Be your violent overnight rush
Make you crazy over my touch

But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh, it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us

So I fall
Into continents and cars
All the stages and the stars
I turn all of it
To just a supercut

'Cause in my head (In my head, I do everything right)
When you call (When you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours are the moments I play in the dark
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh

In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
We keep trying to talk about us
Slow motion, I'm watching our love
I'll be your quiet afternoon crush
Be your violent overnight rush
Make you crazy over my touch

But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh, it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
But it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us
Oh, it's just a supercut of us
Supercut of us

'Cause in my head, in my head, I do everything right
When you call, I'll forgive and not fight
All the moments I play in the dark
Wild, fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh
'Cause in my head (In my head, I do everything right)
When you call (When you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours are the moments I play in the dark
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh
'Cause in my head (In my head, I do everything right)
When you call (When you call, I'll forgive and not fight)
Because ours are the moments I play in the dark
We were wild and fluorescent, come home to my heart, uh

In my head, I do everything right
In my head, I do everything right

"Liability (Reprise)"

I'm a liability, I'm a liability
Much for me
You're a little much for me, no, no, no, no
And what ya gonna do Whoa

All of the dreams that get harder
All of the things that I offer you, ay
And all of the shit that we harbour
Make all of the kids in the choirs sing, "Woo-hoo"
And maybe all this is the party
Maybe the tears and the highs we breathe, oh no
And maybe all this is the party
Maybe we just do it violently

But you're not what you thought you were
But you're not what you thought you were
(Liability) But you're not what you thought you were
(Much for me) But you're not what you thought you were
Leave

"Perfect Places"

Every night, I live and die
Feel the party to my bones
Watch the wasters blow the speakers
Spill my guts beneath the outdoor light
It's just another graceless night
I hate the headlines and the weather
I'm 19 and I'm on fire
But when we're dancing, I'm alright
It's just another graceless night

Are you lost enough
Have another drink, get lost in us
This is how we get notorious, oh
'Cause I don't know
If they keep tellin' me where to go
I'll blow my brains out to the radio, oh-oh-oh

Ch, ch

All of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places

Every night, I live and die
Meet somebody, take 'em home
Let's kiss and then take off our clothes
It's just another graceless night

'Cause all of the things we're taking
'Cause we are young and we're ashamed
Send us to perfect places
All of our heroes fading
Now I can't stand to be alone
Let's go to perfect places

All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places, anyway
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places, anyway
All the nights spent off our faces
Trying to find these perfect places
What the fuck are perfect places, anyway

"The Path"

Born in the year of OxyContin
Raised in the tall grass
Teen millionaire having nightmares from the camera flash
Now I'm alone on a windswept island
Caught in the complex divorce of the seasons
Won't take the call if it's the label or the radio
Ahh
Ahh

Arm in a cast at the museum gala
Fork in my purse to take home to my mother
Supermodels all dancing 'round a pharaoh's tomb

Now if you're looking for a savior, well that's not me
You need someone to take your pain for you
Well, that's not me
'Cause we're all broken and sad
Where are the dreams that we had
Can't find the dreams that we had
Ah, ah, ah
Let's hope the sun will show us the path
Let's hope the sun will show us the path
Ah, ah, ah
I just hope the sun will show us the path
Savior is not me
I just hope the sun will show us the path
Savior is not me
I just hope the sun will show us the path
Path, path

"Solar Power"

I hate the winter
Can't stand the cold
I tend to cancel all the plans
(So sorry, I can't make it)
But when the heat comes
Something takes a hold
Can I kick it
Yeah, I can

My cheeks in high color, overripe peaches
No shirt, no shoes, only my features
My boy behind me, he's taking pictures
Lead the boys and girls onto the beaches
Come one, come all, I'll tell you my secrets
I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus

Forget all of the tears
That you've cried
It's over (Over)
(Over, over, over)
It's a new state of mind
Are you coming, my baby

Acid green
Aquamarine
The girls are dancing
In the sand
And I throw my cellular device
In the water
Can you reach me
No, you can't (Aha)

My cheeks in high color, overripe peaches
No shirt, no shoes, only my features
My boy behind me, he's taking pictures
(He's taking pictures)
Lead the boys and girls onto the beaches
Come one, come all, I'll tell you my secrets
I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus

Turn it on
In a new kind of bright
It's solar (Solar)
(Solar, solar, solar)
Come on and let the bliss begin
Blink three times when you feel it kickin' in

That solar-olar
Olar power
Solar-olar
Olar power
Solar-olar
Olar power
Solar-olar
Olar power
Solar-olar
Olar power
Solar-olar
Olar power

"California"

Once upon a time in Hollywood when Carole called my name
I stood up, the room exploded and I knew that's it, I'll never be the same
That's when the doors swung open and a voice said, "We're glad you came"
Now I've spent thousands on you darling, all the hotels and the jets
And I'd pay it all again to have your golden body back in my bed
But I don't miss the poison arrows aimed directly at my head

Goodbye to all the bottles
All the models
Bye to the clouds in the skies that all hold no rain-
(Don't want that California love)
(Don't want that California love)
(Don't want that California love)

Once upon a time the Canyon Store was where my world began
All that mystery and beauty gleaned from desert flowers and gifted children
But it got hard to grow up with your cool hand around my neck
Now in my hometown, sunbathing
My girlfriends, and my baby
But every time I smell tequila, the garden grows up in my mind again

Goodbye to all the bottles
All the models
Bye to the kids in the lines for the new Supreme-
(Don't want that California love)
(Don't want that California love)
(Don't want that California love)
(Don't want that California love)
(Don't want that California love)
(Don't want that California love)

It's just a dream
It's just a dream
It's all just a dream
I wanna wake up, I wanna wake up

"Stoned At The Nail Salon"

Got a wishbone drying on the windowsill in my kitchen
Just in case I wake up and realise I've chosen wrong
I love this life that I have
The vine hanging over the door
And the dog who comes when I call
But I wonder sometimes what I'm missing

Well, my hot blood's been burning for so many summers now
It's time to cool it down
Wherever that leads

'Cause all the beautiful girls, they will fade like the roses
And all the times, they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again

Got a memory of waiting in your bed wearing only my earrings
We'd go dancing all over the landmines under our town
But the sun has to rise
When it does, we'll divide up the papers
Two former hell-raisers
I'm still crazy for you, babe

Well, my hot blood's been burning for so many summers now
It's time to cool it down
Wherever that leads

'Cause all the music you loved at sixteen, you'll grow out of
And all the times, they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybe I'm just
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again

Oh, make it good
Oh, make it good
I'd ride and I'd ride on the carousel
'Round and 'round forever if I could
But it's time to cool it down
Whatever that means

Spend all the evenings you can with the people who raised you
'Cause all the times they will change, it'll all come around
I don't know
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon
Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again

"Fallen Fruit"

To the ones who came before us
All the golden ones who were lifted on a wing
We had no idea the dreams we had were far too big
Far too big

And we will walk together (We will walk)
Psychedelic garlands in our hair
Through the halls of splendour where the apple trees all grew
You'll leave us dancing on the fallen fruit
(The fallen fruit)
The fallen fruit (Ooh)
(The fallen fruit)

From the Nissan to the Phantom to the plane
We'll disappear in the cover of the rain
Took the great minds and the vapers
And a pocketful of seed
It's time for us to leave

And we will walk together (We will walk)
Psychedelic garlands in our hair
But how can I love what I know I am gonna lose
Don't make me choose

(The fallen fruit)
(The fallen fruit)
(The fallen fruit)

"Secrets From A Girl (Who's Seen It All)"

Dancing with my girls, only having two drinks then leaving
It's a funny thing, thought you'd never gain self-control
Guess it's been a while since you last said sorry
Crying in the dark at your best friends' parties
You've had enough, gotta turn the lights up, go home

Couldn't wait to turn fifteen
Then you blink and it's been ten years
Growing up a little at a time then all at once
Everybody wants the best for you
But you gotta want it for yourself
My love

You can take 'em if you want 'em, these are just
Secrets from a girl, who's seen it all
Secrets from a girl, who's seen it
Secrets from a girl
Secrets from a girl, who's seen it
Secrets from a girl (Secrets from a girl)
Secrets from a girl, who's seen it all

'Member all the hurt you would feel when you weren't desired
(Doing anything for more touch)
'Member what you thought was grief before you got the call
Baby girl, no one's gonna feel the pain for you
You're gonna love again, so just try staying open
And when the time comes, you'll fall
Yeah, when the time comes, you'll fall

Your dreams and inner visions, all your mystical ambitions
They won't let you down
Do your best to trust all the rays of light
Everybody wants the best for you
But you gotta want it for yourself
My love

Couldn't wait to turn fifteen, then you just go
(Whoosh)
Secrets from a girl, who's seen it all
Secrets from a girl, who's seen it
Secrets from a girl
Secrets from a girl, who's seen it
Secrets from a girl (Secrets from a girl)
Secrets from a girl, who's seen it all

Welcome to Sadness
The temperature is unbearable until you face it
Thank you for flying with Strange Airlines
I will be your tour guide today
Your emotional baggage can be picked up at Carousel Number 2
Please be careful so that it doesn't fall onto someone you love
When we've reached your final destination, I will leave you to it
You'll be fine
I'm just gonna show you in, and um you can stay as long as you need to get familiar with the feeling
And then when you're ready, I'll be outside, and we can go look at the sunrise by euphoria mixed with existential vertigo
Cool

"The Man With The Axe"

If I had to break it down, I'd say it's the way you love to dance
Moving the furniture when my back is turned
The flick of the lights and the world falls away
And your office job, and your silver hair
But our shapes in the dark are the reason I've stayed for all these years

I thought I was a genius
But now I'm twenty-two
And it's starting to feel like all I know how to do is
Put on a suit and take it away
With my fistful of tunes that it's painful to play
Fingernail worlds, like favourite seashells
They fill up my nights and then they float away

I've got hundreds of gowns, I've got paintings in frames
And a throat that fills with panic every festival day
Dutifully falling apart for the Princess of Norway

But you with your doll's lashes, your infinite T-shirts
I should've known when your favourite record was the same as my father's you'd take me down

I guess I'll always be this way
Swallowed up by the words and halfway to space
But there by the fire, you offered your hand
And as I took it, I loved you, the boy with the plan

You felled me clean as a pine
The man with the axe
And the look in his eyes

We've been through so many hard times, I'm writing a love song
For you, baby

"Dominoes"

I heard that you were doing yoga
With Uma Thurman's mother
Just outside of Woodstock
Now you're watering all the flowers
You planted with your new girlfriend
Outside on the rooftop

Just another phase you're rushing on through
Go all New Age, outrunning your blues

Fifty gleaming chances in a row
Then I watch you flick them down like dominoes
Must feel good being Mr. Start-Again

I know
Know a girl who knows a
Another girl who knows the woman that you hurt
It's strange to see you smoking marijuana
You used to do the most cocaine
Of anyone I'd ever met

Just another phase you're shooting on through
The whole world changes right around you
You get fifty gleaming chances in a row
And I watch you flick them down like dominoes
Must feel good being Mr. Start-Again
Yeah, it must feel good being Mr. Start-Again
Don't get up
Yeah, it must feel good being Mr. Start-Again

"Big Star"

Everyone knows that you're too good for me, don't they
I'm a cheater, I lie, and I'm shy
But you like to say hello to total strangers
Shivering pines and walls of colour
I can't believe I used to stay inside

But every perfect summer's gotta say goodnight
Now I watch you run through the amber light
I used to love the party, now I'm not alright
Drinking in the dark, take me home tonight

Baby, you're a big star
You're a big star
Wanna take your picture

I toss up if it's worth it now every time I get on a plane
I've got so much to tell you and not enough time to do it in

But every perfect summer's gotta take its flight
I'll still watch you run through the winter light
I used to love the party, now I'm not alright
Hope the honeybees make it home tonight

Baby, you're a big star
You're a big star
Wanna take your picture

'Til I die
'Til I die
'Til I die

"Leader Of A New Regime"

Wearing SPF 3000 for the ultraviolet rays
Made it to the island on the last of the outbound planes (Ah-ah)
Got a trunk full of Simone and Cline, and of course, my magazines
I'm gonna live out my days

Won't somebody, anybody, be the leader of a new regime
Free the keepers of the burnt-out scene another day
Lust and paranoia reign supreme
We need the leader of a new regime

"Mood Ring"

I'm tryna blow bubbles, but inside
Can't seem to fix my mood
Today it's as dark as my roots
If I, if I ever let them grow out (Ah-ah)
Now all of my oceans have riptides
Can't seem to find what's wrong
The whole world is letting me down
Don't you think the early 2000s seem so far away (Ay-ay-ay-ay)

Ladies, begin your sun salutations
Transcendental in your meditations (Love and light)
You can burn sage, and I'll cleanse the crystals
We can get high, but only if the wind blows (Blows just right)

I can't feel a thing
I keep looking at my mood ring
Tell me how I'm feeling
Floating away, floating away

I'm tryna get well from the inside
Plants and celebrity news, all the vitamins I consume
Let's fly somewhere eastern, they'll have what I need (They'll have what I need)
Let's go

Ladies, begin your sun salutations
Pluto in Scorpio generation (Love and light)
You can burn sage, and I'll cleanse the crystals
We can get high, but only if the wind blows (Blows just right, ri-ri-ri-right)

I can't feel a thing
I keep looking at my mood ring
Tell me how I'm feeling
Floating away, floating away
All the sad girls sing
We'll keep dancing 'til the mood rings
Tell us how we're feeling
Floating away, floating away

Take me to some kinda
Take me to some kinda
Take me to some kinda place (Anywhere)
Watch the sun set, look back on my life (Take me to some kinda)
I just wanna know, will it be alright (Take me to some kinda)
Take me to some kinda place (Anywhere)

"Oceanic Feeling"

It's a blue day
We could jump Bulli
When I hit that water
When it holds me
I think about my father
Doin' the same thing
When he was a boy
When he was a boy
It's a blue day
We could go fishing
You'll catch the big one
Ah

Slidin' the knife under the skin
Grateful for this offering
And all the livin' things under the sun
Under the sun

Little brother, I think you're an angel
I see your silver chain levitate
When you're kick-flipping
Baby boy, you're super cool
I know you're scared, so was I
But all will be revealed in time (Time, time)

Oh, look, the rays are in the bay now
Can you hear the waves and the cicadas all around
I can make anything real
Brain so hot, it's a summer body
Every day is blue and never cloudy
Don't look down
I can make anything real

In the future
If I have a daughter
Will she have my waist
Or my widow's peak
My dreamer's disposition or my wicked streak

Will she split a tab with her lover
And laugh at the stars like her mother
When she was a girl
When she was a girl

Now the cherry-black lipstick's gathering dust in a drawer
I don't need her anymore
'Cause I got this power
I just had to breathe (Breathe out, breathe out, breathe out, breathe out)
And tune in (Tune in, tune in, tune in, tune in)
I just had to breathe (Breathe out, breathe out, breathe out, breathe out)
And tune in (Tune in, tune in, tune in, tune in)
I just had to breathe
And tune in
I just had to breathe
And tune in
I just had to breathe

Oh, was enlightenment found
No, but I'm tryin', takin' it one year at a time
Oh, oh, can you hear the sound
It's shimmerin' higher
On the beach, I'm buildin' a pyre
(Use the wood brought in by the tide)
I know you'll show me how, I'll know when it's time
To take off my robes and step into the choir

"Helen Of Troy"

Hey, hey

You've heard it all before
One minute, I was killing 'em all
And the next, a brown suit wouldn't let me perform, ah
Typical
So I took a happy face
And it's coming on like a charm
I don't wanna get lost, I wanna worship the sun
If you want, you can come

I'm in my own little golden age
But it's such a pill when they don't appreciate

So when you smoke that cigarette
Or when you talk shit 'bout an old friend
I know it's hard, but do your best
Give yourself a break, have a little faith, ah
Let's hear it for the girls
Living in the modern world

They're banging on the door
"Everyone please make way
For the girl who looks like she flew in from outer space
Yesterday, eh"
I think I'll wait it out
My little thing is keeping 'em keen
They could be drinking with you, but they'll be looking at me
This whole time, I've been playing it coy
The city's falling for me just like I'm Helen of Troy, ah

So when you're broke, can't get ahead
Or when you take it out on your boyfriend
I know it's hard, but do your best
Give yourself a break, have a little faith
Let's hear it for the girls
Living in the modern world

Give yourself a break, have a little faith
Let's hear it for the girls
Living in the modern world
Let's hear it for the girls (Let's hear it for the girls)
Living in the modern world (Living in the modern world)

"Hold No Grudge"

Remember when we used to sing, baby, up in your room
Before your mother got home
There was a sound to our innocence
Our voices were lovers in the same bed
Now I'm not sure how they would sound, isn't that sad
Now that the ocean's all waves and the diamonds are blood
There's a new girl on your song
I didn't know that I could be replaced
Years ago, I tried to get a message to you
But I never heard back, I never heard back

Where did we go wrong
Our haven was always in the song
But just when I go to close the gates permanently
I realise that it isn't me

No, I don't keep a list, can't hold a grudge
Don't you think that we both might've done some growing up
Well, I know that some shit was said and done
But it's such a different world now, I can't hate anyone

Remember when we woke at dawn
Saw the silver sun in your old Citron
And remember when we took them on
Stoners on the run, How the West Was Won

Remember when we used to swim, baby, no one around
Take off all our clothes
And in the clear cold, we were born again
I used to count down to your birthday
Now I'm not sure if it's June or July, isn't that sad

Where did we go wrong
Our haven was always in the song
But just when I go to close the gates permanently
I realise that it isn't me

No, I don't keep a list, can't hold a grudge (Hold no grudge)
Don't you think that we both might've done some growing up
Yeah, I know that some shit was said and done (Said and done)
But it's such a different world now, I can't hate anyone

Remember when we woke at dawn
Saw the silver sun in your old Citron
And remember when we took them on
Stoners on the run, How the West Was Won

Acting my age, not my horoscope
Guess that's growing up
Now I'm sending you love and wishing you well
Wherever you are

Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone

Being alone

You switch the screens over the
Rest of your flows
Easy, easy

Get what they want

Throw out the lunch you paid for
Thought it would suck, but now it's
Easy, oh, easy
Throw out the lunch you paid for
Oh, easy, easy

Pull out the heart that keeps you
Feeling alone
Easy, easy
Pull out your heart to make the
Being alone

"Everybody Wants To Rule The World"
(from "The Hunger Games Catching Fire" soundtrack)

Welcome to your life
There's no turning back
Even while we sleep
We will find you

Acting on your best behavior
Turn your back on Mother Nature
Everybody wants to rule the world

It's my own desire
It's my own remorse
Help me to decide
Help me make the most of freedom
And of pleasure
Nothing ever lasts forever
Everybody wants to rule the world

There's a room where the light won't find you
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down
When they do, I'll be right behind you
So glad we've almost made it
So sad we had to fade it
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world
Everybody wants to rule the world

"Flicker (Kanye West Rework)"
(from "The Hunger Games Mockingjay, Part 1" soundtrack)

I'm a princess cut from marble, smoother than a storm
And the scars that mark my body, they're silver and gold
My blood is a flood of rubies, precious stones
It keeps my veins hot, the fires find a home in me
I move through town, I'm quiet like a fight
And my necklace is of rope, I tie it and untie it

And now people talk to me, but nothing ever hits home
People talk to me, and all the voices just burn holes
I'm done with it (ooh)

This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We're at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

I dream all year, but they're not the sweet kinds
And the shivers move down my shoulder blades in double time

And now people talk to me I'm slipping out of reach now
People talk to me, and all their faces blur
But I got my fingers laced together and I made a little prison
And I'm locking up everyone who ever laid a finger on me
I'm done with it (ooh)

This is the start of how it all ends
They used to shout my name, now they whisper it
I'm speeding up and this is the
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart
We're at the start, the colors disappear
I never watch the stars, there's so much down here
So I just try to keep up with them
Red, orange, yellow flicker beat sparking up my heart

And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat
Sparking up my heart
And this is the red, orange, yellow flicker beat-beat-beat-beat

"Good Fights"

Face the world, tell your friends
You don't really love them
But you really love when
Braid your hair and give in
We could try to get in to the place where it ends
Where everything ends, it spins again

Oh, I didn't come all this way just to blow the night
Oh, you can feel sorry for people that are in your mind
Oh, and if it feels close, even when you don't feel alright
(It's alright, it's alright)
Everyone stay up like a good fight

There's a place in your head for what doesn't make sense
For the things you don't get
Look them up when you get in
We could try to get in, get rejected again
Laugh it off again, I guess oh well

Oh, I didn't come all this way just to blow the night
Oh, you can feel sorry for people are in your mind
Oh, and if it feels close, even when you don't feel alright
(It's alright, it's alright)
Everyone stay up like a good fight

Incurred on to bright green eyes
You used to love to spend up time
Driving like a coil in the little lights out
Money, we solve our safe
She'll toss her head and play again
Examine every face and realize
Oh, it's good to feel again

Oh, I didn't come all this way just to blow the night
Oh, you can feel sorry for people are in your mind
Oh, and if it feels close, even when you don't feel alright
(It's alright, it's alright)
Everyone stay up like a good fight

"Homemade Dynamite (Remix)"
(feat. SA, Post Malone & Khalid)

[Lorde]
A couple rebel Top Gun pilots
Flyin' with nowhere to be, ooh-ooh
Don't know you super well
But I think that you might be the same as me
Behave abnormally

Let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
Yeah, awesome, right
So let's let things come out of the woodwork
I'll give you my best side, tell you all my best lies
See me rollin', showin' someone else love
Dancin' with our shoes off
Know I think you're awesome, right

[Lorde (SA)]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
(Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite)

[Khalid]
I wanna feel the light
Pushing our limits, unbuckled for the ride, mm
We're way too far from home
Let's be honest with ourselves
We're way too high to drive
So let's take on the night (Mmm)
If the light is in the air, open, finally
We're going and we're free

[Khalid & Lorde]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

[SA]
I checked your girl at the door
I sent your friend to the store
It's only me and you, finally us two
And I don't regret drinkin' this liquor
Makin' you listen
Yeah, I know you don't know me well
My girl's at the door and I left my pretense at home
And it ain't no goin' back (Goin' back)

[SA & Lorde]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite

[Post Malone]
Walk, never fall, but we still run
So pour up, pour up another one
I know, I know we on to somethin'
We got, we got a loaded gun, yeah
Go and shoot me that look in your eyes
And you're here, I'm yours, you're mine
Find each other when we're losin' our minds
Then we take it all off
You're a runaway train, yeah
And you got me so faded
And I don't wanna chase it, no
You know I think you're awesome, right

[All (Post Malone)]
Our rules, our dreams, we're blind
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
Our friends, our drinks, we get inspired
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite (Yeah, yeah)
Blowin' shit up with homemade d-d-d-dynamite
(Blowin' shit up)

Now you know it's really gonna blow

"Ladder Song"
(from "The Hunger Games Mockingjay - Part 1" soundtrack)

No one knows where the ladder goes
You're gonna lose what you love the most
You're not alone in anything
You're not unique in dying

I feel estranged every now and then
Fall asleep reading science fiction
I wanna fly in your silver ship
Let my mama hang and my sister sit

It's on now
The days are long now
The ups and the sundowns
And a twisting mind

If I gotta go first
I'll do it on my terms
I'm tired of traitors
Always changing sides
They were friends of mine

Don't hang around once the promise breaks
Or you'll be there when the next one's made
Kiss the feet of a charlatan
Some imagine freedom

All the rest is predictable
Trying your hardest to melt the snow
Tie the knots to concentrate
Keep on pulling, that rope will break

We'll welcome the new age
Covered in warrior paint
Lights from the jungle to the sky

See now, a star bursts
Looks just like a blood orange
Don't it just make you wanna cry
Precious friend of mine

Will I know when it's finally done
This whole life's a hallucination
You're not alone in anything
You're not alone in trying to be

"No Better"

We roll in heavy summer when there's strength in our numbers
And your breath's hot and gross but I kiss you like a lover
Legs stick to the seats of the car someone grew into
I forget the knowledge from the lessons that I went to

And Jamie picks fights but they're weak and short-lived
Because no one can be bothered when it's humid like this
And we roll in heavy summer like it's shameful to be underneath a ceiling or a roof try come out and steal our thunder

Now the days are getting cooler
And the burning of our limbs doesn't happen quite as bad and the burn is just
Skin-deep in the fantasies and dreams of the winter like the movies
That we watched to pretend it wasn't winter
And everywhere we go I can feel a subtle taste of the deeds outgrown and the welcome overstayed
And you're no better at swimming than you were in the beginning but you come over at night and we practice all the breathing

Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down

I'll pull the trick if I want to
I'll pull the trick and it comes true
I'm chewing gum and it's killing you
We're getting dead and it's the right way to do it
I see you happy in the front seat
I see you with all of your front teeth
You're allergic but you never said
We're getting dead and it's the right way

Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down
Go all the way
Have your fun, have it all
This will take you down
Get through the days
Do your thing, do it well
This will take you down

"Precious Metals"
(live version)

The Chanel, the Dior and the Prada
Take it home, make a fire in the garden
Sundance kids, so godless
One day it's gonna be not like this
Black sand on all our beaches
Witchcraft, split lip and a bee sting
But what I really wanna know is

Do I look like a fool
'Cause I must be a fool
To hold on to precious metals like I do, I do, I do
To hold on to precious metals like I do, I do, I do

The Chanel, the Dior, and the Prada
Give my best to the ones that are bothered
Take a flight trip to Jakarta
All the kids at the shows make it louder
All of the feelings and all of the tears are going
All of the secrets and all of the schemes that don't go my way
I wish you would come back, didn't want to run back
Come back, bet you want to come back
And I'll find you

Do I look like a fool
'Cause I must be a fool
To hold on to precious metals like I do (ah), do (ah), do (ah)
To hold on to precious metals like I do (ah), do (ah), do (ah)

Ah, ah, ah...

"Supercut (El-P Remix)"
(feat. Run The Jewels)

[Lorde]
In my
Supercut of us
Supercut
Supercut of, supercut of, supercut of us

In my head
I play a supercut of us
All the magic we gave off
All the love we had and lost
And in my head
The visions never stop
These ribbons wrap me up
But when I reach for you
There's just a supercut

Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us

In your car, the radio up
In your car, the radio up
In your car, the supercut of us
We keep tryna talk about us
Slow motion, I'm watchin' our love
In your car, the supercut of, supercut of

[Killer Mike]
We is the villains, and there ain't no chillin'
Get body bags and the toe tags, yeah
Scoundrels in housin', we tore through your town
And we reload it and now we back, man
Forgiato rollin' on a '96 Impala
With a pretty thing, show me where I'm slayin'
I ain't playin' with you lames, 700 horse in the Hellcat
Take ya bitch, where ya at

[El-P]
Dirty, all-black Jeep, 2018
With the clean rhyme rappers on deck, check
Came with the bad bars, bully with the big box
Shush when the runners on set
G-G-Give it up, you don't got a bit of luck left
Nah, not even a itty bit of fresh (Good lord)
Fall on your sword for the crime abhorrent
That's your reward for the mindless whorin'

[Killer Mike]
This for everybody that hated
Michael and Jamie, we made it
Every debt due, we paid it
My cadence is heinous
You keep tryna play us, and you gon' be famous
And just like the top on my 7-5 drop
I'm just hittin' a button and you gon' be brainless
And that's from the back of a 'lac where I'm smokin' the sack
With my girl, watchin' seasons of Shameless

[El-P]
There's no manual, Run The Jewels publish shit annual
Every minute I'm in it, I'm runnin' a clinic
Wild animal, livin' like a Fine Young Cannibal
Citizen of cynics, admit it, the kid get it
Earth's a hot block, the pot get chop-chopped
You walk and watch blocks my heart should pop off
The hot rocks shooters will knock your whole op off
That's why I don't got tocks on the clock to rock soft

[Lorde]
So I fall
Into continents and cars
All the stages and the stars
I turn all of it
To just a su

Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of us
Supercut, supercut of, supercut of, super, super

"Swingin' Party"

Bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending, can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail

If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line

Pound the prairie pavement, losing proposition
Quitting school and going to work and never going fishing
Water all around, I never learned how to swim now

If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong's your kind, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line

Bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party
Here it's never ending, can't remember when it started
Pass around the lampshade, there'll be plenty enough room in jail

If being wrong's a crime, I'm serving forever
If being strong is what you want, then I need help here with this feather
If being afraid is a crime, we hang side by side
At the swingin' party down the line
At the swingin' party down the line

Well baby I learned one thing from you
You can try to be my hell, to be my beating
But every time I love myself, it hurts your feelings

So if I feel real good tonight
I'm gonna put it high on the loudspeaker
And if I feel like crying, I won't hide it
I am a loudspeaker
I am a loudspeaker
I am a loudspeaker

What you've done to me
Well I've seen many a friend be silenced
Thinking nobody would believe them
Well baby you've got another thing coming
You can try to make me stop, call it delusion
But every time I don't shut up, it's revolution

So if I feel real good tonight
I'm gonna put it high on the loudspeaker
And if I feel like crying, I won't hide it
I am a loudspeaker
I am a loudspeaker
I am a loudspeaker

I don't know where the blame lies
But you better believe I'm not gonna carry it all
I don't know where the shame dies
But it's helping me to scream this is not my fault
I don't know where the blame lies
But you better believe I'm not gonna carry it all
I don't know where the shame dies
But it's helping me to scream this is not my fault
I don't know where the blame lies
But you better believe I'm not gonna carry it all
I don't know where the shame dies
But it's helping me to scream this is not my fault
But it's helping me to scream
Not, not my fault

So if I feel real good tonight
I'm gonna put it high on the loudspeaker
If I feel like crying, I won't hide it
I am a loudspeaker

"So Special"

There's a few bad things I've done
That nobody made me do
Most just to get myself off
And the rest to get over you
Meant the things you said
Turns out I had no idea
You'd ever tell me we were done
Or what that would feel like to hear

Now I know I'm not so special
Cause I'm all dressed up
And you think that I'm beautiful
But it's not enough
Now I know I'm not so special
Cause I'm all dressed up
And you think that I'm beautiful
But it's not enough

Guess I'm gonna find another ride
Guess I'll see you in another life
Guess I'm gonna tell one more lie
I'm surprised you don't wanna stay by my side

I think about the time
And I went down on you in the gallery
And I was always out of line
But I thought you were right there with me

Now I know I'm not so special
Cause you're all dressed up
And I think you're so beautiful
But I'm not your love

Guess I'll never find another ride
Guess I'll see you in another life
Guess I'm gonna tell one more lie
I'm surprised you don't wanna stay by my side

Guess I'm gonna find another ride
Guess I'll see you in another life
Guess I'm gonna tell one more lie
I'm surprised you don't wanna stay by my side

"Winterbreak"

You say I'd best be going cause it's getting late
And I say
Why don't I walk you home cause it's on the way
But the last time
That we made love, you left in tears
So this time
You're wondering how to leave it here
And I haven't seen you since last winter break
And I know that I broke your heart
But always such a smart one, always so intelligent
You must know that I took it hard

Oh, baby I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try
Oh, baby, I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try

You pull
That face like, 'here we go again'
So I pull
A flask out the back of my jeans
And then you take a pull
And in my mind we're in my bed
And I'm pulling
Your sweater up over your head
And I haven't seen you since last winter break
And I know that you hate how that went
But always such a smart one, always so intelligent
You must know what's happening

Oh, baby I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try
Oh, baby, I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try

Oh it's magnetic, isn't it
The sense of something underneath the surface
When you're laying on thin ice
Just a little bit masochistic
A tentative ellipses
The parting of your lips and the ache in your eyes
But I think I'm gonna kiss you

All despite
What we both know

This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try
Oh, baby, I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try

"Promise"

I told a lot of lies
And called it a compromise
To keep you in your seat
I was so afraid to lose
But the things that I did to you
You would never do to me

Why do I
Why do I do it
Why do I do it
You wanna
Hold my hand I make a fist
A false promise
And even if you said you would forgive me
I don't know if I could ever say I'm sorry

I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can
I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can

So I look at you now
Bruised and broken down
By what you thought was love
You tell me you want to stay
And you wanna watch me change
But I'm scared so I tell you to fuck off

Why do I
Why do I do it
Why do I do it
You wanna
Hold my hand I make a fist
A false promise
And even if you said you would forgive me
I don't know if I could ever say I'm sorry

I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can
I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can

Mean hearted girls will kill their loves to hurt themselves
They can't believe that they deserve anything else
And even if you said you know that I'm sorry
I don't know if I could ever forgive me

I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can
I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can

I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can
I don't know if I-

I don't know if I can

I told a lot of lies

"Loudspeaker"

What you want from me
Is all of my time wasted on you
Trying to teach me a lesson
Well baby I learned one thing from you
You can try to be my hell, to be my beating
But every time I love myself, it hurts your feelings

So if I feel real good tonight
I'm gonna put it high on the loudspeaker

"I Know A Place"

I knew
When you told me you don't wanna go home tonight
And you tried to just shrug it off when I asked you why
Somebody hurt you
Somebody hurt you
But you're here by my side
And I knew
'Cause I can recall when I was the one in your seat
I still got the scars and they occasionally bleed
Cause somebody hurt me
Somebody hurt me
But I'm staying alive

And I can tell
When you get nervous
You think being yourself
Means being unworthy
And it's hard to love
With a heart that's hurting
But if you want to go out dancing

I know a place (ooh)
I know a place we can go (yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Just give me trust and watch what'll happen
'Cause I know (ooh)
I know a place we can run (yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Don't you be afraid of love and affection
Just lay down your weapon

Right now
It's like you're carrying all the weight of your past
I see all your bruises, yellow, dark blue, and black
But baby a bruise is, only your body
Tryna keep you intact
So right now
I think we should go get drunk on cheap wine
I think we should hop on the purple line
'Cause maybe our purpose
Is to never give up when we're on the right track

And I can tell
When you get nervous
You think being yourself
Means being unworthy
And it's hard to love
With a heart that's hurting
But if you want to go out dancing

I know a place (ooh)
I know a place we can go (yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Just give me trust and watch what'll happen
'Cause I know (ooh)
I know a place we can run (yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Don't you be afraid of love and affection
Just lay down your weapon
(Lay down your weapon)

They will try to make you unhappy
Don't let them
They will try to tell you you're not free
Don't listen
I, I know a place where you don't need protection
Even if it's only in my imagination
I, I know a place we can go
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Just give me trust and anything can happen

'Cause I know (ooh)
I know a place we can go (yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Just give me trust and watch what'll happen
'Cause I know (ooh)
I know a place we can stay (yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Don't you be afraid of love and affection
Just lay down your weapon

"Around U"

I would swear I'd never plan again
But I can see the irony
I'm humbled by the passing of time
I am brought down onto my knees
An Arizona half and half
A half a pack of cigarettes
A vacant lot, my tangled thoughts
Suburbia give me my God again

All senses say, nothing has changed
The soft lines from the streetlights fall the same on my face

But something massive happened here
I can feel it in the atmosphere
Something false that once was true
I no longer revolve around you
I no longer revolve around you

And the house still stands where it was built
I know 'cause I drove by tonight
A candle in the bedroom
Where I once performed a holy rite
And I did stop to hang my head
Just for a moment at the light
'Cause now the altar is a bed
And now you're just a friend that once was mine

Oh civilian, idling along
How can you understand that there's a whole world gone wrong

But something massive happened here
Can you feel it in the atmosphere
Something false that once was true
I no longer revolve around you
I no longer revolve around you

How can I try to be civilized
When inside there is a shift in paradigm
And everything we built, we built on our love
Everything spinning on one assumption
How can I try to say sorry
When my words don't carry the same gravity
And everything I say, I say it knowing
Full well you still don't want to believe

Something massive happened here
But you can feel it in the atmosphere
Something false that once was true
I no longer revolve around you

Something massive happened here
But you can feel it in the atmosphere
Something false that once was true
I no longer revolve around you
I no longer revolve around you

"After"

It comes on slow but
It leaves much faster
We need something to hold us
During and after

Is it all alright
Is it all alright
Is it all alright now
Is it all alright

After the beauty
After the sunrise
After the come down
After the big fight
I am asking

Is it all alright (Even if it is not)
Is it all alright (Even if it is not)
Is it all alright now (Even if it is not)
Is it all alright (Even if it is not)

It feels like a dream, what happened last night
In the morning I am waiting in a long, long line
I felt so connected, I felt so high
I am going to be lonely for a long, long time

And it's all alright (Even if it is not)
And it's all alright (Even if it is not)
And it's all alright now (Even if it is not)
And it's all alright (Even if it is not)

"Promise"

I told a lot of lies
And called it a compromise
To keep you in your seat
I was so afraid to lose
But the things that I did to you
You would never do to me

Why do I
Why do I do it
Why do I do it
You wanna
Hold my hand I make a fist
A false promise
And even if you said you would forgive me
I don't know if I could ever say I'm sorry

I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can
I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can

So I look at you now
Bruised and broken down
By what you thought was love
You tell me you want to stay
And you wanna watch me change
But I'm scared so I tell you to fuck off

Why do I
Why do I do it
Why do I do it
You wanna
Hold my hand I make a fist
A false promise
And even if you said you would forgive me
I don't know if I could ever say I'm sorry

I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can
I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can

Mean hearted girls will kill their loves to hurt themselves
They can't believe that they deserve anything else
And even if you said you know that I'm sorry
I don't know if I could ever forgive me

I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can
I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can

I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can
I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can

I told a lot of lies
And called it a compromise
To keep you
(You said you would)

"If U Love Me Now"

I could read your mind
I know what you're thinking
This is not what you signed up for
I could pray to God
But I'm not invested
And you get what you pay for

I've been trying to find out if anyone
Feels truly happy because of all that they have done
'Cause I always seem to want more
Provided that I can get some

There's me in the corner throwing a fit
Making a mess of it
Don't you love me now
There's me under the table, hiding from my
Lovers and my allies
Don't you love me now
It's just a hypothesis or test, that I should not exist
Don't you love me now
There's me in the doorway telling you please
You should just let me leave
If you love me now

I could bite my tongue
Trying not to say that my love
For you looks different
I could bide my time
Hoping I can fix it
But it goes against my instincts

And I've been trying to find out if anyone
Feels super sure that they are deserving of someone
'Cause I always seem to give it up
Provided that I can get some

There's me in the corner throwing a fit
Making a mess of it
Don't you love me now
There's me under the table hiding from my
Lovers and my allies
Don't you love me now
It's just a hypothesis or test, that I should not exist
Don't you love me now
There's me in the doorway telling you please
You should just let me leave
If you love me now

It's just a hypothesis or test, that I should not exist
Don't you love me now
There's me in the doorway telling you please
You should just let me leave
If you love me now

"Crying On The Bathroom Floor"

Give me that diamond ring
Give me that love on the movie screen
And I won't feel a thing
Promise I won't feel a thing
Give me that kiss goodnight
Give me that gold, tell me it's alright
And I won't feel a thing
Promise I won't feel a thing

And I guess that I got rewired
'Cause you're cold as ice but it feels like fire, fire, fire, fire
And the drugs don't work and I don't know why
But when you hurt me I go higher, higher, higher, higher

But when I'm crying on the bathroom floor
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could never ask for more
If I'm never gonna ask for more from a lover
Crying on the bathroom floor
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could never ask for more
If I'm never gonna ask for more from a lover

Give me your disrespect
Give me your pain and loneliness
And I'll love you the best
Promise I'll love you the best
Give me no peace of mind
Give me distress, give me all your lies
And I'll love you for life
Promise I'll love you 'til I die

But I'm crying on the bathroom floor
(Give me some more)
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could ever ask for more
(Would you give me some more)
If I'm never gonna ask for more from a lover
Crying on the bathroom floor
(Give me some more)
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could never ask for more
(Would you give me some more)
If I'm never gonna ask for more from a lover

It's asking a lot of myself
I'm asking a lot of myself
It's taking a lot out of me, loving you
It's taking a lot out of me, loving you
Asking a lot of myself
I'm asking a lot of myself
It's taking a lot out of me, loving you
There isn't a lot that I think I can do

I'm crying on the bathroom floor
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could ever ask for more
(Would you give me some more)
If I'm never gonna ask for more from a lover
Crying on the bathroom floor
(Give me some more)
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could never ask for more
(Would you give me some more)
If I'm never gonna ask for more from a lover

"End Of Desire"

Oh God, save me
I want an impossible thing
I want to be free of this ache, of this need
I want not to want anything
Someone said, "God is here tonight"
Said they saw her outside getting high
Turn your head to the side
Hold your gaze against mine
And there it is
A mark of the divine

Are you taking me to the end of desire (end of desire)
Are you taking me home (taking me home)
Are you taking me home (taking me home)
Are you taking me to the end of desire (end of desire)
Are you taking me home (taking me home)
Are you taking me home (taking me home)

I am consumed
All my nights I think only of you
Taking all I have left
In exchange for a death
That is painless
That will make me new

Are you taking me to the end of desire (end of desire)
Are you taking me home (taking me home)
Are you taking me home (taking me home)
Are you taking me to the end of desire (end of desire)
Are you taking me home (taking me home)
Are you taking me home (taking me home)

Deep down I know
I am worshiping a false idol
Deep down I know
It's a false hope
But I won't let go of this feeling
Like I've got something to believe in
Like your love can maybe make me whole

My love, are you taking me home

Are you taking me to the end of desire (end of desire)
Are you taking me home (taking me home)
Are you taking me home (taking me home)
Are you taking me to the end of desire (end of desire)
Are you taking me home (taking me home)
Are you taking me home (taking me home)

My love, are you taking me home

"Everything"

I saw a beautiful girl on the street
She looked nothing like me, I think
But I wanted to call you
And tell you about
The way that her hair got caught in her mouth

I saw the wing of a bird on the road
It was early, I was walking alone
And I found it lovely
And I found it sad
I don't know how you'd find it but I wanted to ask

Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you

And at the bar, on TV
They were talking about the casualties
Four hundred and counting
And my only question
Was, how would you feel if one was me

Would you wish we'd made love again
Would you want to revisit the marks on my skin
'Cause the world could be burning
And all I'd be thinking is
"How are you doing, baby"

Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you

I'm sorry to be so serious
I know you don't like my long face
I am only here to tell you
That I am eviscerated
I'm sorry to be so serious
I know you can't stand me this way
But I took hope in half-desire
You are wildfire and I'm standing in the rain

After everything, everything, everything, everything, everything, everything

Everything's about you to me (it's about you to me)
Everything's about you to me (about you to me)
Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you

Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you

"Outro"

(Why do I do it, why do I)

What happened then, happened then
There's no use in recap
You said that you gave your best
And you think maybe it's time
But how long do you plan
To keep me in the back of your mind
For someday, maybe next time, oh

I start to cry
You're reaching out
I let you in, you're leaving now
I scream, "This is not the end"
Cause I could
And you hurt me 'cause you should
Yeah, you should
I said "try," I thought we could
I thought we could
You said you would

"Grow"

I want to grow up
I want to put away my childish things
I think that I'm ready to
Take this song off repeat
I want to grow up
I'm tried of the party games
I'm calling their bluff
They always turn out the same

And I want to grow up
I want to grow old
I want to lay down
I want to let go

I want to grow
I want to grow

"Number One Fan"

So I heard the bad news
Nobody likes me and I'm gonna die alone
In my bedroom
Looking at strangers on my telephone
Well, wouldn't you
Wouldn't you like if I believed those words
If I'm born to lose
I'll never try and I will never learn, but

I've been looking at myself in the mirror, saying
"Don't leave me now, don't leave me now"
I've been looking at myself in the mirror, saying
"Don't leave me now," and I turn around like

"Oh my God, like, I'm your number one fan
So iconic, like big, like stan, like
I would give my life just to hold your hand
I'm your number one fan
I'm your number one, number one fan"

So here's the bad news
I'm coming for everyone and I'm coming on strong
New hair and new shoes
Yeah, I get what I like because I do what I want

I've been looking at myself in the mirror, saying
"Don't leave me now, don't leave me now"
I've been looking at myself in the mirror, saying
"Don't leave me now," and I turn around like

"Oh my God, like, I'm your number one fan
So iconic, like big, like stan, like
I would give my life just to hold your hand
I'm your number one fan
I'm your number one, number one fan"

Number one, number one
Number one, number one

In the thick of it
Will you stick up for me
In the thick of it
Are you gonna believe that I can do it
Love me in the way that only you can
Be my number one, number one

"Oh my God, like, I'm your number one fan
So iconic, like big, like stan, like
I would give my life just to hold your hand
I'm your number one fan
I'm your number one, number one fan
Oh my God, like, I'm your number one fan
So iconic, like big, like stan, like
I would give my life just to hold your hand
I'm your number one fan
I'm your number one, number one fan"

Number one, number one
Number one, number one

"Stayaway"

If I see my old friends, we'll go out dancing
If we go out dancing, then we'll go to the bar
If we go to the bar, then there's gonna be drinking
If I drink, I wanna see where you are
So I don't see my old friends, I don't go dancing
I don't do most things I used to do
Actually, now that I'm thinking about it
I did most things to get to you

No one ever told me leaving was the easy part
I gotta stay away
Leaving you was easy, now I gotta do what's hard
I gotta stay away

Stay away, stay, stay away
Stay away, stay, stay away

If I go driving, then I'll put on music
If I put on music, then I'll play your song
If I play your song, then I think I'll lose it
End up pulled up at the front of your lawn
So I don't go driving, no, I just stay in
I don't do most things I used to do
'Cause every moment is a fork in the road
And all my roads lead back to you (You, you, you)

No one ever told me leaving was the easy part
I gotta stay away
Leaving you was easy, now I gotta do what's hard
I gotta stay away

Stay away, stay, stay away
Stay away, stay, stay away

If I turn off the light, then I might start thinking
If I start thinking, I'll think of the time when
You said that you love me, you said I was perfect
You said you were sorry, you said you were selfish
If I don't stop it, before I know it
All the bad things never happened
You never lied or treated me bad and
If you did, then you'll wish you hadn't
Start believing you were right and
I was being too dramatic
So I gotta leave the light on for tonight
Just so I can stay away

No one ever told me leaving was the easy part
I gotta stay away
Leaving you was easy, now I gotta do what's hard
I gotta stay away
Any little misstep, I'll be at your doorstep
Talking 'bout forgiveness, giving you my heart back
Just so you can break it one more time before I say
I gotta stay away

Stay away, stay, stay away
Stay away, stay, stay away
Stay away, stay away
Stay away, stay, stay away

"Who"

I never thought you knew what love was
Until I heard you sing a love song
With the way that you treat me
I had to reach my own conclusions

Oh I, I thought your heart was stone
I thought you never let your feelings show

So who, who, who are you singing about now
Now

You sounded clear as a crystal
You sounded soft as the rainfall
And every note was a lump in my throat
But I knew I had to hear it all

I need to know who
Who, who are you singing about
Who, who, who are you singing about now
Now

And it was like a dream to hear such a sweet melody
But I knew it was not for me

I need to know who
Who, who are you singing about
Who, who, who are you singing about now
Who, who, who are you singing about now
Who, who are you singing about now
Who, who are you singing about

"Navy Blue"

Drove to mountains in the morning
On the way back down, I thought my brakes were broken
And the road would end but I would just keep going
Through the air and into the Pacific Ocean

I'm just trying to keep my head above
Water
Get enough sleep and drink enough
Water

I'm so navy blue
I'm so navy blue
I'm so navy blue over you

Took a train to a friend's house feeling shaken
Seems like you somehow turn up when I'm at my weakest
Don't know what to say so leave it blank like silence
Go back home and wait for some new change that's coming

I'm just trying to keep my head above
Water
Get enough sleep and drink enough
Water

I'm so navy blue
I'm so navy blue
I'm so navy blue over you
I'm so navy blue
I'm so navy blue
I'm so navy blue over you

Do you know that I've been holding my breath all of this time
Weren't you gonna call me when you got back
Was it all lies
Do you know that I've been holding my breath all of this time
Weren't you gonna love me if I just did everything right
Do you know that I've been holding my breath all of this time
Weren't you gonna call me when you got back
Was it all lies
Do you know that I've been holding my breath all of this time
Weren't you gonna love me if I just did everything right

I'm so blue
I'm so

"Never"

I don't know if I like love
I think I've had enough
Seems like it's alright for some
It's just I am not one
Consider this my resignation
Please consider this an end
And deliver this recitation
To the one who did me in

I'll never love again
I'll never love again
I'll never love again
I'll never love again

I don't know if I like songs
I think maybe I was wrong
To think I could make it hurt less
With a chorus sing-along
Consider this, cause this is it
As a kind of requiem
And deliver this last performance
To the source from which it stems

I'll never sing again
I'll never sing again
I'll never sing again
I'll never sing again

"Pink Light"

(Are you happy)

So I let it happen again
I loved someone who's indifferent
That's why I can't sleep at night
That's why I keep sleeping in

So I started over again
I got back onto that medicine
That's why I keep sleeping in
I don't like when dreaming ends

But there's a pink light in my apartment
It comes mid-morning as a reminder
That at the right time, in the right surroundings
I will be lovely, but I can't help thinking

That maybe if you stayed for an hour or two
When the sun came up, when I last saw you
Maybe if you'd seen the soft pink light
I wouldn't be alone tonight

So I'm living inside my mind
I keep retracing that storyline
Thinking, if I start again
I can change the way it ends

And there's a pink light in my apartment
It comes mid-morning as a reminder
That at the right time, in the right surroundings
I will be lovely, but I can't help thinking

That maybe if you stayed for an hour or two
When the sun came up, when I last saw you
Maybe if you'd seen the soft pink light
I wouldn't be alone tonight
Tonight, tonight
Alone tonight

Maybe I will always keep
A little piece of this belief
If it isn't you who sees
Then there isn't any pink light in my apartment
It comes mid-morning as a reminder

And maybe if you stayed for an hour or two
When the sun came up, when I last saw you
Maybe if you'd seen the soft pink light
I wouldn't be alone tonight
Tonight, tonight
Alone tonight
Tonight, tonight

"Taken"

Pulled up, quarter to 11
Waited a minute 'til you went in
We talked and then we stopped talking
Put on a song and we listened
I know that I make you nervous
I do it half on purpose
You know I think you're precious
Yeah, I think you're a good person

So why do I wanna blow up your life

I'll be a very good girl
I won't even think about it
I'm just feeling like I can't help it
I know you said you had a girlfriend
I just want it if it's taken
If it's taken

Dad left when I was 11
Mom said it was 'cause he couldn't
Keep from touching other women
Some things have a way of sticking
And now I'm standing in your kitchen
You said you told her you were leaving
And I can't help thinking
I hate you 'cause you're just like him

So why did I have to blow up your life

I'll be a very good girl
I won't even think about it
I'm just feeling like I can't help it
I know you said you had a girlfriend
I just want it

I just thought that if I could take you from her
Maybe then it would prove that I'm worth something
Now I'm alone and I'm hurt
Wishing I'd taken you at your word
When you said that you were taken

I'll be a very good girl
I won't even think about it
I'm just feeling like I can't help it
I know you said you had a girlfriend
I just want it if it's taken

I know you said
I just want it

"Hands Off"

I see you, I see you
And it's been some time since I've seen you last
You know the night, I bet you know the night
I'm here, you're here
And it's in the air like a firefly
June and July, like it's June and July

I, I, I know you're bad for me
But when you say you want me again
Want me again and again
I can feel you up on me
It hits me all of the sudden
(Wait, why would I do that)

No, you can't touch, get your hands off of me
(Can't touch, hands off)
There's no reason, just a feeling, I'm free
(Can't touch, your hands off)
No, you can't touch, get your hands off of me
(Can't touch, hands off)
There's no reason, just a feeling, I'm free
(Can't touch, hands off)

I see you, I see you
And, oh God, I get so high every time
Happens every time
A damn idea
I focus then I hold that feeling inside
Got this feeling inside

I, I, I want you, come closer
I feel like I've been here before
Been here before, before
You, you, you want the power
You tell me it's now or never
(What the heck)

No, you can't touch, get your hands off of me
(Can't touch, hands off)
There's no reason, just a feeling, I'm free
(Can't touch, hands off)
No, you can't touch, get your hands off of me
(Can't touch, hands off)
There's no reason, just a feeling, I'm free
(Can't touch, hands off) I'm free

You think I'm playing hard to get
This must be hard to get
You've got to get your hands off, yeah
You think I'm playing with your head
This must be hard to get
(Do you need me to do the chorus again, or...)

Can't touch, get your hands off of me
There's no reason, just a feeling, I'm free
No, you can't touch, get your hands off of me
There's no reason, just a feeling, I'm free
I'm free

Can't touch, hands off
No, you can't touch, get your, get your hands off

"Good News (Ya-Ya Song)"

I must be some great feeler
I must be really deep
I had a minor major crisis
When you stopped calling me

I saw a psychic healer
She just turned seventeen
All that she said was to do what I want
Like I'm supposed to know what that means

I'm gonna figure it out
'Cause I'm already here, and I won't leave now
So put a pot of coffee on
I'm just having a time
But the good news is, if you don't like life
They say it doesn't last so long

Ooh, ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya

I was sad in the kitchen
Tearing myself apart
Trying to search for the piece that I'm missing
But I didn't know where to start

So I went to an art exhibit
There wasn't any art
All that there was was a sink and some dishes
And a sign saying, "Be where you are"

I'm gonna figure it out
'Cause I'm already here, and I won't leave now
So put a pot of coffee on
I'm just having a time
But the good news is, if you don't like life
They say it doesn't last so long

Ooh, ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya

I know it's not just me
Who thinks it is just me
I know it's not just me
Who thinks it is

Ooh, ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya

"Memento"

Got a bee sting on the way back from your house
It was crawling up my leg inside my car
Something 'bout the way I had to pull it out
Never healed quite right, and now I've got a scar

I'm glad it left a mark
I'm glad it left a mark

To remind me what it seems like I forget
When I'm drinking or I'm thinking with my heart
Softly saying, "Baby, this is what you get
When you're reckless, and you're playing in the dark"

I'm glad it left a mark
I'm glad it left a mark
I'm glad it left a mark

"It's Gonna Be Okay, Baby"

You're gonna move to New York
And experiment with communism
Go down on a girl
After reading her some Frantz Fanon
And you'll go out of your way
Trying to find some place you can hide and get high
You're gonna think about suicide
Yeah, you're gonna call your mom

It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay

You're gonna cut off your hair
With dull scissors from the desk in your dorm room
Learn by trial and error
That threesomes are more sad than fun
You're gonna move to LA
Guess you're running away from the patterns you have
And the decisions that you've made
Yeah, you're gonna sit in the sun

It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay

You're gonna smoke cigarettes
On the ground beside the pool at Stardust
You're gonna get obsessed
With a boy who's hooked on heroin
You'll have some all-time nights
Dancing outside with LCD on the speaker
And you're drinking dark pink wine
Yeah, and you're gonna lose those friends

It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay

You're gonna fall in love
With a girl, which you were not expecting
You're gonna start a band
It's just her, another friend, and you
And then you get freaked out
You say something about how you just can't commit
And you move into your aunt's house
Yeah, and all your dreams come true

It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay

You're gonna come to depend
On the sex of a sadistic stranger
You're gonna learn to pretend
Yeah, you lie about it to save face
Until the morning you awake
In the deepest of pain that you've even been in
And you admit you've gotta quit him
Yeah, you're gonna learn to pray

It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay (It's gonna be okay)
It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay (It's gonna be okay)

You're gonna start to call friends
You're gonna start to call yourself an addict
You finally read "en and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"
You're gonna clean out your drawers
You're gonna feel much more like God is a mystery
And Jesus is a metaphor
Yeah, you're gonna tell your reflection

It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay (It's gonna be okay)
It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay (It's gonna be okay)

It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay

"Silk Chiffon"
(feat. Phoebe Bridgers)

Sun down and I'm feeling lifted
Downtown, cherry lipstick
Watch her silk dress dancing in the wind
Watch it brush against her skin
Makes me wanna try her on

Like, life's so fun, life's so fun
Got my mini skirt and my rollerblades on
Bag on my side 'cause I'm up 'til dawn
Keeping it light like silk chiffon
Life's so fun, life's so fun
Don't need to worry about no one
She said I got her if I want
She's so soft like silk chiffon

Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me
Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me
(Oh, when she's on)

I'm high and I'm feeling anxious
Inside of the CVS
When she turns 'round halfway down the aisle
With that 'you're on camera' smile
Like she wants to try me on

And life's so fun, life's so fun
Got my mini skirt and my rollerblades on
Bag on my side 'cause I'm up 'til dawn
Keeping it light like silk chiffon
Life's so fun, life's so fun
Don't need to worry about no one
She said that I got her if I want
She's so soft like silk chiffon

Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me
Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me

It feels good to me, it feels good to me
Oo, why wouldn't it be Oo, why wouldn't it be
It feels good to me, it feels good to me
Oo, why wouldn't it be Oo, why wouldn't it be
She's so soft like silk chiffon

Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me
Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me

Oh, when she's on me

"What I Want"

When I go out again
I'm gonna drink a lot
I'm gonna take a shot
'Cause that's just what I want, want, want
What I want, want, want, mmm

And when I see my friend
Put something on her tongue
I'm gonna ask for one
'Cause that's just what I want, want, want
What I want, want, I want

I've spent way too, too, too many years
Not knowing what
What I wanted, how to get it, how to live it and now
I'm gonna make up for it all at once
'Cause that's, that's just what I want

I want the full effects
I wanna hit it hard
I wanna dance in the middle of a gay bar
Ooh, that's what I want
There's nothing wrong
With what I want
Yeah, yeah

I want the fireworks
I want the chemistry
I want that girl right over there to wanna date me
Ooh, that's what I want
There's nothing wrong
With what I want
Yeah, yeah

She's dancing to the song
With all her leather on
I think we'll get along
'Cause she's got what I want, want, want
What I want, want, I want

I've spent way too, too, too many years
Not knowing what
What I wanted, how to get it, how to live it and now
I'm gonna make up for it all at once
'Cause that's, that's just what I want

I want the full effects
I wanna hit it hard
I wanna dance in the middle of a gay bar
Ooh, that's what I want
There's nothing wrong
With what I want
Yeah, yeah

I want the fireworks
I want the chemistry
I want that girl right over there to wanna date me
Ooh, that's what I want
There's nothing wrong
With what I want
Yeah, yeah

My hands are shaking, it's psychosomatic
That's how bad I want what I want
What I want, what I want
I'm gonna take it, I'm just gonna grab it
That's how bad I want what I want
What I want, what I want

I've spent too, too, too many years
I've cried too, too, too many tears
And now I'm gonna make up for it all at once
'Cause that's, that's just what I want

I want the full effects
I wanna hit it hard
I wanna dance in the middle of a gay bar
Ooh, that's what I want
There's nothing wrong
With what I want
Yeah, yeah

I want the fireworks
I want the chemistry
I want that girl right over there to wanna date me
Ooh, that's what I want
There's nothing wrong
With what I want
Yeah, yeah

"Runner's High"

Since I left
I've not been drinking or staying out late
I get up early and I meditate
Paint the walls a different color

I've been doing
Almost everything I wanted to
Shame I couldn't do it with you
Maybe it's just human nature and I

Didn't fake those tears
But I haven't felt like crying
Since I put the car in gear
I've been

Feeling alright
Moving fast so you can't cross my mind
Sometimes I wonder if I'm
On a runner's high

Didn't stay for the fight
Honey, you should see me fly
Since I ran out on you, I'm
On a runner's high

(On a runner's high)

If I regress
And picture you laying with her
You'd think that I'd find it disturbing
But it doesn't really hurt me
I've been

Feeling alright
Moving fast so you can't cross my mind
Sometimes I wonder if I'm
On a runner's high

Didn't stay for the fight
Honey, you should see me fly
Since I ran out on you, I'm
On a runner's high

Hit me so I know I can feel something
You said I'd regret when I was leaving
Funny how a fall can feel just like flying
When I'm waiting for it to

Hit me
(Hit me so I know I can feel something)
But I'm feeling alright
(You said I'd regret when I was leaving
Funny how a fall can feel just like flying)
Am I on a runner's high

"Home By Now"

Heard that you were selling your piano and your car
It feels so weird to not reach out and ask you how you are
I wonder if you're moving or if money's just that tight
These are the kinds of questions to which I've resigned my rights

Ever since
I decided
There were things
That I needed
That you couldn't give to me
But I'm still wondering

Would we have turned a corner if I had waited
Do I need to lower my expectations
If we'd kept heading the same direction
Would we be home by
Now I don't know if I'd been okay with
Holding out hope for your stack of rainchecks
If I had been able to grin and bear it
Would we be home by now

Have you ever heard about how when a person's in a maze
They will tend to walk in circles thinking they are going straight
They can't see the bigger picture so they get stuck in a loop
In the end I was afraid that that's what you and I would do

But I still
Have my moments
Where every reason
Feels a lot like an excuse
I wanna ask you

Would we have turned a corner if I had waited
Do I need to lower my expectations
If we'd kept heading the same direction
Would we be home by
Now I don't know if I'd been okay with
Holding out hope for your stack of rainchecks
If I had been able to grin and bear it
Would we be home by now

What is love supposed to feel like anyway
Why is it so hot in LA
In late October
Said I don't know if it's enough to make it last
You said if I even had to ask
You had your answer
But I still wonder

Would we have turned a corner if I had waited
Do I need to lower my expectations
If we'd kept heading the same direction
Would we be home by
Now I don't know if I'd been okay with
Holding out hope for your stack of rainchecks
If I had been able to grin and bear it
Would we be home by now

"Kind Of Girl"

I'm the kind of girl
Who takes things a little too far
Presses a little too hard
That's why you left a mark and

I'm the kind of girl
Who wants everything she can't get
Leaving alone and yet
Somehow still leaving a mess but

I'm a girl who's learning
Everything I say isn't
Definitive
I'm not some kind of minor trope
Who's never gonna change that's so
Derivative

I could get up tomorrow
Talk to myself real gentle
Work in the garden
Go out and meet somebody
Who actually likes me for me
And this time I'll let them
Yeah, I like telling stories
But I don't have to write them in ink
I could still change the end
At least I'm the kind of girl
I'm the kind of girl who thinks I can
The kind of girl who thinks I can

I'm the kind of girl
Who's likely to drive you insane
Restless forever untamed
A little in love with the pain but

I'm the kind of girl
Who owns up to all of my faults
Who's learning to laugh at 'em all
Like I'm not a problem to solve

I'm a girl who's blowing on a dandelion
Thinkin' how the winds could change at
Any given time

I could get up tomorrow
Talk to myself real gentle
Work in the garden
Go out and meet somebody
Who actually likes me for me
And this time I'll let them
Yeah, I like telling stories
But I don't have to write them in ink
I could still change the end
At least I'm the kind of girl
I'm the kind of girl who thinks I can
The kind of girl who thinks I can

"Handle Me"

Who taught you that
If you get a good thing
You better not touch it too much
Who taught you that
You got to keep your hands clean
Or you're gonna mess it all up

I am not a brand-new bicycle
I am rough around the edge
I am not a flower petal

You can handle me
You can handle me
Put your hands on me
Well, you can handle me

What got you thinkin'
If you love someone
It's best to just leave 'em alone
Look how you got me
You've got me reelin'
Waiting for you to come over

And put me to a higher purpose
Bend me back and send me flyin'
I'm not gonna break, I promise

You can handle me
You can handle me
Put your hands on me
You can handle me

Kiss me under my right ear
Running your fingers down the back of my spine
Handle me
Grab a fistful of my hair
Trace me like an outline
Handle me
Flip me onto my left side
So we can intertwine and
Handle me
Hold me like you're the tie that binds
Spread this out across time and
Handle me

"No Idea"

I think you think I'm like a virgin
Not in a biblical sense
You think I'm nervous and uncertain
Because I'm waiting

You seem like such a good thing, a good thing
I know that good things take time
I keep it so clean, so clean
But baby in the back of my mind

You have no idea, you have no idea
The things I think about you when you aren't here
You have no idea, you have no idea
But when you find out it's all you're gonna hear

Ringing in your ears
Ooh
I'll be ringing in your ears
Ooh

There is a ring around my finger
Left when I pulled it from my lips
You see me unfolding a napkin
You see me give it a kiss

And you have no idea, you have no idea
The things I think about you when you aren't here
You have no idea, you have no idea
But when you find out it's all you're gonna hear

Ringing in your ears
Ooh
I'll be ringing in your ears
Ooh

You think I'm such a good thing, a good thing
You have no idea
You think I'm such a good thing, a good thing

You have no idea
The things I think about you
When you find out it's all you're gonna hear
So tell me when you want to
Come and find out
Leave me ringing in your

"Solid"

She is not a screen on which you project
She is not a scene on your movie set
She is not a mirror in which you reflect
Yeah, she is of material substance

She's so, so, so solid
(She's so solid, my baby, she's so solid)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
My baby's so solid
(She's so solid, my baby, she's so solid)
She's so, so, so solid
(She's so solid, my baby, she's so solid)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
My baby's so solid, so solid

She is like a bullet in between your eyes
She is fully loaded and pressurized
She is like a pearl coming out the shell
Yeah, you can tell she made herself all by herself

She's so, so, so solid
(She's so solid, my baby, she's so solid)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
My baby's so solid
(She's so solid, my baby, she's so solid)
She's so, so, so solid
(She's so solid, my baby, she's so solid)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
My baby's so solid, so solid

She's making a plan
She's taking it higher
She's using her hands
She's pulling the levers
She's dotting her Is
She's checking the levels
She's using her mind
She's doing better

She's so solid
(So solid, my baby, she's so solid)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
My baby's so solid

Yeah, yeah, yeah
My baby's so solid, so solid

"Anything But Me"

You're gonna say that I'm on a high horse
I think that my horse is regular-sized
Did you ever think maybe
You're on a pony
Going in circles on a carousel ride
You're gonna say I asked for the moon
I think that it's you with your head in the sky
All that I wanted was somebody honest
Living for more than their next good time

You say that you wanna change
Well, I hope you get everything you want
Everything you want
You say that you need relief
Well, I hope you get everything you need
Everything but me
'Cause I don't wanna stick around trying to work it out
When everything feels wrong
Everything feels wrong
But it's all love and it's no regrets
You can call me if there's anything you need
Anything, anything but

Me, me yeah
Me, me yeah
Me, me yeah
Anything you need
Anything but me

Go ahead and hate me as long as you need to
Go ahead and break me a piece of your mind
Say I always had one foot out
Well, baby, I got two now
Good thing I've never been afraid of goodbye

You say that you wanna change
Well, I hope you get everything you want
Everything you want
You say that you need relief
Well, I hope you get everything you need
Everything but me
'Cause I don't wanna stick around trying to work it out
When everything feels wrong
Everything feels wrong
But it's all love and it's no regrets
You can call me if there's anything you need
Anything, anything but

Me, me yeah
Me, me yeah
Me, me yeah
Anything you need
Anything but me

And sure, it's not all so black and white
Sure, I'm gonna cry
For the love we couldn't keep
But I would rather lose you
Than who I'm meant to be
So you can have anything but

Me, me yeah
Me, me yeah
Me, me yeah
Anything you need
Anything but
Me, me yeah
Me, me yeah
Me, me yeah
Anything you need
Anything but me

"Loose Garment"

I knew before it started
This August would be a hard one
Late summer love sprung up between us
Didn't last through the seasons

I'm broken hearted, I'm disappointed
It was still beautiful
Took myself out to dinner and
Cried about you on the way home

Used to wear my sadness like a choker
Yeah, it had me by the throat
Tonight I feel I'm draped in it
Like a loose garment
I just let it flow

I could come up with reasons I didn't love you well enough
Shooting a second arrow into the hole where the first was

We've paid in pain
Now we'll keep the change
The blame is for the birds (The blame is for the birds)
I'll break it up in pieces and feed it to them by the river

Used to wear my sadness like a choker
Yeah, it had me by the throat
Tonight I feel I'm draped in it
Like a loose garment
I just let it flow

"Shooting Star"

I heard there's a few different people you're talking to
I wonder if you lose track of them some of the time
I'm laughing 'cause I know I only just met you
But you're already spanning skylines inside of my mind

And tonight when I closed that door
I wanted to turn back
But when I see a shooting star
I stay out of its path

And that's what you are
You're so bright
You'd burn my eyes
And you'd move too fast
So I say goodnight
Make it home
Like I'm making a wish
On you, from afar
You, my shooting star

I know what you wanted because I wanted it too
To be in your light, consumed and erased
But your light doesn't stay, you'd take it away too soon
You'd leave me hung over the moon, stranded in space

So even though tonight when I closed that door
I wanted to turn back
I know when I see a shooting star
To stay out of its path

And that's what you are
You're so bright
You'd burn my eyes
And you'd move too fast
So I say goodnight
Make it home
Like I'm making a wish
On you, from afar
You, my shooting

Starlight, star bright
The only star I see tonight
I wish I may
And I think I might regret this either way
If I let you in my heart
Or keep you in the dark
So I love you from afar
You, my shooting star

"2BMoved"

Yes or no
Make the choice
That's the way it's always been
In my head
All the noise
Clouding my judgement
Then you crossed into my line of vision and suddenly
I don't even have to think or know

I move to touch ya
I move to hold ya, in my hands
I move to move ya
I move to make your river bend
As I move towards ya
I lose all fear of giving in
You're my compulsion
Your water turns me into sand

In a wave of emotion

And if I tried to turn away
Too ashamed of my feelings
In my dreams
You would stay
Deep inside the current
This is bigger than my being
Bigger than morality
When you're standing next to me

I'm just moved to touch ya
I'm moved to hold ya, in my hands
I'm moved to move ya
I'm moved to make your river bend
As I move towards ya
I lose all fear of giving in
You're my compulsion
Your water turns me into sand

In a wave of emotion

You're my way to be moved
I've been waiting to be moved
You're my way to be moved

I've been waiting to be moved to touch ya
I move to hold ya, in my hands
I move to move ya
I move to make your river bend
As I move towards ya
I lose all fear of giving in
You're my compulsion
Your water turns me into sand
In a wave of emotion

"Bad At Letting Go"

That precious piece of time where
Nobody even knows yet
Guess you call that a secret
And I wanna keep it as long as I can
I don't wanna change no plans

I'm surfing on the surface
Cause deeper makes me nervous
Internalize on purpose
I'll deal with it when I get in my bed
I don't wanna go there yet

My night just took a detour
Slide in through the back door

Dancing in the bar
The boys have all turned to shapes
Cursing in the dark
And no one heard anything

It's like lighting a match that you don't ever throw
I'm good at getting attached
And bad at letting go

Someone hold my heart
Cause right now it's killing me
Drinks are hitting hard
But I can feel everything

It's like lighting a match that you don't ever throw
I'm good at getting attached
And bad at letting go

And bad at letting go

I'm finding it convenient
That if I keep on moving
Nobody's gonna see them
The tears that are slipping right off of my skin
T don't want 'em to sink in

My night just took a detour
Slide in through the back door

Dancing in the bar
The boys have all turned to shapes
Cursing in the dark
And no one heard anything

It's like lighting a match that you don't ever throw
I'm good at getting attached
And bad at letting go

Someone hold my heart
Cause right now it's killing me
Drinks are hitting hard
But I can feel everything

It's like lighting a match that you don't ever throw
I'm good at getting attached
And bad at letting go

"Feel Better"

Well I know that you heard what I said
Why don't you tell me where you'll be tonight
I wanna show you what's inside my head
You won't have to tell me what you like
I think I got a way of knowin' what you like
I listen with my fingers

Oh, oh
You don't need to make a sound
I know how it feels
I know just how it feels
Oh, oh
You don't need to make a sound
I know how it feels
And I'll always wanna make it feel
Better
Better
Better
Better

Well you know I hear what they say
I shouldn't have to tell you it ain't right
But when the bullshit's got you losing it
And you're just too tired to try
I will let you cry
Right here, inside my arms

Oh, oh
You don't need to make a sound
I know how it feels
I know just how it feels
Oh, oh
You don't need to make a sound
I know how it feels
And I'll always wanna make it feel
Better

Oh, yeah
Come on, come on, girl

Oh, yeah
Come on, come on, girl

Oh, yeah
Come on, come on, girl

Oh, yeah
Come on, come on, girl

Oh, yeah
Come on, come on, girl

Oh, oh
You don't need to make a sound
I know how it feels
I know just how it feels
Oh, oh
You don't need to make a sound
I know how it feels
And I'll always wanna make it feel
Better

Oh, oh
You don't need to make a sound
I know how it feels
I know just how it feels
Oh, oh
You don't need to make a sound
I know how it feels
And I'll always wanna make it feel
Better
Better
Better
Better

"Honey"

And even if I am not alone
I know I'll hold heart close
I know I'll hold heart close

In the shade, in the shade
In the sun, in the sun, oh-ooh
It's the same, it's the same
Honey, sweet honey
Sweet
Sweet
Sweet
Sweet

I couldn't care for you I said and I turned away
"You love that honeydew, do you"
"I do," I dare say
That even with all eyes on our hands
I know I'll gladly stand
I know I'll gladly stand

In the shade, in the shade
In the sun, in the sun, oh-ooh
It's the same, it's the same
Honey, sweet honey
Sweet
Sweet
Sweet
Sweet

In the shade in the shade, ooh-ooh
In the sun in the sun, ooh-whoa
I'm amazed, you're made of honey
Sweet honey
Sweet
Sweet
Sweet
Sweet

"I Know A Place (MNEK Remix)"

[Katie Gavin]
I knew
When you told me you don't wanna go home tonight
And you tried to just shrug it off when I asked you why
Somebody hurt you
Somebody hurt you
But you're here by my side
And I knew
'Cause I can recall when I was the one in your seat
I still got the scars and they occasionally bleed
Cause somebody hurt me
Somebody hurt me
But I'm staying alive

And I can tell
When you get nervous
You think being yourself
Means being unworthy
And it's hard to love
With a heart that's hurting
But if you want to go out dancing

I know a place (ooh)
I know a place we can go (yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Just give me trust and watch what'll happen
'Cause I know (ooh)
I know a place we can run (yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Don't you be afraid of love and affection
Just lay down your weapon

[MNEK]
Right now
It's like you're carrying all the weight of your past
I see all your bruises, yellow, dark blue, and black
But baby a bruise is, only your body
Tryna keep you intact
[Katie Gavin]
So right now
I think we should go get drunk on cheap wine
I think we should hop on the purple line
'Cause maybe our purpose
Is to never give up when we're on the right track

[Katie Gavin & MNEK]
And I can tell
When you get nervous
You think being yourself
Means being unworthy
And it's hard to love
With a heart that's hurting
But if you want to go out dancing

I know a place (ooh)
I know a place we can go (we can go)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Just give me trust and watch what'll happen
'Cause I know (ooh)
I know a place we can run (we can run, yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Don't you be afraid of love and affection
Just lay down your weapon

[Katie Gavin]
Lay down your weapon
Lay down your weapon
I, I know a place we can go
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
[MNEK] Just give me trust, give me trust, give me trust

[Katie Grand & MNEK]
'Cause I know (ooh)
I know a place we can go (we can go, yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon (yeah)
Just give me trust and watch what'll happen
'Cause I know (I know)
I know a place we can stay (yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon (lay down)
Lay down their weapon (lay down)
Don't you be afraid of love and affection
Just lay down your weapon

"In My Way"

Red, red rover, why don't you come on over
Why the hell has it been so long, oh
Wait, never mind that
I know that that's my bad
For a while, I thought I should leave you alone

Cause I didn't like the way that you make me cry
But the way you make me come makes it all alright

I'm not afraid to say-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay
I love you in my way-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay
I'm not afraid to say-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay
I love you in my way-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay

You call me a weirdo
You're happy to be here, though
I keep beating on your body, baby
When we get to it
Ooh the way we do it
Got me feeling like it's all gonna be okay

When it unfurls
It's a sick, sad world
But I'm your girl
Even when I'm not your girl

I'm not afraid to say-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay
I love you in my way-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay
I'm not afraid to say-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay
I love you in my way-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay

Even if, if it doesn't all go my way
Even if, if it doesn't all go my way
Even if, if it doesn't all go my way
Even if, if it doesn't all go my way

I'm not afraid to say-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay
I love you in my way-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay
I'm not afraid to say-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay
I love you in my way-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay

"Maximum"

Ego, ego
Now I have done it again
I've forgotten what it is to be human
I am energy
I am nothing greater than
What I give and what I take from another one

You are the moon, I am the moon
You are the sun, I am the sun
You got me riding on your flow
We're on our way
To the maximum

Syne-Synergy
You have shown me much of it
You reflect it in my heart like a diamond
There is beauty moving underneath our skin
When we open up our minds in unison

You are the moon, I am the moon
You are the sun, I am the sun
You got me riding on your flow
We're on our way
To the maximum

You are the moon, I am the moon
You are the sun, I am the sun
You got me riding on your flow
We're on our way
To the maximum

And if you push, then I will pull
And if you go, I will follow
And if you pull, then I will push
And if you go, I will follow

You
Are the moon, I am the moon
You are the sun, I am the sun
You got me riding on your flow
We're on our way
To the maximum

You
Are the moon, I am the moon
You are the sun, I am the sun
You got me riding on your flow
We're on our way
To the maximum

"Nihilist"
(from "Promising Young Woman" soundtrack)

If anyone is making this, count me with a nihilist tonight
Out on 23rd and Fig, half naked, and drunk, and high

And when I come through swinging, you can hear me singing

Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters
Because if it did, I couldn't handle it

And anyone can have a go
If you wanna touch me, let me know
And when I'm at my lowest low, that's when I'm most comfortable

And when I come through swinging, you can hear me singing
And on the pavement later, you can hear me whisper

Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters
Because if it did, I couldn't handle it

So kill me with a nihilist, tonight, I guess
You can kill me with the nihilist tonight
So kill me the nihilist, tonight, I guess
You can kill me with the nihilist

Pour me one more or whatever
Pour me one more or whatever
Nothing really matters, really matters
Pour me one more or whatever
Pour me one more or whatever
Nothing really matters, really matters

So kill me with the nihilist, tonight, I guess
You can kill me with the nihilist tonight
Kill me with the nihilist, tonight, I guess
You can kill me with the nihilist tonight

"One That Got Away"

I'm the one
Who opened up, ready for a connection
I'm the one
Brave enough to say how I was feeling
I'm the one waiting by the phone
The one who is home alone
'Til I realized you were only messing around
Yeah, you played it like a game
Never called it by its name
Isn't it a shame how

Now I'm the one that got away
The kiss you never tasted
Tell me that you hate it
Hate that I'm no longer in your reach
If I can't hear you say it
Maybe you can't change it, but if you never
If you never put it on the line
How am I gonna sign for it
Yeah, you never
You never let me know I'm what you want
Maybe that's why I'm the one
The one that got away
The kiss you never tasted
Now I'm the one that got away
Tell me that you hate it

I'm the one
Who's crying over you in a bath on the weekend
But I'm the one
Who isn't scared to dive into love on the deep end
You're the one lying to your friends
You're the one who can't pretend
That there are no consequences to what you do
But the truth is that it's costly
Baby, 'cause you lost me
Soon enough you're gonna see

That I'm the one that got away
The kiss you never tasted
Tell me that you hate it
Hate that I'm no longer in your reach
If I can't hear you say it
Maybe you can't change it, but if you never (If you never, if you never)
If you never put it on the line
How am I gonna sign for it
Yeah, you never
You never let me know I'm what you want
Maybe that's why

The one that got away
The kiss you never tasted
Tell me that you hate it
Hate that I'm no longer in your reach (Your reach)
If I can't hear you say it
Maybe you can't change it, but if you never

If you never put it on the line
How am I gonna sign for it
Yeah, you never
You never let me know I'm what you want
Maybe that's why I'm
The one that got away
The kiss you never tasted
Now I'm the one that got away
Tell me that you hate it

"The Grave"

There is a spiral
In the way back
Of your mind
Waiting for attention
There is a pathway
Way down to
The dark
Built for destruction

But if you can
Push past
Everything you buried in the ashes
Feel it
Breathing

All along the life was there
(All along, ah)
Fruit so sweet you're scared to bear it
(Fruit so sweet you're, ah)

All long the life was there
Fruit so sweet you're scared to
Bear it
Yeah-yeah

There is a cherry tree
With no leaves
On the grave you dug your dreams
Somebody told you, save the sun for
More blessed, more perfect beings

But if you rise on your knees
Mourn the love you did not receive
Open knotted limbs and begin to
Breathe the light that you could not see
You'll
Feel it
Growing

All along the life was there
(All along, ah)
Fruit so sweet you're scared to bear it
(Fruit so sweet you're, ah)

All long the life was there
Fruit so sweet you're
Scared to
Bear it
Yeah-yeah

Sweet dreams
You deserve

Sweet dreams
You deserve

Sweet dreams
You deserve

Sweet dreams
You deserve

"Winterbreak (Tisto's Deep House Remix)"
(with Tisto)

You say
I say
Last time
This time
You say I'd best be going cause it's getting late
And I say
Why don't I walk you home cause it's on the way
But the last time
That we made love, you left in tears
So this time
You're wondering how to leave it here
And I haven't seen you since last winter break
And I know that I broke your heart
But always such a smart one, always so intelligent
You must know that I took it hard

Oh, baby I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try
You say
I say
Last time
This time

You pull
That face like, 'here we go again'
So I pull
A flask out the back of my jeans
And then you take a pull
And in my mind we're in my bed
And I'm pulling
Your sweater up over your head
And I haven't seen you since last winter break
And I know that you hate how that went
But always such a smart one, always so intelligent
You must know what's happening

Oh it's magnetic, isn't it
The sense of something underneath the surface
When you're laying on thin ice
Just a little bit masochistic
A tentative ellipses
The parting of your lips and the ache in your eyes
But I think I'm gonna kiss you

Oh, baby, I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try

Oh, baby, I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try

You say
I say
Last time
This time

"I Had A King"

I had a king in a tenement castle
Lately he's taken to painting the pastel walls brown
He's taken the curtains down
He's swept with the broom of contempt
And the rooms have an empty ring 
He's cleaned with the tears 
Of an actor who fears for the laughter's sting 

I can't go back there anymore 
You know my keys won't fit the door 
You know my thoughts don't fit the man 
They never can they never can

I had a king dressed in drip-dry and paisley 
Lately he's taken to saying I'm crazy and blind 
He lives in another time 
Ladies in gingham still blush 
While he sings them of wars and wine 
But I in my leather and lace 
I can never become that kind 

I can't go back there anymore 
You know my keys won't fit the door 
You know my thoughts don't fit the man 
They never can they never can

I had a king in a salt-rusted carriage 
Who carried me off to his country for marriage too soon
Beware of the power of moons
There's no one to blame
No there's no one to name as a traitor here 
The king's on the road
And the queen's in the grove till the end of the year

I can't go back there anymore 
You know my keys won't fit the door 
You know my thoughts don't fit the man 
They never can they never can
They never can they never can

"Michael From Mountains"

Michael wakes you up with sweets
He takes you up streets and the rain comes down
Sidewalk markets locked up tight
And umbrellas bright on a grey background
There's oil on the puddles in taffeta patterns
That run down the drain
In colored arrangements
That Michael will change with a stick that he found

Michael from mountains
Go where you will go to
Know that I will know you
Someday I may know you very well

Michael brings you to a park
He sings and it's dark when the clouds come by
Yellow slickers up on swings
Like puppets on strings hanging in the sky
They'll splash home to suppers in wallpapered kitchens
Their mothers will scold
But Michael will hold you
To keep away cold till the sidewalks are dry-

Michael from mountains
Go where you will go to
Know that I will know you
Someday I may know you very well

Michael leads you up the stairs
He needs you to care and you know you do
Cats come crying to the key
And dry you will be in a towel or two
There's rain in the window
There's sun in the painting that smiles on the wall
You want to know all
But his mountains have called so you never do-

Michael from mountains
Go where you will go to
Know that I will know you
Someday I may know you very well

"Night In The City"

Light up light up
Light up your lazy blue eyes
Moon's up nights up
Taking the town by surprise
Night time night time
Day left an hour ago
City light time
Must you get ready so slow
There are places to come from and places to go

Night in the city looks pretty to me
Night in the city looks fine
Music comes spilling out into the street
Colors go flashing in time

Take off take off
Take off your stay-at-home shoes
Break off shake off
Chase off those stay-at-home blues
Stairway stairway
Down to the crowds in the street
They go their way
Looking for faces to greet
But we run on laughing with no one to meet

Night in the city looks pretty to me
Night in the city looks fine
Music comes spilling out into the street
Colors go waltzing in time

"Marcie"

Marcie in a coat of flowers
Stops inside a candy store
Reds are sweet and greens are sour
Still no letter at her door
So she'll wash her flower curtains
Hang them in the wind to dry
Dust her tables with his shirt and
Wave another day goodbye

Marcie's faucet needs a plumber
Marcie's sorrow needs a man
Red is autumn green is summer
Greens are turning and the sand
All along the ocean beaches
Stares up empty at the sky
Marcie buys a bag of peaches
Stops a postman passing by
And summer goes
Falls to the sidewalk like string and brown paper
Winter blows
Up from the river there's no one to take her
To the sea

Marcie dresses warm it's snowing
Takes a yellow cab uptown
Red is stop and green's for going
Sees a show and rides back down
Down along the Hudson River
Past the shipyards in the cold
Still no letter's been delivered
Still the winter days unfold
Like magazines
Fading in dusty grey attics and cellars
Make a dream
Dream back to summer and hear how he tells her
Wait for me

Marcie leaves and doesn't tell us
Where or why she moved away
Red is angry green is jealous
That was all she had to say
Someone thought they saw her Sunday
Window shopping in the rain
Someone heard she bought a one-way ticket
And went west again

"Nathan La Franeer"

I hired a coach to take me from confusion to the plane
And though we shared a common space I know I'll never meet again
The driver with his eyebrows furrowed in the rear-view mirror
I read his name and it was plainly written Nathan La Franeer
I asked him would he hurry
But we crawled the canyons slowly
Thru the buyers and the sellers
Thru the burglar bells and the wishing wells
With gangs and girly shows
The ghostly garden grows

The cars and buses bustled thru the bedlam of the day
I looked thru window-glass at streets and Nathan grumbled at the grey
I saw an aging cripple selling Superman balloons
The city grated thru chrome-plate
The clock struck slowly half-past-noon
Thru the tunnel tiled and turning
Into daylight once again I am escaping
Once again goodbye
To symphonies and dirty trees
With parks and plastic clothes
The ghostly garden grows

He asked me for a dollar more
He cursed me to my face
He hated everyone who paid to ride
And share his common space
I picked my bags up from the curb
And stumbled to the door
Another man reached out his hand
Another hand reached out for more
And I filled it full of silver
And I left the fingers counting
And the sky goes on forever
Without meter maids and peace parades

You feed it all your woes
The ghostly garden grows

"Sisotowbell Lane"

Sisotowbell Lane
Noah is fixing the pump in the rain
He brings us no shame
We always knew that he always knew
Up over the hill
Jovial neighbors come down when they will
With stories to tell
Sometimes they do
Yes sometimes we do
We have a rocking chair
Each of us rocks his share
Eating muffin buns and berries
By the steamy kitchen window
Sometimes we do
Our tongues turn blue
Sisotowbell Lane
Anywhere else now would seem very strange
The seasons are changing
Everyday in everyway
Sometimes it is spring
Sometimes it is not anything
A poet can sing
Sometimes we try
Yes we always try
We have a rocking chair
Somedays we rock and stare
At the woodlands and the grasslands and the badlands 'cross the river
Sometimes we do
We like the view
Sisotowbell Lane
Go to the city you'll come back again
To wade thru the grain
You always do
Yes we always do
Come back to the stars
Sweet well water and pickling jars
We'll lend you the car
We always do
Yes sometimes we do
We have a rocking chair
Someone is always there
Rocking rhythms while they're waiting with the candle in the window
Sometimes we do
We wait for you

"The Dawntreader"

Peridots and periwinkle blue medallions
Gilded galleons spilled across the ocean floor
Treasure somewhere in the sea and he will find where
Never mind their questions there's no answer for
The roll of the harbor wake
The songs that the rigging makes
The taste of the spray he takes
And he learns to give
He aches and he learns to live
He stakes all his silver
On a promise to be free
Mermaids live in colonies
All his seadreams come to me

City satins left at home I will not need them
I believe him when he tells of loving me
Something truthful in the sea your lies will find you
Leave behind your streets he said and come to me
Come down from the neon nights
Come down from the tourist sights
Run down till the rain delights you
You do not hide
Sunlight will renew your pride
Skin white by skin golden
Like a promise to be free
Dolphins playing in the sea
All his seadreams come to me

Seabird I have seen you fly above the pilings
I am smiling at your circles in the air
I will come and sit by you while he lies sleeping
Fold your fleet wings I have brought some dreams to share
A dream that you love someone
A dream that the wars are done
A dream that you tell no one but the grey sea
They'll say that you're crazy
And a dream of a baby
Like a promise to be free
Children laughing out to sea
All his seadreams come to me

"The Pirate Of Penance"

[PENANCE CRANE]
The pirate anchored on a Wednesday
And why he came to port I wonder
To see a lady so my friends say
She dances for the sailors
In a smoky cabaret bar underground
Down in a cellar in a harbor town
I know he told her love was treasure
And they would reap the fullest bounty
He only comes to port for pleasure
So when the winds of morning
Blew the curtains in she woke and found he'd gone
I saw his sails unfurling Thursday dawn
The pirate he will sink you with a kiss
He'll steal your heart and sail away

[THE DANCER]
Saturday early we met in the cove near the forest

[PENANCE]
He'll leave you drowning in the flotsam of a broken promise in the bay

[THE DANCER]
(Dancing we wakened the dawn and the birds into chorus)

[PENANCE]
He came again to see her
Yes I think they told me it was Saturday

[THE DANCER]
(Ask Penance Crane she was out in her garden she saw us)

[PENANCE]
I was at sea then
I didn't see them
I don't believe what you are saying
It isn't true I hardly knew him
Is this some game that you are playing
Go ask the dancer she's the one who saw him last
The one who drew him here
He hasn't come to me since spring last year
There was a time when he would
Bring me silks and sandalwood and Persian lace

[THE DANCER]
(Then came another "goodbye" and another "Please don't go")

[PENANCE]
And he would hold me close
And tell my sailing stories by the fireplace

[THE DANCER]
(All night I dance and all day I keep watch with my sorrow)

[PENANCE]
I was at sea I tell you I was
Nowhere near the mentioned murder place

[THE DANCER]
(Searching for sails that don't come
And I guess but I don't know)

[PENANCE]
Go ask the dancer
She knows the answer

[THE DANCER]
I don't know

[PENANCE]
She knows the answer

[THE DANCER]
I don't know

[PENANCE]
She knows the answer

[THE DANCER]
I don't know

"Song To A Seagull"

Fly silly seabird
No dreams can possess you
No voices can blame you
For sun on your wings
My gentle relations
Have names they must call me
For loving the freedom
Of all flying things
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach out of cry

I came to the city
And lived like old Crusoe
On an island of noise
In a cobblestone sea
And the beaches were concrete
And the stars paid a light bill
And the blossoms hung false
On their store window trees
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach out of cry

Out of the city
And down to the seaside
To sun on my shoulders
And wind in my hair
But sandcastles crumble
And hunger is human
And humans are hungry
For worlds they can't share
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach out of cry

I call to a seagull
Who dives to the waters
And catches his silver-fine
Dinner alone
Crying where are the footprints
That danced on these beaches
And the hands that cast wishes
That sunk like a stone
My dreams with the seagulls fly
Out of reach, out of cry

"Cactus Tree"

There's a man who's been out sailing
In a decade full of dreams
And he takes her to a schooner
And he treats her like a queen
Bearing beads from California
With their amber stones and green

He has called her from the harbor
He has kissed her with his freedom
He has heard her off to starboard
In the breaking and the breathing
Of the water weeds

While she was busy being free

There's a man who's climbed a mountain
And he's calling out her name
And he hopes her heart can hear
Three thousand miles he calls again
He can think her there beside him
He can miss her just the same

He has missed her in the forest
While he showed her all the flowers
And the branches sang the chorus
As he climbed the scaly towers
Of a forest tree

While she was somewhere being free

There's a man who's sent a letter and he's waiting for reply
He has asked her of her travels since the day they said goodbye
He writes, "Wish you were beside me, we can make it if we try."

He has seen her at the office
With her name on all these papers
Through the sharing of the profits
He will find it hard to shake her
From his memory

And she's so busy being free

There's a lady, in the city
And she thinks she loves them all
There's the one who's thinking of her
There's the one who sometimes calls
There's the one who writes her letters
With his facts and figures scrawl

She has brought them to her senses
They have laughed inside her laughter
Now she rallies her defenses
For she fears that one will ask her
For eternity

And she's so busy being free

There's a man who sends her medals
He is bleeding from the war
There's a jouster and a jester
And a man who owns a store
There's a drummer, and a dreamer
And you know there may be more

She will love them when she sees them
They will lose her if they follow
And she only means to please them
And her heart is full and hollow
Like a cactus tree

While she's so busy being free

Like a cactus tree
Being free

"Tin Angel"

Varnished weeds in window jars
Tarnished beads on tapestries
Kept in satin boxes are
Reflections of love's memories

Letters from across the seas
Roses dipped in sealing wax
Valentines and maple leaves
Tucked into a paperback

Guess I'll throw them all away
I found someone to love today

Dark with darker moods is he
Not a golden Prince who's come
Through columbines and wizardry
To talk of castles in the sun

Still I'll take a chance and see
I found someone to love today

There's a sorrow in his eyes
Like the angel made of tin
What will happen if I try
To place another heart in him

In a Bleecker Street cafe
I found someone to love today
I found someone to love today

"Chelsea Morning"

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I heard
Was a song outside my window, and the traffic wrote the words
It came a-reeling up like Christmas bells, and rapping up like pipes and drums

Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll wear it 'till the night comes

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I saw
Was the sun through yellow curtains, and a rainbow on the wall
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you, crimson crystal beads to beckon

Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
There's a sun show every second

Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today
And the streets are paved with passersby
And pigeons fly
And papers lie
Waiting to blow away

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I knew
There was milk and toast and honey and a bowl of oranges, too
And the sun poured in like butterscotch and stuck to all my senses
Oh, won't you stay
We'll put on the day
And we'll talk in present tenses

When the curtain closes and the rainbow runs away
I will bring you incense owls by night
By candlelight
By jewel-light
If only you will stay
Pretty baby, won't you
Wake up, it's a Chelsea morning

"I Don't Know Where I Stand"

Funny day, looking for laughter and finding it there
Sunny day, braiding wild flowers and leaves in my hair
Picked up a pencil and wrote "I love you" in my finest hand
Wanted to send it, but I don't know where I stand

Telephone, even the sound of your voice is still new
All alone in California and talking to you
And feeling too foolish and strange to say the words that I had planned
I guess it's too early, 'cause I don't know where I stand

Crickets call, courting their ladies in star-dappled green
Thickets tall, until the morning comes up like a dream
All muted and misty, so drowsy now I'll take what sleep I can
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand
I know that I miss you, but I don't know where I stand

"That Song About The Midway"

I met you on a midway at a fair last year
And you stood out like a ruby in a black man's ear
You were playing on the horses, you were playing on the guitar strings
You were playing like a devil wearing wings, wearing wings
You looked so grand wearing wings
Do you tape them to your shoulders just to sing
Can you fly
I heard you can Can you fly
Like an eagle doin' your hunting from the sky

I followed with the sideshows to another town
And I found you in a trailer on the camping grounds
You were betting on some lover, you were shaking up the dice
And I thought I saw you cheating once or twice, once or twice

I heard your bid once or twice
Were you wondering was the gamble worth the price
Pack it in
I heard you did Pack it in
Was it hard to fold a hand you knew could win

So lately you've been hiding - it was somewhere in the news
And I'm still at these races with my ticket stubs and my blues
And a voice calls out the numbers, and it sometimes mentions mine
And I feel like I've been working overtime, overtime

I've lost my fire overtime
Always playin' one more hand for one more dime
Slowin' down I'm gettin' tired
Slowin' down
And I envy you the valley that you've found
'Cause I'm midway down the midway
Slowin' down, down, down, down

"Roses Blue"

I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles
I think of rain, I think of roses blue
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble
To see the place she's lately gotten to
Gotten to, gotten to

She's gotten to mysterious devotions
She's gotten to the zodiac and en
She's gotten into tarot cards and potions
She's laying her religion on her friends
On her friends, on her friends

Friends who come to ask her for their future
Friends who come to find they can't be friends
Because of signs and seasons that don't suit her
She'll prophesy your death, she won't say when
Won't say when, won't say when

When all the black cards come you cannot barter
No, when all your stars are stacked you cannot win
She'll shake her head and treat you like a martyr
It is her blackest spell she puts you in
Puts you in, puts you in

In sorrow she can lure you where she wants you
Inside your own self-pity there you swim
In sinking down to drown her voice still haunts you
And only with your laughter can you win
Can you win, can you win

You win the lasting laurels with your laughter
It reaches like an arm before you sink
To win the solitary truth you're after
You dare not ask the priestess how to think
How to think, how to think

I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles
I think of rain, I think of roses blue
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble
To see the place she's lately gotten to
Gotten to, gotten to

"The Gallery"

When I first saw your gallery
I liked the ones of ladies
Then you began to hang up me
You studied to portray me
In ice and greens
And old blue jeans
And naked in the roses
Then you got into funny scenes
That all your work discloses

"Lady, don't love me now I am dead
I am a saint, turn down your bed
I have no heart," that's what you said
You said, "I can be cruel
But let me be gentle with you"

Somewhere in a magazine
I found a page about you
I see that now it's Josephine
Who cannot be without you
I keep your house in fit repair
I dust the portraits daily
Your mail comes here from everywhere
The writing looks like ladies'

"Lady, please love me now, I am dead
I am a saint, turn down your bed
I have no heart," that's what you said
You said, "I can be cruel
But let me be gentle with you"

I gave you all my pretty years
Then we began to weather
And I was left to winter here
While you went west for pleasure
And now you're flying back this way
Like some lost homing pigeon
They've monitored your brain, you say
And changed you with religion

"Lady, please love me now I was dead
I am no saint, turn down your bed
Lady, have you no heart," that's what you said
Well, I can be cruel
But let me be gentle with you

When I first saw your gallery
I liked the ones of ladies
But now their faces follow me
And all their eyes look shady

"I Think I Understand"

Daylight falls upon the path, the forest falls behind
Today I am not prey to dark uncertainty
The shadow trembles in its wrath, I've robbed its blackness blind
And tasted sunlight as my fear came clear to me

I think I understand
Fear is like a wilderland
Stepping stones or sinking sand

Now the way leads to the hills, above the steeple's chime
Below me sleepy rooftops round the harbor
It's there I'll take my thirsty fill of friendship over wine
Forgetting fear but never disregarding her

Oh, I think I understand
Fear is like a wilderland
Stepping stones and sinking sand

Sometimes voices in the night will call me back again
Back along the pathway of a troubled mind
When forests rise to block the light that keeps a traveler sane
I'll challenge them with flashes from a brighter time

Oh, I think I understand
Fear is like a wilderland
Stepping stones or sinking sand

"Songs To Aging Children Come"

Through the windless wells of wonder
By the throbbing light machine
In a tea leaf trance or under
Orders from the king and queen

Songs to aging children come
Aging children, I am one

People hurry by so quickly
Don't they hear the melodies
In the chiming and the clicking
And the laughing harmonies

Songs to aging children come
Aging children, I am one

Some come dark and strange like dying
Crows and ravens whistling
Lines of weeping, strings of crying
So much said in listening

Songs to aging children come
Aging children, I am one

Does the moon play only silver
When it strums the galaxy
Dying roses will they will their
Perfumed rhapsodies to me

Songs to aging children come
This is one

"The Fiddle And The Drum"

And so once again
My dear Johnny my dear friend
And so once again you are fightin' us all
And when I ask you why
You raise your sticks and cry, and I fall
Oh, my friend
How did you come
To trade the fiddle for the drum

You say I have turned
Like the enemies you've earned
But I can remember
All the good things you are
And so I ask you please
Can I help you find the peace and the star
Oh, my friend
What time is this
To trade the handshake for the fist

And so once again
Oh, America my friend
And so once again
You are fighting us all
And when we ask you why
You raise your sticks and cry and we fall
Oh, my friend
How did you come
To trade the fiddle for the drum

You say we have turned
Like the enemies you've earned
But we can remember
All the good things you are
And so we ask you please
Can we help you find the peace and the star
Oh my friend
We have all come
To fear the beating of your drum

"Both Sides Now"

Rows and floes of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say "I love you" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all

I've looked at life from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know life at all

"Morning Morgantown"

When morning comes to Morgantown
The merchants roll their awnings down
The milktrucks make their morning rounds
In morning Morgantown

We'll rise up early, with the sun
To ride the bus while everyone is yawning
And the day is young
In morning Morgantown

Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams a dollar down
Morning any town you name
Morning's just the same

We'll find a table in the shade
And sip our tea and lemonade
And watch the morning on parade
In morning Morgantown

Ladies in their rainbow fashions
Colored stop and go lights flashing
We'll wink at total strangers passing
In morning Morgantown

Morning Morgantown
Buy your dreams a dollar down
Morning any town you name
Morning's just the same

I'd like to buy you everything
A wooden bird with painted wings
A window full of colored rings
In morning Morgantown

But the only thing I have to give
To make you smile, to win you with
Are all the mornings still to live
In morning Morgantown

"For Free"

I slept last night in a good hotel
I went shopping today for jewels
The wind rushed around in the dirty town
And the children let out from the schools
I was standing on a noisy corner
Waiting for the walking green
Across the street he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet for free

Now me I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I got a black limousine and two gentlemen
Escorting me to the halls
And I play if you have the money
Or if you're a friend to me
But the one man band
By the quick lunch stand
He was playing real good for free

Nobody stopped to hear him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never been on their TV
So they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain
As the signal changed
He was playing real good for free

"Conversation"

He comes for conversation
I comfort him sometimes
Comfort and consultation
He knows that's what he'll find
I bring him apples and cheeses
He brings me songs to play
He sees me when he pleases
I see him in cafes
And I only say, hello
And turn away before his lady knows
How much I want to see him
She removes him, like a ring
To wash her hands
She only brings him out to show her friends
I want to free him

Secrets and sharing soda
That's how our time began
Love is a story told to a friend
It's second hand
But I'll listen to his questions
I'll give my answers when they're found
He says she keeps him guessing
But I know she keeps him down

She speaks in sorry sentences
Miraculous repentances
I don't believe her
Tomorrow he will come to me
And he'll speak his sorrow endlessly and he'll ask me why
Why can't I leave her

He comes for conversation
I comfort him sometimes
Comfort and consultation
He knows that's what he'll find
He knows that's what... he'll find

"Ladies Of The Canyon"

Trina wears her wampum beads
She fills her drawing book with lines
Sewing lace on widows' weeds
And filigree on leaf and vine
Vine and leaf are filigree
And her coat's a second-hand one
Trimmed with antique luxury
She is a lady of the canyon

Annie sits you down to eat
She always makes you welcome in
Cats and babies 'round her feet
And all are fat and none are thin
None are thin and all are fat
She may bake some brownies today
Saying, you are welcome back
She is another canyon lady

Estrella circus girl
Comes wrapped in songs and gypsy shawls
Songs like tiny hammers hurled
At beveled mirrors in empty halls
Empty halls and beveled mirrors
Sailing seas and climbing banyans
Come out for a visit here
To be a lady of the canyon

Trina takes her paints and her threads
And she weaves a pattern all her own
Annie bakes her cakes and her breads
And she gathers flowers for her home
For her home she gathers flowers
And Estrella, dear companion
Colors up the sunshine hours
Pouring music down the canyon
Coloring the sunshine hours
They are the ladies of the canyon

"Willy"

Willy is my child, he is my father
I would be his lady all my life
He says he'd love to live with me
But for an ancient injury
That has not healed
He said I feel once again
Like I gave my heart too soon
He stood looking through the lace
At the face on the conquered moon
And counting all the cars up the hill
And the stars on my window sill
There are still more reasons why
I love him

Willy is my joy, he is my sorrow
Now he wants to run away and hide
He says our love cannot be real
He cannot hear the chapel's pealing silver bells
But you know it's hard to tell
When you're in the spell if it's wrong or if it's real
But you're bound to lose
If you let the blues get you scared to feel
And I feel like I'm just being born
Like a shiny light breaking in a storm
There are so many reasons why I love him

Willy is my child, he is my father

"The Arrangement"

You could have been more
Than a name on the door
On the thirty-third floor in the air
More than a credit card
Swimming pool in the backyard

While you still have the time 
you could get away and find
A better life, you know the grind
Is so ungrateful
Racing cars, whiskey bars
No one cares who you really are

You're the keeper of the cards
Yes I know it gets hard
Keeping the wheels turning
And the wife she keeps the keys
She is so pleased to be
A part of the arrangement

You could have been more than a name on the door
On the thirty-third floor in the air
More than a consumer
Lying in some room trying to die
More than a credit card
Swimming pool in the backyard

You could have been more than a name on the door
You could have been more than a name on the door
You could have been more
You could have been more
You could have been more

"Rainy Night House"

It was a rainy night
We took a taxi to your mother's home
She went to Florida and left you
With your father's gun alone
Upon her small white bed
I fell into a dream
You sat up all the night and watched me
To see who in the world I might be

I am from the Sunday school
I sing soprano in the upstairs choir
You are a holy man
On the FM radio
I sat up all the night and watched thee
To see who in the world you might be

You called me beautiful
You called your mother - she was very tanned
So you packed your tent and you went
To live out in the Arizona sand
You are a refugee
From a wealthy family
You gave up all the golden factories
To see who in the world you might be

"The Priest"

The priest sat in the airport bar
He was wearing his father's tie
And his eyes looked into my eyes so far
Whenever the words ran dry
Behind the lash and the circles blue
He looked as only a priest can, thru
And his eyes said me and his eyes said you
And my eyes said, let us try

He said, "You wouldn't like it here
No it's no place you should share
The roof is ripped with hurricanes
And the room is always bare
I need the wind and I seek the cold"
He reached past the wine for my hand to hold
And he saw me young and he saw me old
And he saw me sitting there

Then he took his contradictions out
And he splashed them on my brow
So which words was I then to doubt
When choosing what to vow
Should I choose them all-should I make them mine
The sermons, the hymns and the valentines
And he asked for truth and he asked for time
And he asked for only now
Now the trials are trumpet scored
Oh will we pass the test
Or just as one loves more and more
Will one love less and less
Oh come let's run from this ring we're in
Where the Christians clap and the Germans grin
Saying let them lose, crying let them win
Oh make them both confess

"Blue Boy"

Lady called the blue boy, love,
She took him home
Made himself an idol, yes,
So he turned to stone
Like a pilgrim she travelled
To place her flowers
Before his granite grace
And she prayed aloud for love
To waken in his face
In his face, oh

Sometimes in the evening
He would read to her
Roll her in his arms
And give his seed to her
She would wake in the morning
Without him
And go to the window
And look out thru the pain
But the statue in her garden
He always looked the same
He looked the same, oh

Bring her boots of leather
And she will dance for him
Shyly from a feather fan
She'll glance for him
Here he comes after midnight
To find her again
He will come a few times more
Till he finds a lady statue
Standing in a door
In her door, oh

"Big Yellow Taxi"

They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique
And a swinging hot spot

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot

They took all the trees
Put 'em in a tree museum
Then they charged the people
A dollar and a half just to see 'em

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot

Hey, farmer, farmer
Put away that DDT now
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and the bees
Please

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot

Late last night I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi took away my old man

Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot

I said
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot

They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot

"Woodstock"

I came upon a child of God
He was walking along the road
And I asked him, where are you going
And this he told me...
I'm going on down to Yasgur's farm
I'm gonna join in a rock 'n' roll band
I'm gonna camp out on the land
I'm gonna try and get my soul free

We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

Then can I walk beside you
I have come here to lose the smog
And I feel to be a cog in something turning
Well maybe it is just the time of year
Or maybe it's the time of man
I don't know who I am
But you know life is for learning

We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere there was song and celebration
And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky
And they were turning into butterflies
Above our nation

We are stardust
Billion year old carbon
We are golden
Caught in the devil's bargain
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden

"The Circle Game"

Yesterday a child came out to wonder
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
And tearful at the falling of a star

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
Skated over ten clear frozen streams
Words like when you're older must appease him
And promises of someday make his dreams

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
Cartwheels turn to car wheels thru the town
And they tell him take your time it won't be long now
Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
There'll be new dreams maybe better dreams and plenty
Before the last revolving year is through

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

"All I Want"

I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
Traveling, traveling, traveling
Looking for something, what can it be
Oh I hate you some, I hate you some
I love you some
Oh I love you when I forget about me
I wanna be strong, I wanna laugh along
I wanna belong to the living
Alive, alive, I wanna get up and jive
Wanna wreck my stockings in some jukebox dive
Do you want- do you want-
Do you wanna dance with me baby
Do you wanna take a chance on
Maybe finding some sweet romance with me baby
Well come on

All I really, really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you too
All I really, really want our love to do
Is to bring out the best in me and in you
I wanna talk to you, I wanna shampoo you
I wanna renew you again and again
Applause, applause. Life is our cause
When I think of your kisses
My mind see-saws
Do you see- do you see-
Do you see how you hurt me baby
So I hurt you too
Then we both get so blue

I am on a lonely road and I am traveling
Looking for the key to set me free
Oh the jealousy, the greed is the unraveling
It's the unraveling
And it undoes all the joy that could be
I wanna have fun, I wanna shine like the sun
Wanna be the one that you wanna see
I wanna knit you a sweater
Wanna write you a love letter
Wanna make you feel better
I wanna make you feel free
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm,
Wanna make you feel free
I wanna make you feel free

"My Old Man"

My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man
Keeping away my blues

He's my sunshine in the morning
He's my fireworks at the end of the day
He's the warmest chord I ever heard
Play that warm chord, play and stay baby
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man
Keeping away my blues

But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide

Then he comes home
And he takes me in his loving arms
And he tells me all his troubles
And he tells me all my charms
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
No, my old man
Keeping away my blues

But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide

My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
No, my old man
Keeping away my lonesome blues

"Little Green"

Born with the moon in Cancer
Choose her a name she will answer to
Call her green and the winters cannot fade her
Call her green for the children who've made her
Little green, be a gypsy dancer

He went to California
Hearing that everything's warmer there
So you write him a letter and say, "Her eyes are blue"
He sends you a poem and she's lost to you
Little green, he's a non-conformer

Just a little green
Like the color when the spring is born
There'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
Just a little green
Like the nights when the Northern lights perform
There'll be icicles and birthday clothes
And sometimes there'll be sorrow

Child with a child pretending
Weary of lies you are sending home
So you sign all the papers in the family name
You're sad and you're sorry but you're not ashamed
Little green, have a happy ending

Just a little green
Like the color when the spring is born
There'll be crocuses to bring to school tomorrow
Just a little green
Like the nights when the Northern lights perform
There'll be icicles and birthday clothes
And sometimes there'll be sorrow

"Carey"

The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here Carey
But it's really not my home
My fingernails are filthy, I got beach tar on my feet
And I miss my clean white linen and my fancy French cologne

Oh Carey get out your cane
And I'll put on some silver
Oh you're a mean old Daddy, but I like you fine

Come on down to the Mermaid Caf and I will buy you a bottle of wine
And we'll laugh and toast to nothing and smash our empty glasses down
Let's have a round for these freaks and these soldiers
A round for these friends of mine
Let's have another round for the bright red devil
Who keeps me in this tourist town

Come on, Carey, get out your cane
I'll put on some silver
Oh you're a mean old Daddy, but I like you
I like you
I like you
I like you

Maybe I'll go to Amsterdam
Or maybe I'll go to Rome
And rent me a grand piano and put some flowers 'round my room
But let's not talk about fare-thee-wells now
The night is a starry dome.
And they're playin' that scratchy rock and roll
Beneath the Matala Moon

Come on, Carey, get out your cane
I'll put on some silver
You're a mean old Daddy, but I like you

The wind is in from Africa
Last night I couldn't sleep
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here
But, it's really not my home
Maybe it's been too long a time
Since I was scramblin' down in the street
Now they got me used to that clean white linen
And that fancy French cologne

Oh Carey, get out your cane
I'll put on my finest silver
We'll go to the Mermaid Caf
Have fun tonight
I said, oh, you're a mean old Daddy, but you're out of sight

"Blue"

Blue songs are like tattoos
You know I've been to sea before
Crown and anchor me
Or let me sail away

Hey Blue,
There is a song for you
Ink on a pin
Underneath the skin
An empty space to fill in

Well there's so many sinking now
You've got to keep thinking
You can make it through these waves
Acid, booze, and ass
Needles, guns, and grass
Lots of laughs, lots of laughs

Everybody's saying that hell's the hippest way to go
Well I don't think so
But I'm gonna take a look around it though
Blue, I love you

Blue, here is a shell for you
Inside you'll hear a sigh
A foggy lullaby
There is your song from me

"California"

Sitting in a park in Paris, France
Reading the news and it sure looks bad
They won't give peace a chance
That was just a dream some of us had
Still a lot of lands to see
But I wouldn't wanna stay here
It's too old and cold and settled in its ways here

Oh, but California
California I'm coming home
I'm gonna see the folks I dig
I'll even kiss a Sunset pig
California I'm coming home

I met a redneck on a Grecian isle
Who did the goat dance very well
He gave me back my smile
But he kept my camera to sell
Oh the rogue, the red red rogue
He cooked good omelettes and stews
And I might have stayed on with him there

But my heart cried out for you, California
Oh California I'm coming home
Oh make me feel good rock 'n' roll band
I'm your biggest fan
California, I'm coming home

Oh it gets so lonely
When you're walking
And the streets are full of strangers
All the news of home you read
Just give you the blues
Just give you the blues

So I bought me a ticket
I caught a plane to Spain
Went to a party down a red dirt road
There were lots of pretty people there
Reading Rolling Stone, reading Vogue
They said, "How long can you hang around"
I said a week, maybe two
Just until my skin turns brown

Then I'm going home to California
California I'm coming home
Oh will you take me as I am
Strung out on another man
California, I'm coming home

Oh it gets so lonely
When you're walking
And the streets are full of strangers
All the news of home you read
More about the war
And the bloody changes
Oh will you take me as I am
Will you take me as I am
Will you
Will you take me as I am
Hmmm mmmmm
Take me as I am

"This Flight Tonight"

Look out the left, the captain said
The lights down there that's where we'll land
I saw a falling star burn up
Above the Las Vegas sands
It wasn't the one that you gave to me
That night down south between the trailers
Not the early one
That you can wish upon
Not the northern one
That guides in the sailors

Oh star bright star bright
You've got the lovin' that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight

You got the touch so gentle and sweet
But you've got that look so critical
Now I can't talk to you baby
I get so weak
Sometimes I think love is just mythical
Up there's a heaven
Down there's a town
Blackness everywhere and little lights shine
Oh blackness blackness dragging me down
Come on light the candle in this poor heart of mine

Oh star bright star bright
You've got the lovin' that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight

I'm drinking sweet champagne
Got the headphones up high
Can't numb you out
Can't drum you out of my mind
They're playing Goodbye Baby
Baby Goodbye
Ooh ooh love is blind

Up go the flaps down go the wheels
I hope you got your heat turned on baby
I hope they finally fixed your automobile
I hope it's better when we meet again baby

Star bright star bright
You got the lovin' that I like all right
Turn this crazy bird around
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight

"River"

It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
And singing songs of joy and peace
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on

But it don't snow here
It stays pretty green
I'm going to make a lot of money
Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Whoa I wish I had a river I could skate away on
I made my baby cry

He tried hard to help me
You know, he put me at ease
And he loved me so naughty
Made me weak in the knees
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I'm so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I've gone and lost the best baby
That I ever had
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I wish I had a river so long
I would teach my feet to fly
Oh I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye

It's coming on Christmas
They're cutting down trees
They're putting up reindeer
Singing songs of joy and peace
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

"A Case Of You"

Just before our love got lost you said
"I am as constant as a northern star"
And I said, "Constantly in the darkness
Where's that at
If you want me I'll be in the bar"

On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh, Canada
With your face sketched on it twice

Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
And I would still be on my feet
Oh, I would still be on my feet

Oh, I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid

I remember that time you told me
You said, "Love is touching souls"
Surely you touched mine
'Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time

Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine
You taste so bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you, darling
And still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds
And she said, "Go to him, stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed"

Oh, but you are in my blood
You're my holy wine
You're so bitter
Bitter and so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I would still be on my feet

"The Last Time I Saw Richard"

The last time I saw Richard was Detroit in '68
And he told me all romantics meet the same fate someday
Cynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark caf
"You laugh," he said, "You think you're immune
Go look at your eyes, they're full of moon
You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you
All those pretty lies, pretty lies
When you gonna realize they're only pretty lies
Only pretty lies, just pretty lies"

He put a quarter in the Wurlitzer
And he pushed three buttons and the thing began to whirr
And a bar maid came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie
And she said, "Drink up now it's gettin' on time to close"
"Richard you haven't really changed," I said
"It's just that now you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head
You got tombs in your eyes, but the songs you punched are dreaming
Listen, they sing of love so sweet, love so sweet
When you gonna get yourself back on your feet
Oh love can be so sweet, love so sweet."

Richard got married to a figure skater
And he bought her a dishwasher and a coffee percolator
And he drinks at home now most nights with the TV on
And all the house lights left up bright
I'm gonna blow this damn candle out
I don't want nobody comin' over to my table
I got nothing to talk to anybody about
All good dreamers pass this way some day
Hidin' behind bottles in dark cafs, dark cafs
Only a dark cocoon before I get my gorgeous wings and fly away
Only a phase, these dark caf days

"Banquet"

Come to the dinner gong
The table is laden high
Fat bellies and hungry little ones
Tuck your napkins in
And take your share
Some get the gravy
And some get the gristle
Some get the marrow bone
And some get nothing
Though there's plenty to spare

I took my share down by the sea
Paper plates and Javex bottles on the tide
Seagulls come down
And they squawk at me
Down where the water-skiers glide

Some turn to Jesus
And some turn to heroin
Some turn to rambling round
Looking for a clean sky
And a drinking stream
Some watch the paint peel off
Some watch their kids grow up
Some watch their stocks and bonds
Waiting for that big deal
American Dream

I took my dream down by the sea
Yankee yachts and lobster pots and sunshine
And logs and sails
And Shell Oil pails
Dogs and tugs and summertime
Back in the banquet line
Angry young people crying

Who let the greedy in
And who left the needy out
Who made this salty soup
Tell him we're very hungry now
For a sweeter fare
In the cookie I read
"Some get the gravy
And some get the gristle
Some get the marrow bone
And some get nothing
Though there's plenty to spare"

"Cold Blue Steel And Sweet Fire"

Cold Blue Steel out of money
One eye for the beat police
Sweet Fire calling
"You can't deny me
Now you know what you need"
Underneath the jungle gym
Hollow-grey fire-escape thief
Looking for Sweet Fire
Shadow of Lady Release

"Come with me
I know the way" she says
"It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first
Leave someone a letter
You can come now
Or you can come later"

A wristwatch, a ring, a downstairs screamer
Edgy - black cracks of the sky
"Pin-cushion prick
Fix this poor bad dreamer"
"Money" cold shadows reply
Pawnshops crisscrossed and padlocked
Corridors spit on prayers and pleas
Sparks fly up from Sweet Fire
Black soot of Lady Release

"Come with me
I know the way" she says
"It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first
Does it really matter
If you come now
Or if you come on later"

Red water in the bathroom sink
Fever and the scum brown bowl
Blue Steel still begging
But it's indistinct
Someone's HI-Fi drumming Jelly Roll
Concrete concentration camp
Bashing in veins for peace
Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire
Fall into Lady Release

"Come with me
I know the way" she says
"It's down, down, down the dark ladder
Do you want to contact somebody first
I mean what does it really matter
You're going to come now
Or you're going to come later"

"Barangrill"

Three waitresses all wearing
Black diamond earrings
Talking about zombies
And Singapore slings
No trouble in their faces
Not one anxious voice
None of the crazy you get
From too much choice
The thumb and the satchel
Or the rented Rolls-Royce
And you think she knows something
By the second refill
You think she's enlightened
As she totals your bill
You say "Show me the way
To Barangrill"

Well some say it's in service
They say "Humble Makes Pure"
You're hoping it's near Folly
'Cause you're headed that way for sure
And you just have to laugh
'Cause it's all so crazy
Ah, her mind's on her boyfriend
And eggs over easy
It's just a trick on you
Her mirrors and your will
So you ask the truck driver
On the way to the till
But he's just a slave
To Barangrill

The guy at the gas pumps
He's got a lot of soul
He sings Merry Christmas for you
Just like Nat King Cole
And he makes up his own tune
Right on the spot
About whitewalls and windshields
And this job he's got
And you want to get moving
And you want to stay still
But lost in the moment
Some longing gets filled
And you even forget to ask
"Hey, Where's Barangrill"

"Lesson In Survival"

Lesson in survival
Spinning out on turns
That gets you tough
Guru books, the Bible
Only a reminder
That you're just not good enough
You need to believe in something
Once I could in our love

Black road
Double yellow line
Friends and kin
Campers in the kitchen
That's fine sometimes
But I know my needs
My sweet tumbleweed
I need more quiet times
By a river flowing
You and me
Deep kisses
And the sun going down

Maybe it's paranoia
Maybe it's sensitivity
Your friends protect you
Scrutinize me
I get so damn timid
Not at all the spirit
That's inside of me
Oh baby I can't seem to make it
With you socially
There's this reef around me

I'm looking way out at the ocean
Love to see that green water in motion
I'm gonna get a boat
And we can row it
If you ever get the notion
To be needed by me
Fresh salmon frying
And the tide rolling in

I went to see a friend tonight
Was very late when I walked in
My talking as it rambled
Revealed suspicious reasoning
The visit seemed to darken him
I came in as bright
As a neon light
And I burned out
Right there before him

I told him these things
I'm telling you now
Watched them buckle up
In his brow

When you dig down deep
You lose good sleep
And it makes you
Heavy company
I will always love you
Hands alike
Magnet and iron
The souls

"Let The Wind Carry Me"

Papa's faith is people
Mama she believes in cleaning
Papa's faith is in people
Mama she's always cleaning
Papa brought home the sugar
Mama taught me the deeper meaning

She don't like my kick pleat skirt
She don't like my eyelids painted green
She don't like me staying up late
In my high-heeled shoes
Living for that rock 'n' roll dancing scene
Papa says "Leave the girl alone, mother
She's looking like a movie queen"

Mama thinks she spoilt me
Papa knows somehow he set me free
Mama thinks she spoilt me rotten
She blames herself
But papa he blesses me
It's a rough road to travel
Mama let go now
It's always called for me

Sometimes I get that feeling
And I want to settle
And raise a child up with somebody
I get that strong longing
And I want to settle
And raise a child up with somebody
But it passes like the summer
I'm a wild seed again
Let the wind carry me

"For The Roses"

I heard it in the wind last night 
It sounded like applause 
Did you get a round resounding for you 
Way up here 
It seems like many dim years ago 
Since I heard that face to face 
Or seen you face to face 
Though tonight I can feel you here 
I get these notes 
On butterflies and lilac sprays 
From girls who just have to tell me 
They saw you somewhere

In some office sits a poet 
And he trembles as he sings 
And he asks some guy 
To circulate his soul around 
On your mark red ribbon runner 
The caressing rev of motors 
Finely tuned like fancy women 
In thirties evening gowns 
Up the charts 
Off to the airport 
Your name's in the news 
Everything's first class 
The lights go down 
And it's just you up there 
Getting them to feel like that

Remember the days when you used to sit 
And make up your tunes for love 
And pour your simple sorrow 
To the soundhole and your knee 
And now you're seen 
On giant screens 
And at parties for the press 
And for people who have slices of you 
From the company 
They toss around your latest golden egg 
Speculation well who's to know 
If the next one in the nest 
Will glitter for them so

I guess I seem ungrateful 
With my teeth sunk in the hand 
That brings me things
I really can't give up just yet
Now I sit up here the critic
And they introduce some band 
But they seem so much confetti 
Looking at them on my TV set 
Oh the power and the glory 
Just when you're getting a taste for worship
They start bringing out the hammers 
And the boards
And the nails

I heard it in the wind last night 
It sounded like applause 
Chilly now 
End of summer 
No more shiny hot nights 
It was just the arbutus rustling 
And the bumping of the logs 
And the moon swept down black water 
Like an empty spotlight

"See You Sometime"

Where are you now
Are you in some hotel room
Does it have a view 
Are you caught in a crowd
Or holding some honey
Who came on to you 
Why do you have to be so jive
OK hang up the phone
It hurts
But something survives
Though it's undermined
I'd still like to see you sometime

I'm feeling so good
And my friends all tell me
That I'm looking fine
I run in the woods
I spring from the boulders
Like a mama lion
I'm not ready to
Change my name again
But you know I'm not after
A piece of your fortune
And your fame
'Cause I tasted mine
I'd just like to see you sometime

Pack your suspenders
I'll come meet your plane
No need to surrender
I just want to see you again

We're in for more rain
I could sure use some sunshine on my apple trees
It seems such a shame
We start out so kind and end so heartlessly
I couldn't take them all on then
With a headful of questions and hypes
So when the hopes got so slim
I just resigned
But I'd still like to see you sometime
I'd sure like to see you

"Electricity"

The Minus is loveless
He talks to the land
And the leaves fall
And the pond over-ices
She don't know the system, Plus
She don't understand
She's got all the wrong fuses and splices
She's not going to fix it up
Too easy

The masking tape tangles
It's sticky and black
And the copper
Proud headed Queen Lizzie
Conducts little charges
That don't get charged back
Well the technical manual's busy
She's not going to fix it up too easy
And she holds out her flashlight
And she shines it on me
She wants me to tell her
What the trouble might be
Well I'm learning
It's peaceful
With a good dog and some trees
Out of touch with the breakdown
Of this century
They're not going to fix it up
Too easy

We once loved-together
And we floodlit that time
Input-output-electricity
But the lines overloaded
And the sparks started flying
And the loose wires
Were lashing out at me
She's not going to fix that up
Too easy
But she holds out her candle
And she shines it in
And she begs him to show her
How to fix it again
While the song that he sang her
To soothe her to sleep
Runs all through her circuits
Like a heartbeat
She's not going to fix it up
Too easy

"You Turn Me On I'm A Radio"

If you're driving into town
With a dark cloud above you
Dial in the number
Who's bound to love you

Oh honey you turn me on
I'm a radio
I'm a country station
I'm a little bit corny
I'm a wildwood flower
Waving for you
Broadcasting tower
Waving for you

And I'm sending you out
This signal here
I hope you can pick it up
Loud and clear

I know you don't like weak women
You get bored so quick
And you don't like strong women
'Cause they're hip to your tricks

It's been dirty for dirty
Down the line
But you know I come when you whistle
When you're loving and kind

But if you've got too many doubts
If there's no good reception for me
Then tune me out, 'cause honey
Who needs the static

It hurts the head
And you wind up cracking
And the day goes dismal
From "Breakfast Barney"
To the sign-off prayer
What a sorry face you get to wear
I'm going to tell you again now
If you're still listening there

If you're driving into town
With a dark cloud above you
Dial in the number
Who's bound to love you

If you're lying on the beach
With the transistor going
Kick off the sandflies honey
The love's still flowing
If your head says forget it
But your heart's still smoking
Call me at the station
The lines are open

"Blonde In The Bleachers"

The blonde in the bleachers
She flips her hair for you
Above the loudspeakers
You start to fall

She follows you home
But you miss living alone
You can still hear sweet mysteries
Calling you

The bands and the roadies
Lovin' 'em and leavin' 'em
It's pleasure to try 'em
It's trouble to keep 'em

'Cause it seems like you've gotta give up
Such a piece of your soul
When you give up the chase
Feeling it hot and cold
You're in rock 'n' roll
It's the nature of the race
It's the unknown child
So sweet and wild
It's youth
It's too good to waste

She tapes her regrets
To the microphone stand
She says "You can't hold the hand
Of a rock 'n' roll man
Very long
Or count on your plans
With a rock 'n' roll man
Very long
Compete with the fans
For your rock 'n' roll man
For very long
The girls and the bands
And the rock 'n' roll man"

"Woman Of Heart And Mind"

I am a woman of heart and mind
With time on her hands
No child to raise
You come to me like a little boy
And I give you my scorn and my praise
You think I'm like your mother
Or another lover or your sister
Or the queen of your dreams
Or just another silly girl
When love makes a fool of me

After the rush when you come back down
You're always disappointed
Nothing seems to keep you high
Drive your bargains
Push your papers
Win your medals
Fuck your strangers
Don't it leave you on the empty side
I'm looking for affection and respect
A little passion
And you want stimulation-nothing more
That's what I think
But you know I'll try to be there for you
When your spirits start to sink

All this talk about holiness now
It must be the start of the latest style
Is it all books and words
Or do you really feel it
Do you really laugh
Do you really care
Do you really smile
When you smile
You criticize and you flatter
You imitate the best
And the rest you memorize
You know the times you impress me most
Are the times when you don't try
When you don't even try

"Judgement Of The Moon And Stars (Ludwig's Tune)"

No tongue in the bell
And the fishwives yell
But they might as well be mute
So you get to keep the pictures
That don't seem like much
Cold white keys under your fingers
Now you're thinking
"That's no substitute
It just don't do it
Like the song of a warm warm body
Loving your touch"

In the court they carve your legend
With an apple in its jaw
And the women that you wanted
They get their laughs
Long silk stockings
On the bedposts of refinement
You're too raw
They think you're too raw
It's the judgement of the moon and stars
Your solitary path
Draw yourself a bath
Think what you'd like to have
For supper
Or take a walk
A park
A bridge
A tree
A river
Revoked but not yet cancelled
The gift goes on
In silence
In a bell jar
Still a song

You've got to shake your fists at lightning now
You've got to roar like forest fire
You've got to spread your light like blazes
All across the sky
They're going to aim the hoses on you
Show 'em you won't expire
Not till you burn up every passion
Not even when you die
Come on now
You've got to try
If you're feeling contempt
Well then you tell it
If you're tired of the silent night
Jesus well then you yell it
Condemned to wires and hammers
Strike every chord that you feel
That broken trees
And elephant ivories conceal

"Court And Spark"

Love came to my door with a sleeping roll
And a madman's soul
He thought for sure I'd seen him
Dancing up a river in the dark
Looking for a woman to court and spark

He was playing on the sidewalk for passing change
When something strange happened
Glory train passed through him
So he buried the coins he made in People's Park
And went looking for a woman to court and spark

It seemed like he read my mind
He saw me mistrusting him and still acting kind
He saw how I worried sometimes
I worry sometimes

All the guilty people, he said, they've all seen the stain
On their daily bread
On their Christian names
I cleared myself, I sacrificed my blues
And you could complete me, I'd complete you

His eyes were the colour of the sand and the sea
And the more he talked to me, you know
The more he reached me
But I couldn't let go of L.A.
City of the fallen angels

"Help Me"

Help me
I think I'm falling
In love again
When I get that crazy feeling
I know I'm in trouble again
I'm in trouble
'Cause you're a rambler and a gambler
And a sweet talking ladies man
And you love your lovin'
But not like you love your freedom

Help me
I think I'm falling
In love too fast
It's got me hoping for the future
And worrying about the past
'Cause I've seen some hot, hot blazes
Come down to smoke and ash
We love our lovin'
But not like we love our freedom

Didn't it feel good
We were sitting there talking
Or lying there not talking
Didn't it feel good
You dance with the lady
With the hole in her stocking
Didn't it feel good
Didn't it feel good

Help me
I think I'm falling
In love with you
Are you going to let me go there by myself
That's such a lonely thing to do
Both of us flirting around
Flirting and flirting
Hurting too
We love our lovin'
But not like we love our freedom

"Free Man In Paris"

The way I see it, he said, you just can't win it
Everybody's in it for their own gain
You can't please 'em all
There's always somebody calling you down
I do my best and I do good business
There's a lot of people asking for my time
They're trying to get ahead
They're trying to be a good friend of mine

I was a free man in Paris
I felt unfettered and alive
There was nobody calling me up for favors
And no one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star-maker machinery 
Behind the popular song

I deal in dreamers and telephone screamers
Lately I wonder what I do it for
If I had my way
I'd just walk through those doors
And wander down the Champs-lyses 
Going caf to cabaret
Thinking how I'll feel when I find 
That very good friend of mine

I was a free man in Paris
I felt unfettered and alive
Nobody was calling me up for favors
No one's future to decide
You know I'd go back there tomorrow
But for the work I've taken on
Stoking the star-maker machinery
Behind the popular song

"People's Parties"

All the people at this party
They've got a lot of style
They've got stamps of many countries
They've got passport smiles
Some are friendly
Some are cutting
Some are watching it from the wings
Some are standing in the centre
Giving to get something

Photo beauty gets attention
Then her eye paint's running down
She's got a rose in her teeth
And a lampshade crown
One minute she's so happy
Then she's crying on someone's knee
Saying laughing and crying
You know it's the same release

I told you when I met you
I was crazy
Cry for us all, beauty
Cry for Eddie in the corner
Thinking he's nobody
And Jack behind his joker
And stone-cold Grace behind her fan
And me in my frightened silence
Thinking I don't understand

I feel like I'm sleeping
Can you wake me
You seem to have a broader sensibility
I'm just living on nerves and feelings
With a weak and a lazy mind
And coming to peoples parties
Fumbling deaf dumb and blind

I wish I had more sense of humour
Keeping the sadness at bay
Throwing the lightness on these things

Laughing it all away
Laughing it all away
Laughing it all away
Laughing it all away

"Same Situation"

Again and again the same situation
For so many years
Tethered to a ringing telephone
In a room full of mirrors
A pretty girl in your bathroom
Checking out her sex appeal
I asked myself when you said you loved me
Do you think this can be real

Still I sent up my prayer
Wondering where it had to go
With heaven full of astronauts
And the Lord on death row
While the millions of his lost and lonely ones
Call out and clamour to be found
Caught in their struggle for higher positions
And their search for love that sticks around

You've had lots of lovely women
Now you turn your gaze to me
Weighing the beauty and the imperfection
To see if I'm worthy
Like the church
Like a cop
Like a mother
You want me to be truthful
Sometimes you turn it on me like a weapon though
And I need your approval

Still I sent up my prayer
Wondering who was there to hear
I said send me somebody
Who's strong and somewhat sincere
With the millions of the lost and lonely ones
I called out to be released
Caught in my struggle for higher achievements
And my search for love
That don't seem to cease

"Car On A Hill"

I've been sitting up waiting for my sugar to show
I've been listening to the sirens and the radio
(Listening to the sirens and the radio)
He said he'd be over three hours ago
I've been waitin' for his car on the hill
(Waitin' for his car on the hill)

He makes friends easy
He's not like me
I watch for judgment anxiously
Now where in the city can that boy be
Waitin' for a car
Climbin', climbin'
Climbin' the hill

He's a real good talker
I think he's a friend
Fast tires come screaming around the bend
(Fast tires come screaming around the bend)
But there's still no buzzer
They roll on
And I'm waitin' for his car on the hill
(Waitin' for a car on the hill)

It always seems so righteous at the start
When there's so much laughter
When there's so much spark
When there's so much sweetness in the dark
Waitin' for a car
Climbin', climbin'
Climbin' the hill

"Down To You"

Everything comes and goes
Marked by lovers and styles of clothes
Things that you held high
And told yourself were true
Lost or changing as the days come down to you
Down to you
Constant stranger
You're a kind person
You're a cold person too
It's down to you

You go down to the pick up station
Craving warmth and beauty
You settle for less than fascination
A few drinks later you're not so choosy
When the closing lights strip off the shadows
On this strange new flesh you've found
Clutching the night to you like a fig leaf
You hurry
To the blackness
And the blankets
To lay down an impression
And your loneliness

In the morning there are lovers in the street
They look so high
You brush against a stranger
And you both apologize
Old friends seem indifferent
You must have brought that on
Old bonds have broken down
Love is gone
Oooh love is gone
Written on your spirit this sad song
Love is gone

Everything comes and goes
Pleasure moves on too early
And trouble leaves too slow
Just when you're thinking
You've finally got it made
Bad news comes knocking
At your garden gate
Knocking for you
Constant stranger
You're a brute you're an angel
You can crawl you can fly too
It's down to you
It all comes down to you

"Just Like This Train"

I'm always running behind the time
Just like this train
Shaking into town
With the brakes complainin'

I used to count lovers like railroad cars
I counted them on my side
Lately I don't count on nothing
I just let things slide

The station master's shuffling cards
Boxcars are banging in the yards
Jealous loving'll make you crazy
If you can't find your goodness
'Cause you lost your heart

I went looking for a cause
Or a strong cat without claws
Or any reason to resume
And I found this empty seat
In this crowded waiting room
Everybody waiting

Old man sleeping on his bags
Women with that teased up kind of hair
Kids with the jitters in their legs
And those wide wide open stares
And the kids got cokes and chocolate bars
There's a thin man smoking a fat cigar
Jealous loving'll make you crazy
If you can't find your goodness
'Cause you've lost your heart

What are you going to do now
You've got no one to give your love to

Well I've got this berth and this roll down blind
I've got this fold up sink
And these rocks 
And these cactus going by
And a bottle of German wine to drink
Settle down into the clickety clack
With the clouds and the stars to read
Dreaming of the pleasure I'm gonna have
Watching your hairline recede, my vain darling

Watching your hair and clouds and stars
I'm rocking away in a sleeping car
This jealous loving's bound to make me crazy
I can't find my goodness
I lost my heart
Oh sour grapes
Because I lost my heart

"Raised On Robbery"

He was sitting in the lounge of the Empire Hotel
He was drinking for diversion, he was thinking for himself
A little money riding on the Maple Leafs
Along comes a lady in lacy sleeves
She says, let me sit down, you know drinking alone's a shame, it's a shame, it's a crying shame
Look at those jokers glued to that damn hockey game
Hey honey, you've got lots of cash
Bring us down a bottle and we'll have some laughs
Gin's what I'm drinking, I was raised on robbery

I'm a pretty good cook, sitting on my groceries
Come up to my kitchen, I'll show you my best recipe
I try and I try but I can't save a cent
I'm up after midnight cooking, trying to make my rent
I'm rough but I'm pleasing, I was raised on robbery

We had a little money once, they were pushing through a four-lane highway
Government gave us three thousand dollars, you should have seen it fly away
First he bought a '57 Biscayne, he put it in the ditch
He drunk up all the rest, that son of a bitch
His blood's bad whiskey, I was raised on robbery

You know you ain't bad looking, I like the way you hold your drinks
Come home with me honey, I ain't asking for no full-length mink
Hey, where you going, don't go yet
Your glass ain't empty and we just met
You're mean when you're loaded, I was raised on robbery

"Trouble Child"

Up in a sterilized room
Where they let you be lazy
Knowing your attitude's all wrong
And you got to change
And that's not easy
Dragon shining with all values known
Dazzling you-keeping you from your own
Where is the lion in you to defy him
When you're this weak
And this spacey...

So what are you going to do about it
You can't live life and you can't leave it
Advice and religion-you can't take it
You can't seem to believe it
The peacock is afraid to parade
You're under the thumb of the maid
You really can't give love in this condition
Still you know how you need it

They open and close you
Then they talk like they know you
They don't know you
They're friends and they're foes too
Trouble child
Breaking like the waves at Malibu

So why does it come as such a shock
To know you really have no one
Only a river of changing faces
Looking for an ocean
They trickle through your leaky plans
Another dream over the dam
And you're lying in some room
Feeling like your right to be human
Is going over too
Well some are going to knock you
And some'll try to clock you
You know it's really hard
To talk sense to you
Trouble child
Breaking like the waves at Malibu

"Twisted"

My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head
The way he described it
He said I'd be better dead than live
I didn't listen to his jive
I knew all along
That he was all wrong
And I knew that he thought
I was crazy but I'm not
Oh no

My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head
He said I'd need treatment
But I'm not that easily led
He said I was the type
That was most inclined
When out of his sight
To be out of my mind
And he thought I was nuts
No more ifs or ands or buts

They say as a child
I appeared a little bit wild
With all my crazy ideas
But I knew what was happening
I knew I was a genius
What's so strange when you know
That you're a wizard at three
I knew that this was meant to be

Now I heard little children
Were supposed to sleep tight
That's why I got into the vodka one night
My parents got frantic
Didn't know what to do
But I saw some crazy scenes
Before I came to
Now do you think I was crazy
I may have been only three
But I was swinging

They all laugh at angry young men
They all laugh at Edison
And also at Einstein
So why should I feel sorry
If they just couldn't understand
The idiomatic logic
That went on in my head
I had a brain
It was insane
Oh they used to laugh at me
When I refused to ride
On all those double-decker buses
All because there was no driver on the top

(What No driver on the top)
(Man, the chick is twisted. Crazy ... should be. Here ... flip city.)

My analyst told me
That I was right out of my head
But I said dear doctor
I think that it's you instead
Because I have got a thing
That's unique and new
To prove it I'll have
The last laugh on you
'Cause instead of one head
I got two
And you know two heads are better than one

"In France They Kiss On Main Street"

Downtown
My darling dime store thief
In the War of Independence
Rock 'n' roll rang sweet as victory
Under neon signs
A girl was in bloom
And a woman was fading 
In a suburban room
I said take me to the dance
Do you want to dance
I love to dance
And I told him 
They don't take chances
They seem so removed from romance
They've been broken in churches and schools
And molded to middle class circumstance
And we were rollin'
Rollin'
Rock 'n' rollin'

Downtown
The dance halls and cafes
Feel so wild you could break somebody's heart
Just doing the latest dance craze
Gail and Louise
In those push up brassieres
Tight dresses and rhinestone rings
Drinking up the band's beers
Young love was kissing under bridges
Kissing in cars 
Kissing in cafes
And we were walking down Main Street
Kisses like bright flags hung on holidays
In France they kiss on Main Street
Amour, mama, not cheap display
And we were rollin'
Rollin'
Rock 'n' rollin'

Downtown
In the pinball arcade
With his head full of pool hall pitches
And songs from the hit parade
He'd be singing "Bye, Bye, Love"
While he's racking up his free play
Let those rock 'n' roll choir boys
Come and carry us away
Sometimes Chickie had the car
Or Ron had a car
Or Lead Foot Melvin with his hotwire head
We'd all go looking for a party
Looking to raise Jesus up from the dead
And I'd be kissing in the back seat
Thrilling to the Brando-like things that he said
And we'd be rollin'
Rollin'
Rock 'n' rolling

Rollin'
Rollin'
Rock 'n' rollin'

Rollin'
Rollin'
Rock 'n' rollin'

"The Jungle Line"

Rousseau walks on trumpet paths
Safaris to the heart of all that jazz
Through I-bars and girders, through wires and pipes
The mathematic circuits of the modern nights
Through huts, through Harlem, through jails and gospel pews
Through the class on Park and the trash on Vine
Through Europe and the deep deep heart of Dixie blue
Through savage progress cuts the jungle line

In a low-cut blouse she brings the beer
Rousseau paints a jungle flower behind her ear
Those cannibals-of shuck and jive
They'll eat a working girl like her alive
With his hard-edged eye and his steady hand
He paints the cellar full of ferns and orchid vines
And he hangs a moon above a five-piece band
He hangs it up above the jungle line

The jungle line, the jungle line
Screaming in a ritual of sound and time
Floating, drifting on the air-conditioned wind
And drooling for a taste of something smuggled in
Pretty women funneled through valves and smoke
Coy and bitchy, wild and fine
And charging elephants and chanting slaving boats
Charging, chanting down the jungle line

There's a poppy wreath on a soldier's tomb
There's a poppy snake in a dressing room
Poppy poison-poppy tourniquet
It slithers away on brass like mouthpiece spit
And metal skin and ivory birds
Go steaming up to Rousseau's vines
They go steaming up to Brooklyn Bridge
Steaming, steaming, steaming up the jungle line

"Edith And The Kingpin"

The big man arrives
Disco dancers greet him
Plainclothes cops greet him
Small town, big man, fresh lipstick glistening
Sophomore jive
From victims of typewriters
The band sounds like typewriters
The big man he's not listening
His eyes hold Edith
His left hand holds his right
What does that hand desire
That he grips it so tight

Edith in the ring
The passed-over girls are conferring
The man with the diamond ring is purring
All claws for now withdrawn
One by one they bring
His renegade stories to her
His crimes and his glories to her
In challenge they look on
Women he has taken grow old too soon
He tilts their tired faces
Gently to the spoon

Edith in his bed
A plane in the rain is humming
The wires in the walls are humming
Some song some mysterious song
Bars in her head
Beating frantic and snowblind
Romantic and snowblind
She says his crime belongs
Edith and the Kingpin
Each with charm to sway
Are staring eye to eye
They dare not look away
You know they dare not look away

"Don't Interrupt The Sorrow"

Don't interrupt the sorrow
Darn right
In flames our prophet witches
Be polite
A room full of glasses
He says "Your notches, liberation doll"
And he chains me with that serpent
To that Ethiopian wall

Anima rising
Queen of Queens
Wash my guilt of Eden
Wash and balance me
Anima rising
Uprising in me tonight
She's a vengeful little goddess
With an ancient crown to fight

Truth goes up in vapors
The steeples lean
Winds of change patriarchs
Snug in your bible belt dreams
God goes up the chimney
Like childhood Santa Claus
The good slaves love the good book
A rebel loves a cause

I'm leaving on the 115
You're darn right
Since I was seventeen
I've had no one over me
He says "Anima rising
So what
Petrified wood process
Tall timber down to rock"

Don't interrupt the sorrow
Darn right
He says "We walked on the moon
You be polite"
Don't let up the sorrow
Death and birth and death and birth and death and birth
He says "Bring that bottle kindly
And I'll pad your purse
I've got a head full of quandary
And a mighty mighty mighty thirst"

Seventeen glasses
Rhine wine
Milk of the Madonna
Clandestine
He don't let up the sorrow
He lies and he cheats
It takes a heart like Mary's these days
When your man gets weak

"Shades Of Scarlett Conquering"

Out of the fire like Catholic saints
Comes Scarlett and her deep complaint
Mimicking tenderness she sees
In sentimental movies
A celluloid rider comes to town
Cinematic lovers sway
Plantations and sweeping ballroom gowns
Take her breath away

Out in the wind in crinolines
Chasing the ghosts of Gable and Flynn
Through stand-in boys and extra players
Magnolias hopeful in her auburn hair
She comes from a school of southern charm
She likes to have things her way
Any man in the world holding out his arm
Would soon be made to pay

Friends have told her "Not so proud"
Neighbors trying to sleep and yelling "Not so loud"

Lovers in anger "Block Of Ice"
Harder and harder just to be nice
Given in the night to dark dreams
From the dark things she feels
She covers her eyes in the x-rated scenes
Running from the reels

Beauty and madness to be praised
'Cause it is not easy to be brave
To walk around in so much need
To carry the weight of all that greed
Dressed in stolen clothes she stands
Cast iron and frail
With her impossibly gentle hands
And her blood-red fingernails

Out of the fire and still smoldering
She says "A woman must have everything"
Shades of Scarlett Conquering
She says "A woman must have everything"

"The Hissing Of Summer Lawns"

He bought her a diamond for her throat
He put her in a ranch house on a hill
She could see the valley barbecues
From her window sill
See the blue pools in the squinting sun
Hear the hissing of summer lawns

He put up a barbed wire fence
To keep out the unknown
And on every metal thorn
Just a little blood of his own
She patrols that fence of his
To a latin drum
And the hissing of summer lawns
Darkness
Wonder makes it easy
Darkness
With a joyful mask
Darkness
Tube's gone, darkness, darkness, darkness
No color no contrast

A diamond dog
Carrying a cup and a cane
Looking through a double glass
Looking at too much pride and too much shame
There's a black fly buzzing
There's a heat wave burning in her master's voice
Hissing summer lawns

He gave her his darkness to regret
And good reason to quit him
He gave her a roomful of Chippendale
That nobody sits in
Still she stays with a love of some kind
It's the lady's choice
The hissing of summer lawns

"The Boho Dance"

Down in the cellar in the Boho zone
I went looking for some sweet inspiration, oh well
Just another hard-time band
With Negro affectations
I was a hopeful in rooms like this
When I was working cheap
It's an old romance the Boho dance
It hasn't gone to sleep

But even on the scuffle
The cleaner's press was in my jeans
And any eye for detail
Caught a little lace along the seams

And you were in the parking lot
Subterranean by your own design
The virtue of your style inscribed
On your contempt for mine
Jesus was a beggar, he was rich in grace
And Solomon kept his head in all his glory
It's just that some steps outside the Boho dance
Have a fascination for me

A camera pans the cocktail hour
Behind a blind of potted palms
And finds a lady in a Paris dress
With runs in her nylons

You read those books where luxury
Comes as a guest to take a slave
Books where artists in noble poverty
Go like virgins to the grave
Don't you get sensitive on me
'Cause I know you're just too proud
You couldn't step outside the Boho dance now
Even if good fortune allowed

Like a priest with a pornographic watch
Looking and longing on the sly
Sure it's stricken from your uniform
But you can't get it out of your eyes

Nothing is capsulized in me
On either side of town
The streets were never really mine
Not mine these glamour gowns

"Harry's House-Centerpiece"

Heatwaves on the runway
As the wheels set down
He takes his baggage off the carousel
He takes a taxi into town
Yellow schools of taxi fishes
Jonah in a ticking whale
Caught up at the light in the fishnet windows of Bloomingdale's
Watching those high fashion girls
Skinny black models with raven curls
Beauty parlor blondes with credit card eyes
Looking for the chic and the fancy to buy

He opens up his suitcase
In the continental suite
And people thirty stories down
Look like colored currents in the street
A helicopter lands on the Pan Am roof
Like a dragonfly on a tomb
And business men in button downs
Press into conference rooms
Battalions of paper-minded males
Talking commodities and sales
While at home their paper wives
And paper kids
Paper the walls to keep their gut reactions hid

Yellow checkers for the kitchen
Climbing ivy for the bath
She is lost in House and Gardens
He's caught up in Chief of Staff
He drifts off into the memory
Of the way she looked in school
With her body oiled and shining
At the public swimming pool ...

The more I'm with you, pretty baby
The more I feel my love increase
I'm building all my dreams around you
Our happiness will never cease
'Cause nothing's any good without you
Baby you're my centerpiece

We'll find a house and garden somewhere
Along a country road a piece
A little cottage on the outskirts
Where we can really find release
'Cause nothing's any good without you
Baby you're my centerpiece

(When we be home Harry)
(Get down of the boat)
((Well, I'm sure sick of that so far))
(When we be home Harry)
(I said get down off of there)
((Nothing's any good))
(When we be home Harry)
(Nothing's any good)

Shining hair and shining skin
Shining as she reeled him in
To tell him like she did today
Just what he could do with Harry's House
And Harry's take home pay

"Sweet Bird"

Out on some borderline
Some mark of in-between
I lay down golden in time
And woke up vanishing

Sweet bird you are
Briefer than a falling star
All these vain promises on beauty jars
Somewhere with your wings on time
You must be laughing
Behind our eyes
Calendars of our lives
Circled with compromise
Sweet bird of time and change
You must be laughing
Up on your feathers laughing

Golden in time
Cities under the sand
Power ideals and beauty
Fading in everyone's hand

Give me some time
I feel like I'm losing mine
Out here on this horizon line
With the earth spinning
And the sky forever rushing
No one knows
They can never get that close
Guesses at most
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching

"Shadows And Light"

Every picture has its shadows
And it has some source of light
Blindness, blindness and sight
The perils of benefactors
The blessings of parasites
Blindness, blindness and sight
Threatened by all things
Devil of cruelty
Drawn to all things
Devil of delight
Mythical devil of the ever-present laws
Governing blindness, blindness and sight

Suntans in reservation dining rooms
Pale miners in their lantern rays
Night, night and day
Hostage smile on presidents
Freedom scribbled in the subway
It's like night, night and day
Threatened by all things
God of cruelty
Drawn to all things
God of delight
Mythical god of the everlasting laws
Governing day, day and night

Critics of all expression
Judges in black and white
Saying it's wrong, saying it's right
Compelled by prescribed standards
Or some ideals we fight
For wrong, wrong and right
Threatened by all things
Man of cruelty-mark of Cain
Drawn to all things
Man of delight-born again, born again
Man of the laws, the ever-broken laws
Governing wrong, wrong and right
Governing wrong, wrong and right
Wrong and right

"Coyote"

No regrets Coyote
We just come from such different sets of circumstance
I'm up all night in the studios
And you're up early on your ranch
You'll be brushing out a brood mare's tail
While the sun is ascending
And I'll just be getting home with my reel to reel
There's no comprehending
Just how close to the bone and the skin and the eyes
And the lips you can get
And still feel so alone
And still feel related
Like stations in some relay
You're not a hit and run driver
No no
Racing away

You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

We saw a farmhouse burning down
In the middle of nowhere
In the middle of the night
And we rolled right past that tragedy
Till we turned into some road house lights
Where a local band was playing
Locals were up kicking and shaking on the floor
And the next thing I know
That coyote's at my door
He pins me in a corner and he won't take no
He drags me out on the dance floor
And we're dancing close and slow
Now he's got a woman at home
He's got another woman down the hall
He seems to want me anyway
Why'd you have to get so drunk
And lead me on that way

You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

I looked a coyote right in the face
On the road to Baljennie near my old home town
He went running through the whisker wheat
Chasing some prize down
And a hawk was playing with him
Coyote was jumping straight up and making passes
He had those same eyes just like yours
Under your dark glasses
Privately probing the public rooms
And peeking through keyholes in numbered doors
Where the players lick their wounds
And take their temporary lovers
And their pills and powders to get them through this passion play
No regrets Coyote
I'll just get off up aways

You just picked up a hitcher
A prisoner of the white lines on the freeway

Coyote's in the coffee shop
He's staring a hole in his scrambled eggs
He picks up my scent on his fingers
While he's watching the waitresses' legs
He's too far from the Bay of Fundy
From appaloosas and eagles and tides
And the air conditioned cubicles
And the carbon ribbon rides
Are spelling it out so clear
Either he's going to have to stand and fight
Or take off out of here
I tried to run away myself
To run away and wrestle with my ego
And with this flame
You put here in this Eskimo
In this hitcher
In this prisoner
Of the fine white lines
Of the white lines on the free free way

"Amelia"

I was driving across the burning desert
When I spotted six jet planes
Leaving six white vapor trails across the bleak terrain
It was the hexagram of the heavens
It was the strings of my guitar
Amelia it was just a false alarm

The drone of flying engines
Is a song so wild and blue
It scrambles time and seasons if it gets through to you
Then your life becomes a travelogue
Of picture post card charms
Oh Amelia it was just a false alarm

People'll tell you where they've gone
They'll tell you where to go
But till you get there yourself you never really know
Where some have found their paradise
Others just come to harm
Oh Amelia it was just a false alarm

I wish that he was here tonight
It's so hard to obey
His sad request of me to kindly stay away
So this is how I hide the hurt
As the road leads cursed and charmed
I tell Amelia it was just a false alarm

A ghost of aviation
She was swallowed by the sky
Or by the sea like me she had a dream to fly
Like Icarus ascending
On beautiful foolish arms
Amelia it was just a false alarm

Maybe I've never really loved
I guess that is the truth
I've spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitudes
And looking down on everything
I crashed into his arms
Amelia it was just a false alarm

I pulled into the Cactus Tree Motel
To shower off the dust
And I slept on the strange pillows of my wanderlust
I dreamed of 747s
Over geometric farms
Dreams Amelia
Dreams and false alarms

"Furry Sings The Blues"

Old Beale Street is coming down
Sweeties' Snack Bar boarded up now
And Egles The Tailor and the Shine Boy's gone
Faded out with ragtime blues
Handy's cast in bronze
And he's standing in a little park
With a trumpet in his hand
Like he's listening back to the good old bands
And the click of high heeled shoes
Old Furry sings the blues
Propped up in his bed
With his dentures and his leg removed
And Ginny's there
For her kindness and Furry's beer
She's the old man's angel overseer

Pawn shops glitter like gold tooth caps
In the grey decay
They chew the last few dollars off
Old Beale Street's carcass
Carrion and mercy
Blue and silver sparkling drums
Cheap guitars, eye shades and guns
Aimed at the hot blood of being no one
Down and out in Memphis Tennessee
Old Furry sings the blues
You bring him smoke and drink and he'll play for you
It's mostly muttering now and sideshow spiel
But there was one song he played
I could really feel

(But he's got nobody
Old Furry's got nobody)

There's a double bill murder at the New Daisy
The old girl's silent across the street
She's silent  waiting for the wrecker's beat
Silent  staring at her stolen name
Diamond boys and satin dolls
Bourbon laughter- ghosts  history falls
To parking lots and shopping malls
As they tear down old Beale Street
Old Furry sings the blues
He points a bony finger at you and says
"I don't like you"
Everybody laughs as if it's the old man's standard joke
But it's true
We're only welcome for our drink and smoke

W.C. Handy I'm rich and I'm fey
And I'm not familiar with what you played
But I get such strong impressions of your hey day
Looking up and down old Beale Street
Ghosts of the darktown society
Come right out of the bricks at me
Like it's a Saturday night
They're in their finery
Dancing it up and making deals
Furry sings the blues
Why should I expect that old guy to give it to me true
Fallen to hard luck
And time and other thieves
While our limo is shining on his shanty street
Old Furry sings the blues

"A Strange Boy"

A strange boy is weaving
A course of grace and havoc
On a yellow skateboard
Thru midday sidewalk traffic
Just when I think he's foolish and childish
And I want him to be manly
I catch my fool and my child
Needing love and understanding

What a strange, strange boy
He still lives with his family
Even the war and the navy
couldn't bring him to maturity

He keeps referring back to school days
And clinging to his child
Fidgeting and bullied
His crazy wisdom holding onto something wild
He asked me to be patient
Well I failed
"Grow up" I cried
And as the smoke was clearing he said
"Give me one good reason why"

What a strange, strange boy
He sees the cars as sets of waves
Sequences of mass and space
He sees the damage in my face

We got high on travel
And we got drunk on alcohol
And on love the strongest poison and medicine of all
See how that feeling comes and goes
Like the pull of moon on tides
Now I am surf rising
Now parched ribs of sand at his side

What a strange, strange boy
I gave him clothes and jewelry
I gave him my warm body
I gave him power over me

A thousand glass eyes were staring
In a cellar full of antique dolls
I found an old piano
And sweet chords rose up in waxed New England halls
While the boarders were snoring
Under crisp white sheets of curfew
We were newly lovers then
We were fire in the stiff blue-haired house rules

"Hejira"

I'm travelling in some vehicle
I'm sitting in some cafe
A defector from the petty wars
That shell shock love away
There's comfort in melancholy
When there's no need to explain
It's just as natural as the weather
In this moody sky today
In our possessive coupling
So much could not be expressed
So now I'm returning to myself
These things that you and I suppressed
I see something of myself in everyone
Just at this moment of the world
As snow gathers like bolts of lace
Waltzing on a ballroom girl

You know it never has been easy
Whether you do or you do not resign
Whether you travel the breadth of extremities
Or stick to some straighter line
Now here's a man and a woman sitting on a rock
They're either going to thaw out or freeze
Listen...
Strains of Benny Goodman
Coming through the snow and the pinewood trees
I'm porous with travel fever
But you know I'm so glad to be on my own
Still somehow the slightest touch of a stranger
Can set up trembling in my bones
I know - no one's going to show me everything
We all come and go unknown
Each so deep and superficial
Between the forceps and the stone

Well I looked at the granite markers
Those tribute to finality - to eternity
And then I looked at myself here
Chicken scratching for my immortality
In the church they light the candles
And the wax rolls down like tears
There's the hope and the hopelessness
I've witnessed thirty years
We're only particles of change I know, I know
Orbiting around the sun
But how can I have that point of view
When I'm always bound and tied to someone
White flags of winter chimneys
Waving truce against the moon
In the mirrors of a modern bank
From the window of a hotel room

I'm travelling in some vehicle
I'm sitting in some cafe
A defector from the petty wars
Until love sucks me back that way

"Song For Sharon"

I went to Staten Island, Sharon
To buy myself a mandolin
And I saw the long white dress of love
On a storefront mannequin
Big boat chuggin' back with a belly full of cars
All for something lacy
Some girl's going to see that dress
And crave that day like crazy

Little Indian kids on a bridge up in Canada
They can balance and they can climb
Like their fathers before them
They'll walk the girders of the Manhattan skyline
Shine your light on me Miss Liberty
Because as soon as this ferry boat docks
I'm headed to the church
To play Bingo
Fleece me with the gamblers' flocks

I can keep my cool at poker
But I'm a fool when love's at stake
Because I can't conceal emotion
What I'm feeling's always written on my face
There's a gypsy down on Bleecker Street
I went in to see her as a kind of joke
And she lit a candle for my love luck
And eighteen bucks went up in smoke

Sharon, I left my man
At a North Dakota junction
And I came out to the "Big Apple" here
To face the dream's malfunction
Love's a repetitious danger
You'd think I'd be accustomed to
Well, I do accept the changes
At least better than I used to do

A woman I knew just drowned herself
The well was deep and muddy
She was just shaking off futility
Or punishing somebody
My friends were calling up all day yesterday
All emotions and abstractions
It seems we all live so close to that line
And so far from satisfaction

Dora says, "Have children"
Mama and Betsy say, "Find yourself a charity."
Help the needy and the crippled or put some time into ecology."
Well, there's a wide wide world of noble causes
And lovely landscapes to discover
But all I really wanna do right now
Is...find another lover

When we were kids in Maidstone, Sharon
I went to every wedding in that little town
To see the tears and the kisses
And the pretty lady in the white lace wedding gown
And walking home on the railroad tracks
Or swinging on the playground swing
Love stimulated my illusions
More than anything

And when I went skating after Golden Reggie
You know it was white lace I was chasing
Chasing dreams
Mama's nylons underneath my cowgirl jeans
He showed me first you get the kisses
And then you get the tears
But the ceremony of the bells and lace
Still veils this reckless fool here

Now there are twenty-nine skaters on Wollman Rink
Circling in singles and in pairs
In this vigorous anonymity
A blank face at the window stares and
stares and stares and stares and stares
And the power of reason
And the flowers of deep feelings
Seem to serve me
Only to deceive me

Sharon you've got a husband
And a family and a farm
I've got the apple of temptation
And a diamond snake around my arm
But you still have your music
And I've still got my eyes on the land and the sky
You sing for your friends and your family
I'll walk green pastures by and by

"Black Crow"

There's a crow flying
Black and ragged
Tree to tree
He's black as the highway that's leading me
Now he's diving down
To pick up on something shiny
I feel like that black crow
Flying
In a blue sky

I took the ferry to the highway
Then I drove to a pontoon plane
I took a plane to a taxi
And a taxi to a train
I've been traveling so long
How'm I ever gonna know my home
When I see it again
I'm like a black crow flying
In a blue blue sky

In search of love and music
My whole life has been
Illumination
Corruption
And diving diving diving diving
Diving down to pick up on every shiny thing
Just like that black crow flying
In a blue sky

I looked at the morning
After being up all night
I looked at my haggard face in the bathroom light
I looked out the window
And I I saw that ragged soul take flight
I saw a back crow flying
In a blue sky

Oh I'm like a black crow flying
In a blue sky

"Blue Motel Room"

I've got a blue motel room
With a blue bedspread
I've got the blues inside and outside my head
Will you still love me
When I call you up when I'm down
Here in Savannah it's pouring rain
Palm trees in the porch light like slick black cellophane
Will you still love me
When I call you up when I get back to town
I know that you've got all those pretty girls coming on
Hanging on your boom-boom-pachyderm
Will you tell those girls that you've got German Measles
Honey, tell them you've got germs
I hope you'll be thinking of me
Because I'll be thinking of you
While I'm traveling home alone
Tell those girls that you've got Joni
She's coming back home

I've got road maps
From two dozen states
I've got coast to coast just to contemplate
Will you still love me
When I get back to town
It's funny how these old feelings hang around
You think they're gone
No, no
They just go underground
Will you still love me
When I get back to L.A. town
You and me, we're like America and Russia
We're always keeping score
We're always balancing the power
And that can get to be a cold cold war
We're going to have to hold ourselves a peace talk
In some neutral caf
You lay down your sneaking round the town, honey
And I'll lay down the highway

I've got a blue motel room
With a blue bedspread
I've got the blues inside and outside my head
Will you still love me
When I get back to town

"Refuge Of The Roads"

I met a friend of spirit
He drank and womanized
And I sat before his sanity
I was holding back from crying
He saw my complications
And he mirrored me back simplified
And we laughed how our perfection
Would always be denied
"Heart and humor and humility"
He said "Will lighten up your heavy load"
I left him then for the refuge of the roads

I fell in with some drifters
Cast upon a beachtown
Winn Dixie cold cuts and highway hand me downs
And I wound up fixing dinner
For them and Boston Jim
I well up with affection
Thinking back down the roads to then
The nets were overflowing
In the Gulf of Mexico
They were overflowing in the refuge of the roads

There was spring along the ditches
There were good times in the cities
Oh, radiant happiness
It was all so light and easy
Till I started analyzing
And I brought on my old ways
A thunderhead of judgment was
Gathering in my gaze
And it made most people nervous
They just didn't want to know
What I was seeing in the refuge of the roads

I pulled off into a forest
Crickets clicking in the ferns
Like a wheel of fortune
I heard my fate turn, turn turn
And I went running down a white sand road
I was running like a white-assed deer
Running to lose the blues
To the innocence in here
These are the clouds of Michelangelo
Muscular with gods and sungold
Shine on your witness in the refuge of the roads

In a highway service station
Over the month of June
Was a photograph of the earth
Taken coming back from the moon
And you couldn't see a city
On that marbled bowling ball
Or a forest or a highway
Or me here least of all
You couldn't see these cold water restrooms
Or this baggage overload
Westbound and rolling taking refuge in the roads

"Overture - Cotton Avenue"

A red sun came rolling down a grey sky
And the frogs and dogs and night birds then
Started up singing sweet country lullaby

You see that patch of city lights
Somewhere in there's Cotton Avenue
That's where I'm going to take myself tonight
With a spit shine on my dancing shoes

If you got a place like that to go
You just have to go there
If you got no place special
Well then, you just go no place special

I guess it's just the summer in the young blood
Ripe and juicy in the young blood
Teasing to go down to Cotton Avenue
To hear the shiny shiny music
See all the shiny people dancing to it
Anytime you go to Cotton Avenue

If you got a place like that to go
You know you got to go there
If you got no place special
Well then, you just go no place special

You see that summer storm brewing in the southern sky
By the time it hits here I'll be dancing high and dry
To rhythm and blues on Cotton Avenue
Poor boys'll be hanging around outside in the street
They got all the latest words
They're dancing to the latest beat
While they're hustling and sizing you on Cotton Avenue

If you got a place like that to go
You just have to go there
If you've got no place special
Well my dear
You just go no place special

"Talk To Me"

There was a moon and a street lamp
I didn't know I drank such a lot
'Till I pissed a tequila-anaconda
The full length of the parking lot
Oh, I talk too loose
Again I talk too open and free
I pay a high price for my open talking
Like you do for your silent mystery

Come and talk to me
Please talk to me
Talk to me, talk to me
Mr. Mystery

We could talk about Martha
We could talk about landscapes
I'm not above gossip
But I'll sit on a secret where honor is at stake
Or we could talk about power
About Jesus and Hitler and Howard Hughes
Or Charlie Chaplin's movies
Or Bergman's Nordic blues
Please just talk to me
Any old theme you choose
Just come and talk to me
Mr. Mystery, talk to me

You could talk like a fool-I'd listen
You could talk like a sage
Anyway the best of my mind
All goes down on the strings and the page
That mind picks up all these pictures
It still gets my feet up to dance
Even though it's covered with keloids
From the "slings and arrows of outrageous romance"
I stole that from Willy the Shake
You know--"Neither a borrower nor a lender be"
Romeo, Romeo talk to me

Is your silence that golden
Are you comfortable in it
Is it the key to your freedom
Or is it the bars on your prison
Are you gagged by your ribbons
Are you really exclusive or just miserly
You spend every sentence as if it was marked currency
Come and spend some on me--
Shut me up and talk to me
I'm always talking
Chicken squawking
Please talk to me

"Jericho"

I'll try to keep myself open up to you
That's a promise that I made to love
When it was new
"Just like Jericho" I said
"Let these walls come tumbling down"
I said it like I finally found the way
To keep the good feelings alive
I said it like it was something to strive for

I'll try to keep myself open up to you
And approve your self expression
I need that, too
I need your confidence, baby
And the gift of your extra time
In turn I'll give you mine
Sweet darling, it's a rich exchange
It seems to me
It's a warm arrangement

Anyone will tell you
Just how hard it is to make and keep a friend
Maybe they'll short sell you
Or maybe it's you
Judas, in the end
When you just can no longer pretend
That you're getting what you need
Or you're giving out anything for them to grow and feed on

I'll try to keep myself open up to you
It gets easier and easier to do
Just like Jericho
Let these walls come tumbling down now
Let them fall right on the ground
Let all these dogs go running free
The wild and the gentle dogs
Kenneled in me

"Paprika Plains"

It fell from midnight skies
It drummed on the galvanized
In the washroom, women tracked the rain
Up to the make-up mirror
Liquid soap and grass
And Jungle Gardenia crash
On Pine-Sol and beer 
It's stifling in here 
I've got to get some air 
I'm going outside to get some air

Back in my hometown
They would have cleared the floor
Just to watch the rain come down
They're such sky oriented people
Geared to changing weather 
I'm floating off in time
I'm floating off
I'm floating off in time

When I was three feet tall
And wide eyed open to it all
With their tasseled teams they came
To McGee's General Store
All in their beaded leathers
I would tie on colored feathers
And I'd beat the drum like war 
I would beat the drum like war
I'd beat the drum
I'd beat the drum like war

But when the church got through
They traded their beads for bottles
Smashed on Railway Avenue
And they cut off their braids
And lost some link with nature
I'm floating into dreams
I'm floating off
I'm floating into my dreams

I dream paprika plains
Vast and bleak and God forsaken
Paprika plains
And a turquoise river snaking

(Where crows gaze vigilant on wires
Where cattle graze the grasses
Far from the digits of business hours
The moon clock wanes and waxes
But here all time is stripped away
Nowhere on these plains
Is a sprout or an egg in evidence
To measure loss or gain 
Only a little Indian band
Come down from some windy mesa
No women to make them food and child
No expressions on their faces
I'm low in a helicopter
And the wind from whirling blades
Flaps their woven blankets
And flags their raven braids
How came they to this emptiness
How came they to this dream
How came I to this view
From a flying machine
Of earth and air and water
And a band of Indian men
Without herds or flocks or crops
Or families or fires to tend
Like a phoenix up from ashes now
A blanket figure springs
With a fist raised up to turquoise skies
Like liberty
And at the point of vanishing
Where the sky and the earth meet
A bomb blooms
Deadly mushroom
White
Gold
Heat
Like a phoenix up from ashes
Up from violent mysteries
And growing 'till the giant blast
Is to it like a golfer's tee
there comes a child's beach ball
And memory takes me back
to the beach to toss it up
to the garage to get it patched
A pink and yellow beach ball
Rolling
Grand
Detached
Turning the blues and greens of earth
From space probe photographs
I float out of the hovercraft
Naked as infancy
And weightless
And drifting
Horizontally
Like a filing to a magnet
Like the long descent of rain
I am drawn
I fall against the ball
And lose paprika plains
I suckle at my mother's breast
I embrace my mother earth
I remember perforated blinds
Over the crib of my birth
And just as Eve succumbed
To reckless curiosity
I take my sharpest fingernail
And slash the globe to see
Below me
Vast Paprika plains
And the snake the river traces
And a little band of Indian men
With no expressions on their faces)

The rain retreats
Like troops to fall on other fields and streets
Meanwhile they're sweet talking and name calling
And brawling on the fringes of the floor
I spot you through the smoke
With your eyes on fire
From J&B and coke
As I'm coming through the door
I'm coming back
I'm coming back for more
The band plugs in again
You see that mirrored ball begin to sputter lights
And spin
Dizzy on the dancers
Geared to changing rhythms
No matter what you do
I'm floating back
I'm floating back to you

"Otis And Marlena"

Marlena under Foster Grants
She's undercover from the dawns advance
That girl is travel-drained
And the neon mercury vapor stained
Miami sky
It's red as meat
It's a cheap pink rose
Otis in the driver's seat
Watches the street lights fade away
On louvered blocks in green sea air
In fluorescent fossil yards
Slippers are shuffling into folding chairs
Freckled hands are shuffling cards

They've come for fun and sun
While Muslims stick up Washington

Otis empties out the trunk
On the steps of that celebrated dump
Sleazing by the sea
Bow down to her royal travesty
In her ballrooms heads of state
In her bedrooms rented girls
Always the grand parades of cellulite
Jiggling to her golden pools
Through flock and cupid colonnades
They jiggle into surgery
Hopefully beneath the blade
They dream of golden beauty

They've come for fun and sun
While Muslims stick up Washington

Marlena, white as stretcher sheet
Watches it all from her 10th floor balcony
Like it's her opera box
All those Pagliacci summer frocks
Otis is fiddling with the TV dial
All he gets are cartoons and reruns
She taps her glass with an emery file
Watching three rings in the sun
The golden dive, the fatted flake
And sizzle in the mink oil
It's all a dream
She has awake
Checked into Miami Royal
Where they've come for fun and sun
While Muslims hold up Washington
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on
Dream on

"Dreamland"

It's a long, long way from Canada
A long way from snow chains
Donkey vendors slicing coconut
No parkas to their name
Black babies covered in baking flour
The cook's got a carnival song
We're going to lay down some place shady
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland

Walter Raleigh and Chris Columbus
Come marching out of the waves
And claim the beach and all concessions
In the name of the suntan slave
I wrapped that flag around me
Like a Dorothy Lamour sarong
And I lay down thinking national
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland

Goodtime Mary and a fortune hunter
All dressed up to follow the drums
Mary in a feather hula-hoop
Miss Fortune with a rose on her big game gun
All saints, all sinners shining
Heed those trumpets all night long
Propped up on a samba beat
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland

Tar baby and the Great White Wonder
Talking over a glass of rum
Burning on the inside
With the knowledge of things to come
There's gambling out on the terrace
And midnight ramblin' on the lawn
As they lead toward temptation
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland

In a plane flying back to winter
In shoes full of tropic sand
A lady in a foreign flag
On the arm of her Marlboro Man
The hawk howls in New York City
Six foot drifts on Myrtle's lawn
As they push the recline buttons down
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland

African sand on the trade winds
And the sun on the Amazon
As they push the recline buttons down
With dreamland coming on
Dreamland, dreamland
Dreamland, dreamland

"Don Juan's Reckless Daughter"

I'm Don Juan's reckless daughter
I came out two days on your tail
Those two bald-headed days in November
Before the first snowflakes sail
Out on the vast and subtle plains of mystery
A split tongue spirit talks
Noble as a nickel chief
Striking up an old juke box
And he says
"Snakes along the railroad tracks."
He says, "Eagles in jet trails"
He says, "Coils around feathers and talons on scales 
Gravel under the belly plates"
He says, "Wind in the Wings"
He says, "Big bird dragging its tail in the dust 
Snake kite flying on a string."

I come from open prairie
Given some wisdom and a lot of jive
Last night the ghosts of my old ideas
Reran on channel five
And it howled so spooky for its eagle soul
I nearly broke down and cried
But the split tongue spirit laughed at me
He says, "Your serpent cannot be denied."
Our serpents love the whisky bars
They love the romance of the crime
But didn't I see a neon sign
Fester on your hotel blind
And a country road come off the wall
And swoop down at the crowd at the bar
And put me at the top of your danger list
Just for being so much like you are

You're a coward against the altitude
You're a coward against the flesh
Coward caught between yes and no
Reckless this time on the line for yes, yes, yes
Reckless brazen in the play
Of your changing traffic lights
Coward slinking down the hall
To another restless night
As we center behind the eight ball
As we rock between the sheets
As we siphon the colored language
Off the farms and the streets
Here in Good-Old-God-Save-America
The home of the brave and the free
We are all hopelessly oppressed cowards
Of some duality
Of restless multiplicity
(Oh say can you see)

Restless for streets and honky tonks
Restless for home and routine
Restless for country safety and her
Restless for the likes of reckless me
Restless sweeps like fire and rain
Over virgin wilderness
It prowls like hookers and thieves
Through bolt locked tenements
Behind my bolt locked door
The eagle and the serpent are at war in me
The serpent fighting for blind desire
The eagle for clarity
What strange prizes these battles bring
These hectic joys these weary blues
Puffed up and strutting when I think I win
Down and shaken when I think I lose
There are rivets up here in this eagle
There are box cars down there on your snake
And we are twins of spirit
No matter which route home we take
Or what we forsake
We're going to come up to the eyes of clarity
And we'll go down to the beads of guile
There is danger and education
In living out such a reckless life style
I touched you on the central plains
It was plane to train my twin
It was just plane shadow to train shadow
But to me it was skin to skin
The spirit talks in spectrums
He talks to mother earth to father sky
Self indulgence to self denial
Man to woman
Scales to feathers
You and I
Eagles in the sky
You and I
Snakes in the grass
You and I
Crawl and fly
You and I

"Off Night Backstreet"

Maybe I'm just kidding myself when I say I love you
I don't know
Loving without trusting
You get frostbite and sunstroke
I wish I felt nothing
You pimp laughing and strutting her to my chartered seat
Your old off night back street

It's been stinger to stinger, darling
It's been heart to heart
You still keep me from finishing
Any new love I start
Now she's moved in with you
She's keeping your house neat
And your sheets sweet
And I'm your off night back street

I can feel your fingers
Feeling my face
There are some lines you put there
And some you erase
Maybe I'm just dramatizing
I don't care
It's home it can be heaven
When we play fair
But these sentimental journeys
Late at night
High in some back room you're calling me
To be your off night back street

You give me such pleasure
You bring me such pain
Who left her long black hair
In our bathtub drain

"The Silky Veils Of Ardor"

I am a poor wayfaring stranger
Traveling through all these highs and lows
I heard there was no sickness
And no toil or danger
Just mercy and plenty
Where peaceful waters flow
Where peaceful waters flow

Come all you fair and tender school girls
Be careful now when you court young men
They are like the stars
On a summer morning
They sparkle up the night
And they're gone again
Daybreak gone again

If I'd only seen through the silky veils of ardor
What a killing crime this love can be
I would have locked up my heart
In a golden sheath of armor
And kept its crazy beating
Under strictest secrecy
High security

I wish I had the wings
Of Noah's pretty little white dove
So I could fly this raging river
To reach the one I love
But I have no wings
And the water is so wide
We'll have to row a little harder
It's just in dreams we fly
In my dreams we fly

"God Must Be A Boogie Man"

He is three
One's in the middle unmoved
Waiting
To show what he sees
To the other two
To the one attacking so afraid
And the one that keeps trying to love and trust
And getting himself betrayed
In the plan oh
The divine plan
God must be a boogie man

One's so sweet
So overly loving and gentle
He lets people in
To his innermost sacred temple
Blind faith to care
Blind rage to kill
Why'd he let them talk him down
To cheap work and cheap thrills
In the plan oh
The insulting plan
God must be a boogie man

Which would it be
Mingus one or two or three
Which one do you think he'd want the world to see
Well world opinion's not a lot of help
When a man's only trying to find out
How to feel about himself
In the plan oh
The cock-eyed plan
God must be a boogie man

"Funeral"

"..led an enormous band."
[Swede] "Oh, But I know he's very lucky too, because when Mingus dies there's gonna be the same funeral they had for Duke Ellington... in a big church and the whole country's going to say, wow, he was so far out, you know what I mean"
[Charles] "No man, no big church I'm going to be buried man - I got my shit all figured out"
[Swede] "You're going to get a big funeral - you're famous"
[Charles] "Vedanta Society, India, I'm going to be buried in India"
[Swede] "I know, but you're going to get a big funeral in this country, and they'll play your music for two days"
[Charles] "Who's going to do that"
[Swede] "It's far out isn't it, y'know what I mean"
[Charles] "...You want me to hurry up, man"
[Swede] "No I don't want you to hurry up, but in the future, I know you're going to get a beautiful funeral - I can see it"
[Charles] "But I got it all planned, man"
[Swede] "...You're going to be here many more years."
[Charles] "You know the Vedanta Society in India.. Yuga"
[Swede] "Yeah"
[Charles] "Well I'm going to be buried by that church"
[Swede] "Yeah"
[Charles] "So they gotta find another place to do it, that's all."
[Swede] "...Plenty of time to go. You have another fifty years... you're lucky"
[Charles] "Uh, Duke lived to be 77 years old right"
[Swede] "Right"
[Charles] "I'm gonna cut him"
[Swede] "Coltrane was very strong, you know..."
[Charles] "I'm gonna cut Duke"

"A Chair In The Sky"

The rain slammed hard as bars
It caught me by surprise
Mutts of the planet
And shook me down for alibis
I'm waiting
For the keeper to release me
Debating this sentence
Biding my time
In memories
Of old friends of mine
In daydreams of Birdland
I see my soul on fire
Burning up the bandstand
Next time
I'll be bigger
I'll be better than ever
I'll be happily attached
To my cold hard cash
But now Manhattan holds me
To a chair in the sky
With the bird in my ears
And boats in my eyes
Going by

There are things I wish I'd done
Some friends I'm gonna miss
Beautiful lovers
I never got the chance to kiss
Daydreamin' drugs the pain of living
Processions of missing
Lovers and friends
Fade in and they fade out again
In these daydreams of rebirth
I see myself in style
Raking in what I'm worth
Next time
I'll be bigger
I'll be better than ever
I'll be resurrected royal
I'll be rich as Standard Oil
But now Manhattan holds me
To a chair in the sky
With the bird in my ears
And boats in my eyes
Going by

"The Wolf That Lives In Lindsey"

Of the darkness in men's minds
What can you say
That wasn't marked by history
Or the T.V. news today
He gets away with murder
The blizzards come and go
The stab and glare and buckshot
Of the heavy heavy snow
It comes and goes
It comes and goes

His grandpa loved an empire
His sister loved a thief
And Lindsey loved the ways of darkness
Beyond belief
Girls in chilly blouses
The blizzards come and go
The stab and glare and buckshot
Of the heavy heavy snow
It comes and goes
It comes and goes

The cops don't seem to care
For derelicts or ladies of the night
They're weeds for yanking out of sight
If you're smart or rich or lucky
Maybe you'll beat the laws of man
But the inner laws of spirit
And the outer laws of nature
No man can
No no man can

There lives a wolf in Lindsey
That raids and runs
Through the hills of Hollywood
And the downtown slums
He gets away with murder
The blizzards come and go
The stab and glare and buckshot
Of the heavy heavy snow
It comes and goes
It comes and goes

"I's A Muggin'"

I's a muggin, boom bada yada
Bom ba doo boo, we boopa dooboop
I's a muggin'

"Sweet Sucker Dance"

I almost closed the door
Cancelled on everything we opened up for
Tonight the shadows had their say
Their sad notions of the way
Things really are
Damn these blues
They'd turn my heart against you
Since I was fool enough
To find romance
I'm trying to convince myself
This is just a dance

We move in measures
Through loves' changing faces
Needy and nonchalant
Greedy and gracious
Through petty dismissals
And grand embraces
Like it was only a dance

We are survivors
Some get broken
Some get mended
Some can't surrender
They're too well defended
Some get lucky
Some are blessed
And some pretend
This is only a dance

We're dancing fools
You and me
Tonight it's a dance of insecurity
It's my solo
While you're away
Shadows have the saddest thing to say

Love
We can't live without it
Why do we go out and get it
Just to turn around and doubt it
Like we're scared to care
It's hard to talk about it
Aw it's only a dance
Tonight the shadows had their say
There's a sucker born a day
I heard them say
Born to lose
Am I a sucker to love you

You're such a sweet love
You're a proud man
You're a treasure
Time passes gracefully
Living can be such a pleasure
You make it easy to take it in measures
Like it was only a dance

We're dancing fools
You and me
Tonight it's a dance of insecurity
It's my solo
Blue way
And shadows have the saddest things to say

We are survivors
Some get broken
Some get mended
Some can't surrender
They're too well defended
Some get lucky
Some are blessed
And some pretend
It's only a dance

"Coin In The Pocket"

[Charles]
I never hit too, too hard, uh, y'know.
All my life, uh y'know, just everything I touched, turned to gold.
I'm not, I'm not rich but, y'know, I've always had a few, some dollars in my pockets

"The Dry Cleaner From Des Moines"

I'm down to a roll of dimes
I'm stalking the slot that's hot
I keep hearing bells all around me
Jingling in the lucky jackpots
They keep you tantalized
They keep you reaching for your wallet
Here in fools' paradise

I talked to a cat from Des Moines
He said he ran a cleaning plant
That cat was clanking with coin
Well, he must have had a genie in a lamp
'Cause every time
I dropped a dime I blew it
He kept ringing bells nothing to it

He got three oranges, three lemons
Three cherries, three plums
I'm losing my taste for fruit
Watching the dry cleaner do it
Like Midas in a polyester suit
It's all luck, it's just luck
You get a little lucky and you make a little money

I followed him down the strip
He picked out a booth at Circus Circus
Where the cowgirls fill the room with their big balloons
The cleaner was pitching with purpose
He had Dinos and Pooh Bears
And lions, pink and blue there
He couldn't lose there

Des Moines was stacking the chips
Raking off the tables
Ringing the bandit's bells
This is a story that's a drag to tell
(In some ways)
Since I lost every dime
I laid on the line
But the cleaner from Des Moines
Could put a coin
In the door of a John
And get twenty for one
It's just luck

"Lucky"

[Charles] I was lucky, man. God blessed me, y'know I was blessed by God.

"Goodbye Pork Pie Hat"

When Charlie speaks of Lester
You know someone great has gone
The sweetest swinging music man
Had a Porkie Pig hat on
A bright star
In a dark age
When the bandstands had a thousand ways
Of refusing a black man admission
Black musician
In those days they put him in an
Underdog position
Cellars and chitlins'

When Lester took him a wife
Arm and arm went black and white
And some saw red
And drove them from their hotel bed
Love is never easy
It's short of the hope we have for happiness
Bright and sweet
Love is never easy street
Now we are black and white
Embracing out in the lunatic New York night
It's very unlikely we'll be driven out of town
Or be hung in a tree
That's unlikely

Tonight these crowds
Are happy and loud
Children are up dancing in the streets
In the sticky middle of the night
Summer serenade
Of taxi horns and fun arcades
Where right or wrong
Under neon
Every feeling goes on
For you and me
The sidewalk is a history book
And a circus
Dangerous clowns
Balancing dreadful and wonderful perceptions
They have been handed
Day by day
Generations on down

We came up from the subway
On the music midnight makes
To Charlie's bass and Lester's saxophone
In taxi horns and brakes
Now Charlie's down in Mexico
With the healers
So the sidewalk leads us with music
To two little dancers
Dancing outside a black bar
There's a sign up on the awning
It says "Pork Pie Hat Bar"
And there's black babies dancing
Tonight

"Chinese Cafe  Unchained Melody"

Caught in the middle
Carol we're middle class
We're middle aged
We were wild in the old days
Birth of rock 'n' roll days
Now your kids are coming up straight
And my child's a stranger
I bore her
But I could not raise her
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long

Down at the Chinese Cafe
We'd be dreaming on our dimes
We'd be playing "Oh my love, my darling"
One more time

Uranium money
Is booming in the old home town now
It's putting up sleek concrete
Tearing the old landmarks down now
Paving over brave little parks
Ripping off Indian land again
How long how long
Short sighted business men
Ah nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long

Down at the Chinese Cafe
We'd be dreaming on our dimes
We'd be playing "You give your love, so sweetly"
One more time

Christmas is sparkling
Out on Carol's lawn
This girl of my childhood games
With kids nearly grown and gone
Grown so fast
Like the turn of a page
We look like our mothers did now
When we were those kids' age
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Nothing lasts for long
Down at the Chinese Cafe
We'd be dreaming on our dimes
We'd be playing
"Oh my love, my darling
I've hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me"
(Time goes - where does the time go
I wonder where the time goes)

"Wild Things Run Fast"

He came
She smiled
She thought she had him tamed
But he was just as wild
Eating from her hand at last
Wild things run fast

In the dark
He could see
The trap that was lying in her
Sweet company
Eating from her hand at last
Wild things run fast

Winter beat the pines about
He heard the heater
Cutting in and out
While she dreamed away 

In the night
It snowed
Fast tracks in the powder white
Leading out to the road
Winding from her tender grasp
Wild things run fast
Wild things run fast
Wild things run fast

What makes you run
Wild thing
I thought you loved me

"Ladies Man"

Well, I've heard of heartbreakers
But you take the cake
Ladies' man
You could charm the diamonds
Off a rattlesnake
Ladies' man
Ladies bring it on over
When you give 'em the glance
They don't stand a chance
First, you unfold them
Then you pigeon-hole 'em
Ladies' man

Well it sure takes a lot of
Good natured self-control
Ladies' man
When I'm so hot for you and
You're so cold, so cold
Ladies' man
Why do you keep on trying to
Make a man of me
Couldn't you just love me
Like you love cocaine
Cocaine head games

Cross my heart I swear
I'm not trying to trick you
No tricks
Ladies' man
It's just a straight ahead feeling
I have for you
Nothing slick
Ladies' man
I guess you learn to refuse
What you think you can't handle
You're acting like a vandal
Wrecking the dream
At the first bad scene
Ladies' man
Ladies' man
Ladies' man
Ladies' man

"Moon At The Window"

It takes cheerful resignation
Heart and humility
That's all it takes
A cheerful person told me
Nobody's harder on me than me
How could they be
And nobody's harder on you than you

Betsy's blue
She says, "Tell me something good"
You know I'd help her out if I only could
Oh, but sometimes the light
Can be so hard to find
At least the moon at the window
The thieves left that behind

People don't know how to love
They taste it and toss it
Turn it off and on
Like a bathtub faucet
Oh sometimes the light
Can be so hard to find
At least the moon at the window
The thieves left that behind

I wish her heart
I know these battles
Deep in the dark
When the spooks of memories rattle
Ghosts of the future
Phantoms of the past
Rattle, rattle, rattle
In the spoon and the glass

Is it possible to learn
How to care and yet not care
Since love has two faces
Hope and despair
And pleasure always turns to fear
I find
At least the moon at the window
The thieves left that behind
At least they left the moon
Behind the blind
Moon at the window

"Solid Love"

Open my heart you do
You open my heart
You do

I'm gonna give you my very best
You are my happiness
You
Open my heart up you do

"Be Cool"

If there's one rule to this game
Everybody's gonna name
It's be cool
If you're worried or uncertain

"(You're So Square) Baby I Don't Care"

You're so square, baby
You're so square 
Oh, you don't like greasy diners
You don't like sleazy bands
You just wanna go
To a movie show
And sit there holding hands
You're so square
Baby I don't care

You don't like going to parties
To toot and talk all night long
You just wanna park
Where it's nice and dark
And kiss me sweet and strong
You're so square
Darling, I don't care

You don't know any dance steps that are new
But nobody else could love me the way you do

I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why
I love you baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square
Baby, I don't care

Oh, I don't know why my heart flips
I only know it does
I wonder why
I love you baby
I guess it's just because
You're so square
I don't care

You're so square

"You Dream Flat Tires"

It came to pass
Like lightning striking from above
Electric flash
Just like lightening striking from above
Struck by precious love
Precious, precious love
So hopeless and so inspired
Why do you dream flat tires
When you dream flat tires
You dream flat tires

With a jack and a spare you're there
Trying to get to where love is
Coming in on a wing and a prayer
Trying to get to where love is
'Cause love is precious love
You said it was precious
When first you felt my fire
Before you dreamed flat tires
You dreamed flat tires
You dream flat tires

"Woman she bounce back easy
But a man could break both his legs"
Are you telling me this to tease me
Or just to hear me beg
"Please don't go"

Cause I know that you love me
But when are you going to let love be
Just a vague flirtation
Or extra special company
'Cause love is precious love
Everybody knows it's precious
When first they feel that fire
Before they dream flat tires
They dream flat tires
They dream flat tires

"Woman she bounce back easy
But a man could break both his legs"
Do you tell me that to tease me
Or just to hear me beg
"Please don't be cold"

I know that you love me
But what are you going to let love do
(Flat tires, love, love is precious, flat tires,
Love, love is precious, flat tires, love,
Love is precious)

"Man To Man"

No demands
Just pleasurable sensations
Hand in hand
No far reaching plans
No, no hand in hand
Well I keep on trying to understand
Daylight bright
How come I keep moving
From man to man to man
Giving my sweet love
Tasting sweet love
Woman to man

Sometimes it's easy
You drift with the empty gladness
Like it all belongs
Sometimes it's low down sadness
Like it's all gone so wrong
When I saw you standing there
I said to myself
Mmm here's a place
I could break down and care
I'll give him my sweet love
Taste his sweet love
Real sweet love
Woman to man

I don't like to lie
But I sure can be phony when I get scared
I put my nose up in the air
Stoney, stoney when I get scared
When I saw you standing there
I was scared
I thought
Oh I hope he can care
I sure hope I can care
I hope we can really care
And share woman to man
Cause I've been moving
Man to man to man to man to man
Oh what am I looking for
Man to man to man to man
A lot of good guys gone through my door
Man to man to man to man
To man to man to man
Man to man to man to man
Woman to man

"Underneath The Streetlight"

Yes I do I love you
I swear on the stars above I do
I swear on the streetlight on the corner
Shoving back the shadows
One shadow cursing
Another shadow laughing
Underneath the streetlight
I don't know where they're coming from
I just see 'em passing
Underneath the streetlight 

Yes I do I love you
I swear on the buildings above I do
I swear on a billion yellow and T.V. blue windows
Gayboys with their pants so tight
Out in the neon light
Underneath the street light
A m-m-madman - madman
Kicking over garbage cans
Underneath the streetlight 

Yes I do I love you
I swear on the blinkin' planes above I do
I swear on the truck at the stoplight
With his airbrakes moaning
All night the trucks roll
Up to the tunnel-toll
Underneath the streetlight
They come rollin', rollin'
Rollin' for a living
Underneath the streetlight 

Yes I do I love you
I swear on the disco sparkle dark I do
I swear on the be-bop boys
Chasing the black bird
Rock 'n' roll broadcast
Movin' up now full blast
Underneath the streetlight
They come dancin', dancin'
Really rock 'n rollin'
Underneath the streetlight
Yes I do I love you
I really love you
Yes I do yes I do
I love you

"Love (Corinthians II13)"

Although I speak in tongues
Of men and angels
I'm just sounding brass
And tinkling cymbals without love

Love suffers long
Love is kind
Enduring all things
Love has no evil in mind

If I had the gift of prophecy
And all the knowledge
And the faith to move the mountains
Even if I understood all of the mysteries
If I didn't have love
I'd be nothing

Love never looks for love
Love's not puffed up
Or envious
Or touchy
Because it rejoices in the truth
Not in iniquity
Love sees like a child sees

As a child I spoke as a child
I thought and I understood as a child
But when I became a woman
I put away childish things
And began to see through a glass darkly

Where as a child I saw it face to face
Now I only know it in part
Fractions in me
Of faith and hope and love
And of these great three
Love's the greatest beauty
Love
Love
Love

"Good Friends"

I have to come and see you
Maybe once or twice a year
I think nothing would suit me better
(Right now)
Than some downtown atmosphere 

In the dance halls and the galleries
Or betting in the OTB
Synchronized like magic
Good friends you and me

The sun goes down in Jersey
Rises over Little Italy
We could talk it up 'til the block gets up
Swapping stories

Sitting around in some all-night zoo
Watching it run like a movie
Synchronized like magic
Good friends you and me

No hearts of gold
No nerves of steel
No blame for what we can and cannot feel

But now it's cloak and dagger
Walk on eggshells and analyze
Every particle of difference
Oh, gets like mountains in our eyes

You say, "You're unscrupulous"
You say, "You're naive"
Synchronized like magic
Good friends you and me

No hearts of gold
No nerves of steel
No blame for what we can and cannot feel

Sometimes change comes at you
Like a broadside accident
There is chaos to the order
Random things you can't prevent

There could be trouble around the corner
There could be beauty down the street
Synchronized like magic
Good friends you and me

No hearts of gold
No nerves of steel
No blame for what we can and cannot feel

No nerves of steel
No hearts of gold
No blame for what we can and can't control

Good friends you and me
Good friends you and me

"The Three Great Stimulants"

I picked the morning paper off the floor
It was full of other people's little wars
Wouldn't they like their peace
Don't we get bored
And we call for the three great stimulants
Of the exhausted ones

Artifice, brutality and innocence
Artifice and innocence

No tanks have ever rumbled through these streets
and the drone of planes at night has never frightened me
I keep the hours and the company that I please
And we call for the three great stimulants
Of the exhausted ones

Artifice, brutality and innocence
Artifice and innocence

Oh and deep in the night
Our appetites find us
Release us and blind us
Deep in the night
While madmen sit up building bombs
And making laws and bars
They'd like to slam free choice behind us

I saw a little lawyer on the tube
He said, "It's so easy now, anyone can sue."
"Let me show you how your petty aggravations can profit you"
Call for the three great stimulants
Of the exhausted ones

Artifice, brutality and innocence
Artifice and innocence

Oh and deep in the night
Appetites find us
Release us and blind us
Deep in the night
While madmen sit up building bombs
And making laws and bars
They're gonna slam free choice behind us

Last night I dreamed I saw the planet flicker
Great forests fell like buffalo
Everything got sicker
And to the bitter end
Big business bickered
And they call for the three great stimulants
Of the exhausted ones

Artifice, brutality and innocence
Artifice and innocence

Oh these times, these times
Oh these changing times
Change in the heart of all mankind
Oh these troubled times

"Tax Free"

Front rooms
Back rooms
Slide into tables
Crowd into bathrooms
Joke around
Cheap talk
Deep talk
Talk, talk, talk around the clock

Crawl home
Lie down
Teeth chatter
Heart pounds
I don't feel so good
I don't feel so good
Push a button to escape

Preacher on the tube crying "Lord"
There's evil in this land
([Evangelist] "Rock and roll music")
"Cast down these dope fiends
And their noisy bands"
([Evangelist] "Damn their souls")

Preacher preaching love like vengeance
Preaching love like hate
Calling for large donations
Promising estates

Rolling lawns and angel bands
Behind the pearly gates
You know, he will have his in this life
But yours'll have to wait

He's immaculately tax free
([Evangelist] "Multiple hundreds of thousands of ...")
Tax free
([Evangelist] "Hundreds and millions of dollars")
Tax free
([Evangelist] "A hundred billion dollars)
And who is paying the price
Who, who
"Your children are"

Pissed off
Jacked up
Scream into the mike
Spit into the loving cup
Strut like a rooster
March like a man
God's hired hands and the devil bands
Packing the same grandstands

Different clothes
([Evangelist] "Pot in their pockets")
Different hair
([Evangelist] "Sexually active")
Raise a screaming guitar or a Bible in the air
Theatre of anguish
Theatre of glory
God's hired hands and the devil bands

Oh come let us adore me

Lord, there's danger in this land
You get witch hunts and wars
When church and state hold hands
Fuck it

Tonight I'm going dancing
With the drag queens and the punks
Big beat deliver me
From this sanctimonious skunk

We're no flaming angels
And he's not heaven sent
How can he speak for the Prince of Peace
When he's hawk-right militant

And he's immaculately tax free
([Evangelist] "Our nation has lost its guts")
Save me
([Evangelist] "Our nation has lost its strength")
Tax free
([Evangelist] "Our nation has whimpered and cried")
Save me
([Evangelist] "And petted the Castros")
Tax free
([Evangelist] "The Khomeinis' and the Kaddafis'")
Save me
([Evangelist] "For so long")
Tax free
([Evangelist] "That we don't know how to act like a man")
Save me
([Evangelist] "I think that we should turn the United States Marines loose on that little island south of Florida and stop that problem")

"Smokin' (Empty, Try Another)"

Nicotine attack
Nicotine, nicotine

Try another, try another, try another, try another
Empty, empty try another

Try another, try another, try another, try another
Empty, empty try another

Try another, try another, try another, try another
Empty, empty try another

Smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke

Try another, try another, try another, try another

"Dog Eat Dog"

Dog eat dog

It's dog eat dog
I'm just waking up
The dove is in the dungeon
And the white-washed hawks peddle hate and call it love
Dog eat dog
Holy hope in the hands of
Snakebite evangelists and racketeers
And big-wig financiers

Dog eat dog
On prime-time crime the victim begs
Money is the road to justice
And power walks it on crooked legs
Prime-time crime
Holy hope in the hands of
Snakebite evangelists and racketeers
And big-wig financiers

Where the wealth's displayed
Thieves and sycophants parade
And where it's made
The slaves will be taken
Some are treated well
In these games of buy and sell
And some like poor beasts
Are burdened down to breaking

Dog eat dog
It's dog eat dog, ain't it Flim Flam man
Dog eat dog, you can lie, cheat, skim, scam
Beat 'em any way you can
Dog eat dog
You'll do well in this land of
Snakebite evangelists and racketeers
You could get to be
A big-wig financier

Land of snap decisions
Land of short-attention spans
Nothing is savored
Long enough to really understand
In every culture in decline
The watchful ones among the slaves
Know all that is genuine will be
Scorned and conned and cast away

Dog eat dog
People looking, seeing nothing
Dog eat dog
People listening, hearing nothing
Dog eat dog
People lusting, loving nothing
Dog eat dog
People stroking, touching nothing
Dog eat dog
Knowing nothing
Dog eat dog

"Shiny Toys"

Shiny toys right on time
Shiny toys right on time
Shiny toys

I'm reading people rags in the checkout lane
Look, here's a hunk here's a honey
Celebrated people and their claims to fame
Here's a boy and his money
And pictures of the winners in the latest
Ratepoll games

Whatever makes you "Yahoo"
Whatever makes your time feel satisfyin'
Whatever makes you
"Oh I am so excited"
Whatever makes you feel like you're right on time

Party night
Good bands all over town
(Good, good, good)
Mega lights and supersonic sounds
(Good, good, good)
Flashy boys and girls that really play
(Good, good, good)
Shiny toys, when it's over don't you hate
To have to put your toys away

Shiny toys
"I love my Porsche"
Shiny toys
Shiny toys
"I love my Porsche"
Shiny toys
Simple joys

Walking on the beach at the end of the day
Between the sand and the seagulls
Watching the glorious sun setting on the bay
Here comes a boy and his beagle
Walking with a man in a toupee
And a man with his head shaved

Whatever makes you "Mmmm, mmmm"
Whatever makes your time feel satisfyin'
Whatever makes you "Mmmmm, mmmm"
Whatever makes you feel like you're right on time

Party night
Super bands all over town
(Good, good, good)

"Ethiopia"

Hot winds and hunger cries
Ethiopia
Flies in your babies' eyes
Ethiopia
Walking sticks on burning plains
Betrayed by politics
Abandoned by the rains

On and on the human need
On and on the human greed profanes

Ethiopia Ethiopia Ethiopia

Your top soil flies away
Ethiopia
We pump ours full of poison spray
Ethiopia
Between the brown skies and sprinkling lawns
I hear the whine of chain saws
Hacking rain forests down

On and on insanities
On and on short-sighted greed abounds

Ethiopia Ethiopia Ethiopia

Little garden planet oasis in space
Some hearts hurt they can hardly stand it
Famine phantoms at the garden gates

Ethiopia Ethiopia Ethiopia

Every Sunday on TV
Ethiopia
You suffer with such dignity
Ethiopia
A TV star with a PR smile
Calls your baby "it" while strolling
Through your tragic trials

On and on stupidity
On and on the basic needs are defiled
Good air good water good earth

Ethiopia Ethiopia Ethiopia

Little garden planet oasis in space
Some hearts hurt they can hardly stand the waste

"Impossible Dreamer"

The street was loud
From an angry crowd and
I thought of you, I thought of you
Dreamer
Land of the free
No hungry bellies
Impossible
Impossible dreamer

In the darkest part of the night
Blue shadows conjure you
And in the brightest height of the daylight
Sometimes I blink 'cause I think I see you
Dreaming like you do

The moon was bright
Like day for night
And I thought of you
I thought of you
Dreamer
No acid rain
Love without pain
Impossible
Impossible dreamer

In the darkest part of the night
Blue shadows conjure you
And at the brightest height of the daylight
Sometimes I blink 'cause I think I see you
Dreaming like you do

The room was dark
And full of sharks
And I thought of you
I thought of you
Dreamer
Give peace a chance
Don't think just dance
Impossible
Impossible dreamer

In the darkest part of the night
Blue shadows conjure you
And at the brightest height of the daylight
Sometimes I blink 'cause I think I see you
Dreaming like you do

"Lucky Girl"

I'm a lucky girl
I found my friend
I've been all around the world
Mission impossible
Chasing the rainbow's end

Wise guys
Shy guys
And sly lover boys
With big bad bedroom eyes
I never loved a man I trusted
As far as I could pitch my shoe
'Til I loved you

You're my lucky star
You're my magician
You make the night prowling disappear
Vanished from the star wars bars
Empty repetition
I get my heart full here

Playboys
Stray boys
And "Say, hey, hey" boys'll treat you like a toy
I never loved a man I trusted
As far as I could pitch my shoe
'Til I loved you

Cheaters
Woman beaters
And Huck Finn shucksters hopping parking meters
I never loved a man I trusted
As far as I could pitch my shoe
'Til I loved you

I'm a lucky girl
I found my friend
I been all around the world
Mission impossible
Chasing the rainbow's end

Wise guys
Booby-prize guys
And sly lover boys
With big bad bedroom eyes
I never loved a man I trusted
As far as I could throw my shoe
'Til I loved you

"My Secret Place"

I'm going to take you to
My special place
It's a place that you
Like no one else I know
Might appreciate
I don't go there with anyone but
You're a special case
For my special place
For my secret place

People talk to tell you something
Or to take up space
Guess I'm only talking
To be talking to
Your pretty face
I don't talk much to anyone but
You're a special case
For my special place
My secret place

I was born and raised
In New York City
I'm just getting used to Colorado
Oh street bravado
Carry me
Why did you bring me to
A place so wild and pretty
Are there pigeons in this park
Muggers after dark
In these golden trees
In the secret place

I'm going to take you to
My special place
It's a place no amount of hurt and anger
Can deface
I put things back together there
It all falls right in place
In my special space
My special place

Once I saw a film
In New York City
That was shot in Colorado
Girl meets desperado
In the trembling mountain trees
Out of all of the girls that you see
In bleachers and cafe windows
Sitting flirting with someone
Looking to have some fun
Why did you pick me
For the secret place

"Lakota"

I am Lakota
Lakota
Looking at money man
Diggin' the deadly quotas
Out of balance
Out of hand

We want the land
Lay down the reeking ore
Don't you hear the shrieking in the trees
Everywhere you touch the earth she's sore
Every time you skin her all things weep
Your money mocks us
Restitution what good can it do
Kenneled in metered boxes
Red dogs in debt to you

I am Lakota
Lakota
Fighting among ourselves
All we can say with one whole heart
Is we won't sell
No we'll never sell

We want the land
The lonely coyote calls
In the woodlands footprints of the deer
In the barrooms poor drunk bastard falls
In the courtrooms deaf ears sixty years
You think we're sleeping but
Quietly like rattlesnakes and stars
We have seen the trampled rainbows
In the smoke of cars

I am Lakota
Brave
Sun pity me
I am Lakota
Broken
Moon pity me
I am Lakota
Grave
Shadows stretching
Lakota
Oh pity me

I am Lakota
Weak
Grass pity me
I am Lakota
Faithful
Rocks pity me
I am Lakota
Meek
Standing water
Lakota
Oh pity me

I am Lakota
Lakota
Standing on sacred land
We never sold these Black Hills
To the missile heads
To the power plants

We want the land
The bullet and the fence broke Lakota
The black coats and the booze broke Lakota
Courts that circumvent choke Lakota
Nothing left to lose
Tell me grandfather
You spoke the fur and feather tongues
Do you hear the whimpering waters
When the tractors come

I am Lakota
Brave
Sun pity me
I am Lakota
Broken
Moon pity me
I am Lakota
Slave
Shadows stretching
Lakota
Oh pity me

I am Lakota
Weak
Grass pity me
I am Lakota
Faithful
Rocks pity me
I am Lakota
Meek
Standing water
Lakota
Oh pity me

Sun pity me
Mother earth

Moon pity me

Stretching on the forest floor

Oh pity me

Standing in a wakan manner

"The Tea Leaf Prophecy (Lay Down Your Arms)"

Study war no more
Lay down your arms
Study war no more
Lay 'em down lay 'em down now
Study war no more
Lay down your arms
Study war no more

Newsreels rattle the Nazi dread
The able-bodied have shipped away
Molly McGee gets her tea-leaves read
You'll be married in a month they say
"These leaves are crazy
Look at this town there's no men left
Just frail old boys and babies
Talking to teacher in the treble clef"

She plants her garden in the spring
She does the winter shovelling
Tokyo Rose on the radio
She says she's leavin' but she don't go

Out of the blue just passin' thru
A young flight sergeant
On two weeks leave
Says "Molly McGee no one else will do"
And seals the tea-leaf prophecy
Oh these nights are strong and soft
Private passions and secret storms
Nothin' about him ticks her off
And he looks so cute in his uniform

She plants her garden in the spring
He does the winter shovelling
But summer's just a sneeze
In a long long bad winter cold
She says "I'm leavin' here" but she don't go

"Sleep little darlin'
This is your happy home
Hiroshima cannot be pardoned
Don't have kids when you get grown
Because this world is shattered
The wise are mourning
The fools are joking
Oh what does it matter
The wash needs ironing
And the fire needs stoking"

She plants her garden in the spring
He does the winter shovelling
The three of 'em laughing 'round the radio
She says "I'm leavin' here" but she don't go

She plants her garden in the spring
They do the winter shovelling
They sit up late and watch the
Johnny Carson show
She says "I'm leavin' here but she don't go".

"Dancin' Clown"

No, you couldn't call Jesse a babe in the woods
He's just weak in self-defense
'Cause he's so thin skinned
He can't take a joke at his expense
"You're a push button window," says Rowdy Yates
"I can run you up and down
Anytime I want
I can make you my dancin'
My dancin' clown"
You're my dancin' clown
Dancin' dancin'
Dancin' clown
Dancin'
You're my dancin' clown
Dancin' dancin' dancin'
Dancin' clown

Rowdy Yates is as bold as Jove
He's all chide and snide and bluff
Stuck in the romantic tradition
Of acting rough and tough
"You're always charging thru," says Jesse
Nervous, lookin' all around
To see who's seein' him bein' a dancin'
A dancin' clown
He's a dancin' clown
Dancin' dancin'
Dancin' clown
Dancin'
He's a dancin' clown
Dancin' dancin' dancin'
Dancin' clown

Cherchez la femme
Whenever love comes around
Someone's a dancin' clown
Cherchez la femme
Whenever hearts start to pound
Someone's a dancin' clown

Down the street comes last-word Suzie
She's high yellow, lookin' top nice
You hear the swoosh of jungle blades
And the crackle of northern ice
"Hot damn" says Rowdy lookin' up
"Yum" says Jesse lookin' down
"How would you like to be her dancin'
Her dancin' clown"
Be her dancin' clown
Dancin' dancin'
Dancin' clown
Dancin'
Be her dancin' clown
Dancin' dancin' dancin'
Dancin' clown

Cherchez la femme
Whenever love comes to town
Someone's a dancin' clown
Cherchez la femme
Wherever hearts start to pound
Someone's a dancin' clown

"Cool Water"

All day I face the barren waste
Without a taste of water
Cool water
Old Dan and I
Our throats slate dry
Our spirits cry out for water
Cool clear water
Keep on movin' Dan
Some devils had a plan
Buried poison in the sand
Don't drink it man
It's in the water
Cool clear water
In my mind I see
A big green tree
And a river flowin' free
Waitin' up ahead
For you and me
Cool clear water

The nights are cool and I'm a fool
Each star is a pool of water
Cool water
But come the dawn
We carry on
We won't last long without water
Cool clear water
Keep on movin' Dan
We're still in no-man's land
Dry bones and sand
People never planned here for water
Cool clear water
In my mind I see
A big green tree
And a river flowin' free
Waiting up ahead for you and me
Cool clear water

The shadows sway
They seem to say
Tonight we pray for water
Cool water
And way up there
If you care
Please show us where
There's good water
Cool clear water

"The Beat Of Black Wings"

I met a young soldier
He said his name was Killer Kyle
He was shakin' all over
Like a night-frightened child
This is his story
It's a tough one for me to sing
Hard as the squawk and the flap
And the beat ofthe beat of black wings

Charley Angel
Charley Angel
Charley Angel

"They gave me a gun," he said
"They gave me a mission
For the power and the glory
Propaganda piss on 'em
There's a war zone inside me
I can feel things exploding
I can't even hear the fucking music playing
For the beat of the beat of black wings."

Charley Angel
Charley Angel
Charley Angel

Charley Angel
Charley Angel
Charley Angel

He said, "I never had nothin'
Nothin' I could believe in
My girl killed our unborn child
Without even grieving
I put my hands on her belly
To feel the kid kickin' damn
She'd been to some clinic
Oh the beat of black wings."

Charley Angel
Charley Angel
Charley Angel

"They want you they need you
They train you to kill
To be a pin on some map
Some vicarious thrill
The old hate the young
That's the whole heartless thing
The old pick the wars
We die in 'em
To the beat ofthe beat of black wings."

Charley Angel
Charley Angel
Charley Angel

"There's a man drawing pictures
On the sidewalk with chalk
Just as fast as he draws 'em
Rain come down and wash 'em off
Keep the drinks comin', girl
'Til I can't feel anything
I'm just a chalk mark in a rainstorm
I'm just the beat of black wings."

"Snakes And Ladders"

He
In a shopping mall
Finally met the perfect girl
She is all that matters
The only one in all the world
Like a Barbie doll
Oh love is snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

She
Just to have and hold
Is the perfect air-brushed angel
Makes you hot just looking at her
Stapled into all his braincells
Like a centerfold
Oh love is snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom climb back up
Buy the townhouse
Call the preacher
Get to the bottom climb back up
Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom climb back up
Set up credit for the lovely creature
The lovely creature

He
On a corporate climb
Set his sights on power for her
On a silver platter
He gave up happy hour for her
Perrier and lime
Oh love is snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders
She
In a handsome world
Put her mind to social graces
All the privileged chatter
Setting pretty table places
For the girls in pearls
Oh love is snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom climb back up
Buy the carphone
Call the broker
Get to the bottom climb back up
Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom climb back up
Buy the wife a diamond choker
A diamond choker

True love true love true love
He's so nervous
New love new love new love
When he's with her
Oh he's wasting away
True love true love true love
It's so curious
New love new love new love
Just to kiss her
To kiss her to kiss her to kiss her
To kiss her to kiss her to kiss her
To kiss her he has to shave

She
In the gilded mirrors
In the swing of fancy places
Where the black ties flatter
Started seeing other faces
Young fogie financiers
Oh love is snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

See
In the crimes of time
How the seasons steal away
How the rungs are shattered
First you're green then you're grey
Still the snakes unwind
Still playin' snakes and ladders
Snakes and ladders

Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom climb back up
Sell the vineyard
Call the lawyer
Get to the bottom climb back up
Get to the top and slide back down
Get to the bottom climb back up
Gather garbage to destroy her
To destroy her

Ladders ladders ladders
The perfect girl
Ladders ladders ladders
The paper chase Love is snakes and ladders
Ladders ladders ladders
The social whirl
Ladders ladders
The rat race

"The Reoccuring Dream"

This is the reoccurring dream
Born in the dreary gap between

And what we wish we could have

More fulfilling and less frustrating

"A Bird That Whistles"

I took a house by the water
Took a man on a mountainside
Pretty house by the water
Lovely lover by the waterside
Last time I saw that man
He hung down his head and cried

Corrina, Corrina
Do you have to go
Corrina, Corrina
Tell me why do you have to go
Just made me come to love you girl
Now you pack your things and go
Leave me this bird that whistles
Leave me this bird that sings

I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that's singin'
If I don't have you darlin'
Birds don't mean nothin'

"Night Ride Home"

Once in a while
In a big blue moon
There comes a night like this
Like some surrealist
Invented this 4th of July
Night ride home

Hula girls
And caterpillar tractors in the sand
The ukulele man
The fireworks
This 4th of July
Night ride home

I love the man beside me
We love the open road
No phones till Friday
Far from the overkill
Far from the overload

Back at the bar
The band tears down
But out here in the headlight beams
The silver powerlines
Gleam
On this 4th of July
Night ride home

Round the curve
And a big dark horse
Red taillights on his hide
Is keeping right alongside
Rev for stride
4th of July
Night ride home

I love the man beside me
We love the open road
No phones till Friday
Far from the undertow
Far from the overload

Once in awhile
In a big blue moon
There comes a night like this
Like some surrealist
Invented this 4th of July
Night ride home

"Passion Play (When All The Slaves Are Free)"

Magdalene is trembling
Like a washing on a line
Trembling and gleaming
Never before was a man so kind
Never so redeeming

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue
In radiation rose
Ecstasy
Now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free
(Who're you gonna get)

I am up a sycamore
Looking through the leaves
A sinner of some position
Who in the world can this heart healer be
This magical physician

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue
In radiation rose
Misery
Now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free
(Who're you gonna get)

Enter the multitudes
The walking wounded
They come to this diver of the heart
Of the multitudes
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done

Oh, climb down, climb down he says to me
From the middle of unrest
They think his light is squandered
But he sees a stray in the wilderness
And I see how far I've wandered

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue
In radiation rose
Apathy
Now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free
(Who're you gonna get)

Enter the multitudes
The walking wounded
They come to this diver of the heart
Of the multitudes
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done

Oh, all around the marketplace
The buzzing of the flies
The buzzing and the stinging
Divinely barren
And wickedly wise
The killer nails are ringing

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue
In radiation rose
Tragedy
Now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free
(Who're you gonna get)

"Cherokee Louise"

Cherokee Louise is hiding in this tunnel
In the Broadway bridge
We are crawling on our knees
We've got flashlights and batteries
We've got cold cuts from the fridge

Last year about this time
We used to climb up in the branches
Just to sway there in some breeze
Now the cops on the street
They want Cherokee Louise

People like to talk
Tongues are waggin' over fences
Waggin' over phones
All their doors are locked
God she can't even come to our house
But I know where she'll go

To the place where you can stand
And press your hands like it was bubble bath
In dust piled high as me
Down under the street
My friend poor Cherokee Louise

Ever since we turned thirteen
It's like a minefield
Walking to the door
Going out you get the third degree
And comin' in you get the third world war

Tuesday after school
We put our pennies on the rails
And when the train went by
We were jumpin' round like fools
Going "Look no heads or tails"
Going "Look my lucky prize"

She runs home to her foster dad
He opens up a zipper
And he yanks her to her knees
Oh please be here please
My friend poor Cherokee Louise

Cherokee Louise is hiding in this tunnel
In the Broadway bridge
We're crawling on our knees
I've got Archie and Silver Screen
I know where she is

The place where you can stand
And press your hands like it was bubble bath
In dust piled high as me
Down under the street
My friend poor Cherokee Louise

Oh Cherokee Louise, poor Cherokee Louise
Cherokee Louise, Cherokee Louise

"The Windfall (Everything For Nothing)"

You think I should buy you a car
Why Because Elvis did
No. Come on

Because Elvis gave 'em cars
You think I'm cheap
And you're hard done by
Look you live here like a star
Rent free suite
Big blue pool that you sun by
Trips to tropic shores
Clothes from fancy stores
You want too much
You want too badly
You want everything for nothing

Going to the church
You chant
For my downfall
Chanting for my house
My friends
You want it all
The pillows on my bed
The visions in my head
You want too much
You want too badly
You want everything for nothing

In the land of litigation
The courts are like game shows
Take what's behind the curtain
The jury cries
I'm not going to be the jackpot
At the end of your perjured rainbow
Not if local justice has even one good eye

Oh it's not like I was blind
I saw
But I took no action
As you began to climb
Green clawed
Dissatisfaction
It wasn't hard to guess
That the end would be a mess
You want too much
You want too badly
You want everything for nothing

In the land of mass frustration
The judges are sleeping
Counting wooly little lawyers
And grinding their teeth
Outside my sleepless window
The Hollywood sirens are shrieking
While down some searchlit alley runs
Some lost belief

Oh I'm tangled in your lies
Your scam
Your spider web
Spit spun between the trees
Doors slam
You want my head
You'd eat your young alive
For a jaguar in the drive
You lie too much
You lie too badly
You want everything for nothing

"Slouching Towards Bethlehem"

Turning and turning
Within the widening gyre
The falcon cannot hear the falconer
Things fall apart
The centre cannot hold
And a blood dimmed tide
Is loosed upon the world

Nothing is sacred
The ceremony sinks
Innocence is drowned
In anarchy
The best lack conviction
Given some time to think
And the worst are full of passion
Without mercy

Surely some revelation is at hand
Surely it's the second coming
And the wrath has finally taken form
For what is this rough beast
Its hour come at last
Slouching toward Bethlehem to be born
Slouching toward Bethlehem to be born

Hoping and hoping
As if by my weak faith
The spirit of this world
Would heal and rise
Vast are the shadows
That straddle and strafe
And struggle in the darkness
Troubling my eyes

Shaped like a lion
It has the head of a man
With a gaze as blank
And pitiless as the sun
And it's moving its slow thighs
Across the desert sands
Through dark indignant
Reeling falcons

Surely some revelation is at hand
Surely it's the second coming
And the wrath has finally taken form
For what is this rough beast
Its hour come at last
Slouching toward Bethlehem to be born
Slouching toward Bethlehem to be born
To be born

(Head of a man, shape of a lion)

Raging and raging
It rises from the deep
Opening its eyes
After twenty centuries
Vexed to a nightmare
Out of a stony sleep
By a rocking cradle
By the Sea of Galilee

Surely some revelation is at hand
Surely it's the second coming
And the wrath has finally taken form
For what is this rough beast
Its hour come at last
Slouching toward Bethlehem to be born
Slouching toward Bethlehem to be born
To be born

(Head of a man, shape of a lion)

"Come In From The Cold"

Back in 1957
We had to dance a foot apart
And they hawk-eyed us from the sidelines
Holding their rulers without a heart
And so with just a touch of our fingers
Oh we could make our circuitry explode
All we ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold 

Come in
Come in from the cold
(We were so young)
Oh come in
Come in from the cold

We really thought we had a purpose
We were so anxious to achieve
We had hope
The world held promise
For a slave to liberty
Freely I slaved away for something better
And I was bought and sold
And all I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

Come in
Come in from the cold
(We were so sure)
Oh come in
Come in from the cold

I feel your leg under the table
Leaning into mine
I feel renewed
I feel disabled
By these bonfires in my spine
I don't know who the arsonist was
Which incendiary soul
But all I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold 

Come in
Come in from the cold
(You were so warm)
Oh come in
Come in from the cold

I am not some stone commission
Like a statue in a park
I am flesh and blood and vision
I am howling in the dark
Long blue shadows of the jackals
Are falling on a pay phone by the road
Oh, all they ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

Come in
Come in from the cold
(I was so low)
Oh come in
Come in from the cold

Is this just vulgar electricity
Is this the edifying fire
(It was so pure)
Does your smile's covert complicity
Debase as it admires
(Just a flu with a temperature)
Are you just checking out your mojo
Or am I just fighting off growing old
(Just a high fever)
All I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold

Come in
Come in from the cold
(It was so pure)
Oh come in
Come in from the cold

I know we never will be perfect
Never entirely clear
(When the moon shines)
We get hurt and we just panic
And we strike out
Out of fear
(You were only being kind)
I fear the sentence of this solitude
200 years on hold
(For my loving crime)
Oh and all we ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold 

Come in
Come in from the cold
(When the moon shines)
Oh come in
Come in from the cold

When I thought life had some meaning
Then I thought I had some choice
(I was running blind)
And I made some value judgments
In a self-important voice
(I was outta line)
But then absurdity came over me
And I longed to lose control
(Into no mind)
Oh all I ever wanted
Was just to come in from the cold 

Come in
Come in from the cold
(You were so kind)
Please come in
(So kind)
Come in from the cold
Come in come in
Come in from the cold

"Nothing Can Be Done"

Must I forgive you
Each time
And say you don't know what you're doing
There are no victimless crimes
I know of
Out here in these graffiti ruins
My love

Oh I am not old
I'm told
But I am not young
Oh and nothing can be done
Don't start
My heart
Is a smoking gun
Oh and nothing can be done

I heard you leaving
Late last night
I heard you screaming down the mountain
Like you were running red lights
(Red lights)
You had some trash-can-rock-band pounding

Oh I am not old
I'm told
But I am not young
Oh and nothing can be done
Don't start
My heart
Is a smoking gun
Oh and nothing can be done

Must I surrender
With grace
The things I loved when I was younger
(Sweet embrace)
Must I remember your face
So well
What do I do here with this hunger

Oh I am not old
I'm told
But I am not young
Oh and nothing can be done
Don't start
My heart
Is a smoking gun
Oh and nothing can be done

Nothing can be done
Nothing can be done
Oh nothing can be done

"The Only Joy In Town"

I want to paint a picture
Botticelli style
Instead of Venus on a clam
I'd paint this flower child
"You are the air my flowers breathe"
He calls, and the ladies turn around
On the first day of Spring
I'm looking at the only joy around

He's the only joy around
The only joy I found
The only joy in town

The Spanish steps are crowded
Bunch of bodies brooding there
Dead pan side-walk vendors
Hustling vacant stares
Making all the more exceptional
This fool in a flower crown
On the first day of Spring
I'm looking at the only joy in town

He's the only joy around
The only joy I found
The only joy in town

The Botticelli black boy
With the fuchsias in his hair
Is breathing in women like oxygen
On the Spanish stairs
In my youth I would have followed him
All through this terra-cotta town
On the first day of Spring
We'd dance and sing
And be the only joy around

We'd be the only joy around
The only joy in town
He's the only joy I've found
All day

At night these streets are empty
Where does everybody go
Where are the brash and tender rooms
In Roman candle glow
Where are Fellini's circus'
La Dolce Vita clowns
On the first day of Spring
I'm looking
At the only joy in town

He's the only joy around
The only joy I found
The only joy in town

"Ray's Dad's Cadillac"

Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Rollin' past the rink
Past the record shack
Pink fins in the falling rain
Rollin'
To the blue lights past the water mains

Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Weekends we'd get
Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Rock 'n roll in the dashboard
Romance in the back of
Ray's Dad's Cadillac

Ray's dad teaches math
ero
I'm a dunce
I'm a decimal in his class
Last night's kisses won't erase
ero
I just can't keep the numbers in their place

Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Last night we had
Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Rock 'n roll in the dashboard
Romance in the back of
Ray's Dad's Cadillac

When it comes to mathematics
I got static in the attic
"No sir, nothing's clear"
I'll be blackboard blind on Monday
Dreamin' of blue runways
On the edge of here
A little atmosphere

Blue lights out on airport road
Motown, in a field in a farmer's grove
Big planes comin' overhead
Lowdown
You can see the bolts
You can see the tire treads

Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Weekends we'd get
Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Oh, little darlin'
Rock 'n' roll in the dashboard
Romance in the back of
Ray's Dad's Cadillac

Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Ray's Dad's Cadillac
Ray's Dad's Cadillac

"Two Grey Rooms"

Tomorrow is Sunday
Now there's only one day left to go
Till you walk by
Below my window
The weekends drive me mad
Holidays are oh too sad
'Cause you don't go
Below my window

No one knows I'm here
One day I just disappeared
And I took these two grey rooms up here
With a view
When you walk by
Below my window

You look so youthful
Time has been untruthful
Heaven knows I loved you
30 years ago
Hot days your shirt's undone
Rainy days you run
Oh and then you fade so fast
Below my window

No one knows I'm here
One day I just disappeared
And I took these two grey rooms up here
With a view
Only when you walk by
Below my window
When you walk by

Below my window
Below my window
Hey hey
Below my window
Below my window
Below my window

"Sunny Sunday"

She pulls the shade
It's just another sunny Sunday
She dodges the light like Blanche DuBois
Bright colors fade away on such a sunny Sunday
She waits for the night to fall
Then she points a pistol through the door
And she aims at the streetlight
While the freeway hisses
Dogs bark as the gun falls to the floor
The streetlight's still burning
She always misses
But the day she hits
That's the day she'll leave
That one little victory, that's all she needs
She pulls the shade
It's just another sunny Monday
She waits for the night to fall

"Sex Kills"

I pulled up behind a Cadillac
We were waiting for the light
And I took a look at his license plate
It said 'Just Ice'

Is Justice just ice
Governed by greed and lust
Just the strong doing what they can
And the weak suffering what they must

And the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills

Oh, sex kills

Doctors' pills give you brand new ills
And the bills bury you like an avalanche
And lawyers haven't been this popular
Since Robespierre slaughtered half of France

And Indian chiefs with their old beliefs know
The balance is undone crazy ions
You can feel it out in traffic
Everyone hates everyone

And the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills

Oh, sex kills

All these jackoffs at the office
The rapist in the pool
Oh and the tragedies in the nurseries
Little kids packing guns to school

The ulcerated ozone
These tumors of the skin
This hostile sun beating down on
The massive mess we're in

And the gas leaks
And the oil spills
And sex sells everything
Sex kills

Sex kills
Sex kills
Oh, sex kills
Sex kills

"How Do You Stop"

Hard bodies
Soft emotions
So fast
So smart
The world is at your feet
But what about your heart
Fame and fortune can't hold you tight
In the late late hours of the night

How do you stop
Before it's too late
You choose and you lose
If you hesitate
How do you stop
Before it's too late
You think love will wait
So you don't hold on
And then it's gone

You've had success
Lots of fancy friends
You've tasted the good life
You thought it would never end
One day you're too young
Then you're in your prime
Then you're looking back at the hands of time

How do you stop
Before it's too late
You choose and you lose
If you hesitate
How do you stop
Before it's too late
You think love will wait
So you don't hold on
And then it's gone

How do you stop a runaway train
How do you stop the driving rain
How do you stop the ripening corn
How do you stop a baby being born

How do you stop
Before it's too late
You choose and you lose
If you hesitate
How do you stop
Before it's too late
How do you stop
You're lost if you hesitate
How do you stop
Love from slipping away
How do you stop
Before it's too late

"Turbulent Indigo"

You wanna make Van Goghs
Raise 'em up like sheep
Make 'em out of Eskimos
And women if you please
Make 'em nice and normal
Make 'em nice and neat
You see him with his shotgun there
Bloodied in the wheat
Oh what do you know about
Living in Turbulent Indigo

Brash fields, crude crows
In a scary sky ...
In a golden frame
Roped off
Tourists guided by ...
Tourists talking about the madhouse
Talking about the ear
The madman hangs in fancy homes
They wouldn't let him near
He'd piss in their fireplace
He'd drag them through Turbulent Indigo

"I'm a burning hearth," he said
"People see the smoke
But no one comes to warm themselves
Sloughing off a coat
And all my little landscapes
All my yellow afternoons
Stack up around this vacancy
Like dirty cups and spoons
No mercy Sweet Jesus
No mercy from Turbulent Indigo."

"Last Chance Lost"

Last chance lost
In the tyranny of a long good-bye
Last chance lost
We talk of us with deadly earnest eyes
Last chance lost
We talk of love in terms of sacrifice and compromise
Last chance
Last chance lost

Last chance lost
The hero cannot make the change
Last chance lost
The shrew will not be tamed
Last chance lost
They bicker on the rifle range
Blame takes aim
Last chance
Last chance lost

"The Magdalene Laundries"

I was an unmarried girl
I'd just turned twenty-seven
When they sent me to the sisters
For the way men looked at me
Branded as a Jezebel
I knew I was not bound for Heaven
I'd be cast in shame
Into the Magdalene laundries

Most girls come here pregnant
Some by their own fathers
Bridget got that belly
By her parish priest
We're trying to get things white as snow
All of us woe-begotten-daughters
In the steaming stains
Of the Magdalene laundries

Prostitutes and destitutes
And temptresses like me
Fallen women
Sentenced into dreamless drudgery 
Why do they call this heartless place
Our Lady of Charity
Oh charity

These bloodless brides of Jesus
If they had just once glimpsed their groom
Then they'd know, and they'd drop the stones
Concealed behind their rosaries
They wilt the grass they walk upon
They leech the light out of a room
They'd like to drive us down the drain
At the Magdalene laundries

Peg O'Connell died today
She was a cheeky girl
A flirt
They just stuffed her in a hole
Surely to God you'd think at least some bells should ring
One day I'm going to die here too
And they'll plant me in the dirt
Like some lame bulb
That never blooms come any spring
Not any spring
No, not any spring
Not any spring

"Not To Blame"

The story hit the news
From coast to coast
They said you beat the girl
You loved the most
Your charitable acts
Seemed out of place
With the beauty
With your fist marks on her face
Your buddies all stood by
They bet their fortunes
And their fame
That she was out of line
And you were not to blame

Six hundred thousand doctors
Are putting on rubber gloves
And they're poking
At the miseries made of love
They say they're learning
How to spot
The battered wives
Among all the women
They see bleeding through their lives
I bleed
For your perversity
These red words that make a stain
On your white-washed claim that
She was out of line
And you were not to blame

I heard your baby say
When he was only three
"Daddy, let's get some girls
One for you and one for me."
His mother had the frailty
You despise
And the looks
You love to drive to suicide
Not one wet eye around
Her lonely little grave
Said, "He was out of line girl
You were not to blame."

"Borderline"

Everybody looks so ill at ease
So distrustful so displeased
Running down the table
I see a borderline
Like a barbed wire fence
Strung tight, strung tense
Prickling with pretense
A borderline

Why are you smirking at your friend
Is this to be the night when
All well-wishing ends
All credibility revoked
Thin skin, thick jokes
Can we blame it on the smoke
This borderline

Every bristling shaft of pride
Church or nation
Team or tribe
Every notion we subscribe to
Is just a borderline
Good or bad, we think we know
As if thinking makes things so
All convictions grow along a borderline

Smug in your jaded expertise
You scathe the wonder world
And you praise barbarity
In this illusionary place
This scared hard-edged rat race
All liberty is laced with
Borderlines

Every income, every age
Every fashion-plated rage
Every measure, every gauge
Creates a borderline
Every stone thrown through glass
Every mean-streets-kick ass
Every swan caught on the grass
Will draw a borderline

You snipe so steady
You snub so snide
So ripe and ready
To diminish and deride
You're so quick to condescend
My opinionated friend
All you deface, all you defend
Is just a borderline
Just a borderline ...
Another borderline ...
Just a borderline

"Yvette In English"

He met her in a French cafe
She slipped in sideways like a cat
Sidelong glances
what a wary little stray
She sticks in his mind like that

Saying, "Avez-vous un allumette"
With her lips wrapped around a cigarette
Yvette in English saying,
"Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss."

He's fumbling with her foreign tongue
Reaching for words and drawing blanks
A loud mouth is stricken deaf and dumb
In a bistro on the left bank

"If I were a painter," Picasso said,
"I'd paint this girl from toe to head"
Yvette in English saying,
"Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss."

Burgundy nocturne tips and spills
They trot along nicely in the spreading stain
New chills, new thrills for the old uphill battle
How did he wind up here again

Walking and talking touched and scared
Uninsulated wires laid bare
And Yvette in English going,
"Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss."

What blew her like a leaf his way
Up in the air and down to Earth
First she flusters then she frays
So quick to question her own worth

Her cigarette burns her fingertips
As it falls like fireworks she curses it
Then sweetly in English she says,
"Please have this,
Little bit of instant bliss."

He sees her turn and walk away
Skittering like a cat on stone
Her high heels clicking
What a wary little stray
She leaves him by the Seine alone

With the black water and the amber lights
And the bony bridge between left and right
Yvette in English saying,
"Please have this
Little bit of instant bliss."

"The Sire Of Sorrow (Job's Sad Song)"

Let me speak, let me spit out my bitterness
Born of grief and nights without sleep and festering flesh
Do you have eyes
Can you see like mankind sees
Why have you soured and curdled me
Oh you tireless watcher What have I done to you
That you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true

Once I was blessed I was awaited like the rain
Like eyes for the blind, like feet for the lame
Kings heard my words, and they sought out my company
But now the janitors of Shadowland flick their brooms at me
Oh you tireless watcher What have I done to you
that you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true

([Antagonists] Man is the sire of sorrow)
I've lost all taste for life
I'm all complaints
Tell me why do you starve the faithful
Why do you crucify the saints
And you let the wicked prosper
You let their children frisk like deer
And my loves are dead or dying, or they don't come near
([Antagonists] We don't despise your chastening
God is correcting you)

Oh and look who comes to counsel my deep distress
Oh, these pompous physicians
What carelessness
([Antagonists] Oh all this ranting all this wind
Filling our ears with trash)
Breathtaking ignorance adding insult to injury
They come blaming and shaming
([Antagonists] Evil doer)
And shattering me
([Antagonists] This vain man wishes to seem wise
A man born of asses)
Oh you tireless watcher What have I done to you
That you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true

([Antagonists] We don't despise your chastening)
Already on a bed of sighs and screams,
And still you torture me with visions
You give me terrifying dreams
Better I was carried from the womb straight to the grave.
I see the diggers waiting, they're leaning on their spades.

([Antagonists] Man is the sire of sorrow
Sure as the sparks ascend)
Where is hope while you're wondering what went wrong
Why give me light and then this dark without a dawn
([Antagonists] Evil is sweet in your mouth
Hiding under your tongue)
Show your face
([Antagonists] What a long fall from grace)
Help me understand
What is the reason for your heavy hand
([Antagonists] You're stumbling in shadows
You have no name now)
Was it the sins of my youth
What have I done to you
That you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true
([Antagonists] Oh your guilt must weigh so greatly)
Everything I dread and everything I fear come true
([Antagonists] Man is the sire of sorrow)
Oh you make everything I dread and everything I fear come true

"Harlem In Havana"

At the far end of the midway
by the double ferris wheel
There's a band that plays so snakey
You can't help how you feel
Emmy May ran away
With a man as dark as night
You can see him, if you go there
Second trumpet to the right

They play "Night Train"
So snakey
Black girls dancing
Long and leggy
Barkers barking
Step right up, folks
The show is about to begin
It's Harlem in Havana time
Step right in

Silver spangles 
See 'em dangle
In the farm boys' eyes
Hootchie kootchie
Auntie Ruthie would've cried 
If she knew we were on the inside

When Emmy May ran away
She came back a bottle blonde
God The gossips had a gourmet feast
Chomping on how she went wrong
But miracle of miracles
'Cause we were underage
She got us nearly front row seats
To the right side of the stage

See that tall girl
That's a man
That one, too 
With the yellow feather fan
Barkers barking
Step right up, folks
The show is about to begin
It's Harlem in Havana time
Step right in

Silver spangles 
See 'em dangle
In the farm boys' eyes
Hootchie kootchie
Auntie Ruthie would've died 
If she knew we were on the inside

"Man From Mars"

Since I lost you
I can't get through the day
Without at least one big boo-hoo
The pain won't go away
What am I gonna do
Man from Mars
This time you went too far

I fall apart
Everytime I think of you
Swallowed by the dark
There is no center to my life now
No grace in my heart
Man from Mars
This time you went too far

I call and call
The silence is so full of sounds
You're in them all
I hear you in the water
And the wiring in the walls
Man from Mars
This time you went too far

"Love Puts On A New Face"

He said "You think you're a lady 
But I know you're a woman
We are as young as the night"
I said "No telephones ringing
No company coming
Just the lap of the lake and the firelight"
And the lonely loon and the crescent moon
What a pocket of heavenly grace
But in France they say
Everyday
Love puts on a new face
Love has many faces

About a month or so later he said
"Why can't you be happy
You make me feel helpless when you get this way"
I said "I'm up to my neck in alligators
Jaws gnashing at me
Each one trying to pull a piece away"
Darling, you can't slay these beasts of prey
Some bad dreams even love can't erase
But in France they say
Everyday
Love puts on a new face
Love has many faces

He wrote "I wish you were with me here
The leaves are electric
They burn on the river bank
Countless heatless flames"
I said "Send me some pictures then 
And I'll paint pyrotechnic
Explosions of your autumn till we meet again
I miss your touch and your lips so much
I long for our next embrace"
But in France they say
Everyday 
Love puts on a new face
Love puts on a new face
Love has many faces
Many many faces

"Lead Balloon"

"Kiss my ass" I said
And I threw my drink
Tequila trickling 
Down his business suit
Must be the Irish blood
Fight before you think
Turn it now
You can't cowtow
You can't undo it

It's his town
And that went down
Like a lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon
He said "Sic her, Rover"
That went over 
Like a lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon
Lead balloon

An angry man is just an angry man
But an angry woman
Bitch
I had to ask him for a helping hand
It came with the heart
Of a Bonaparte
Of a frozen fish

It's his town
And that went down
Like a lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon
He said "Sic her, Rover"
That went over
Like a lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon
Lead balloon

Lead balloon, lead lead lead lead balloon
Lead balloon, lead lead lead lead balloon
Lead balloon, lead lead lead lead balloon
Lead balloon

It's his town
And that went down
Like a lead balloon
Lead lead lead balloon
He said "Sic her, Rover"
That went over
Like a lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon
Lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon
Lead lead lead lead balloon
Lead balloon

"No Apologies"

The general offered
No apologies
He said "The soldiers erred in judgement
They should have hired a hooker"
No apologies
to the outraged Japanese
No "Sorry little girl"
The pigs just took her

Tire skids and teethmarks
What happened to this place
Lawyers and loan sharks 
Are laying America to waste

Freddie said that Juan thinks, I think
He's the devil
What a lofty title
For such a petty little tyrant
Bigger beasts abound
And they kick this world around
At this crazy speed
With violence and greed

Tire skids and teethmarks
What happened to this place
Lawyers and loan sharks
Are laying America to waste

So what makes a man a man
In these tough times
As druglords buy up the banks
And warlords radiate the oceans
Ecosystems fail
Snakes and snails and puppy tails
Are wagging in the womb
Beneath the trampled moon

Tire skids and teethmarks
What happened to this place
Lawyers and loan sharks
Are laying America to waste

The general offered
No apologies

"Taming The Tiger"

I stepped outside to breathe the air
And stare up at the stars
Big dipper hanging there
Over the rent-a-car
Over the rent-a-car
I'm a runaway from the record biz
From the hoods in the hood and the whiny white kids

Boring
The old man is snoring
And I'm taming the tiger
(You can't tame the tiger)
Tiger, tiger burning bright
Nice, kitty kitty
Tiger, tiger burning bright

Sophia says "It's hard to catch
And harder still to ride
The time to watch the beast the best
Is when it's purring at your side"
Purring at your side
Accolades and honors
One false move and you're a goner

Boring
The old man is snoring
And I'm taming the tiger
(You can't tame the tiger)
Tiger, tiger burning bright
Nice, kitty kitty
Tiger, tiger burning bright
In the forest of the night

The moon shed light
On my hopeless plight
As the radio blared so bland
Every disc, a poker chip
Every song just a one night stand
Formula music, girly guile
Genuine junk food for juveniles
Up and down the dial
Mercenary style

I watched the stars chuck down their spears
And a plane went blinking by
And I thought of Anna
Wild and dear
Like fireworks in the sky
Fireworks in the sky
I'm so sick of this game
It's hip, it's hot
Life's too short, the whole thing's gotten

Boring
The old man is snoring
And I'm taming the tiger
(You can't tame the tiger)
Tiger, tiger burning bright
Nice, kitty kitty

(Boring)
Tiger, tiger burning bright
(You can't tame the tiger)
Oh, be nice, kitty kitty
(Boring)
Tiger, tiger burning bright
Nice, kitty kitty
(Boring, boring)
Tiger, tiger burning bright
(Fight to the light, fight to the light)
In the forest of the night

"The Crazy Cries Of Love"

It was a dark and a stormy night
Everyone was at the wing-ding
They weren't the wing-ding type
So they went up on the train bridge 
Where the weather was howling
And oh, oh, my my
When that train comes rolling by
No paper thin walls, no folks above 
No one else can hear 
The crazy cries of love

They were laughing, they were dancing in the rain
They knew their love was a strong one
When they heard the far off whistle of a train
They were hoping it was going to be a long one
Cuz oh, oh, my my
When that train comes rolling by
No paper thin walls, no folks above
No one else can hear
The crazy cries of love

In the back booth of an all night cafe
Two dripping raincoats are hanging
Outside in the weather 
The shade on the streetlight is clanging
And they smile ear to ear and eye to eye
Ice cream is melting on a piece of pie
Oh, my my
No one else can hear
The cries of love

Every kiss was sweet and strong
Every touch was totally tandem
As the train come a-rumbling along
They sang a lover's song of wild abandon
And oh, oh, my my
When that train comes rolling by
No paper thin walls, no folks above
No one else can hear 
The crazy cries of love 
No paper thin walls, no folks above
No one else can hear
The crazy cries of love

"Stay In Touch"

This is really something
People will be envious
But our roles aren't clear
So we musn't rush
Still, we're burning brightly
Clinging like fire to fuel
I'm grinning like a fool
Stay in touch
We should stay in touch
Oh Stay in touch
In touch

Part of this is permanent
Part of this is passing
So we must be loyal and wary
Not to give away too much
Til we build a firm foundation
And empty out old habits
Old habits
Stay in touch
We should stay in touch
Oh Stay in touch
In touch

During times like these
The wise are influential
They can bear the imperfections
They can keep the harmony
No doubt about it
No doubt that's essential
No doubt that's always been a tricky one for me
So, we should just surrender
Let fate and duty shape us 
Let light hearts remake us
Let the worries hush
In the middle of this continent
In the middle of our time on Earth
We perceive one another
Stay in touch
We should stay in touch
Oh Stay in touch
In touch

"Face Lift"

I went so numb on Christmas day
I couldn't feel my hands or feet
I shouldn't have come
She made me pay
For gleaming with Donald down her street
She put blame on him
And shame on me
She made it all seem so tawdry and cheap
"Oh, let's be nice, Mama, open up your gifts
You know, happiness is the best facelift"

I mean, after all, she introduced us
Oh, but she regrets that now
Shacked up downtown 
Making love without a license
Same old sacred cow
She said, "Did you come home to disgrace us"
I said, "Why is this joy not allowed
For God's sake, I'm middle-aged, Mama
And time moves swift 
And you know happiness is the best facelift"

Oh, love takes so much courage
Love takes so much shit
She said "You've seen too many movies, Joni"
She said "Snap out of it"
Oh, the cold winds blew at our room with a view
All helpful and hopeful and candlelit
We kissed the angels and the moon eclipsed
You know, Happiness is the best facelift

We pushed the bed up to the window 
To see the Christmas lights
On the east bank across the steaming river
Between the bridges lit up Paris-like
This river has run through both our lives
Between these banks of our continuing delights
Bless us, don't let us lose the drift
You know, Happiness is the best facelift.

"My Best To You"

So here's to you
May your dreams come true
May old father time
Never be unkind
And through the years
Save your smiles and your tears
They're just souvenirs
They'll make music in your heart
Remember this
Each new day is a kiss
Sent from up above 
With an angel's love
So here's to you
May your skies be blue
And your love blessed
That's my best to you

Remember this
Each new day is a kiss
Sent from up above 
With an angel's love
So here's to you
May your skies be blue
And your love blessed
That's my very best to you

"You're My Thrill"

You're my thrill
You do something to me
You send chills right through me
When I look at you
'Cause you're my thrill

You're my thrill
How my pulse increases
I just go to pieces
Every time I look at you
I can't keep still

Nothing seems to matter
Here's my heart on a silver platter
Oh where is my will
Why this strange desire
Flaming higher and higher
Every time I look at you
I can't keep still
You're my thrill

Oh where's my will
Why this strange desire
Flaming higher and higher
Every time I look at you
I can't keep still
Oh you're my thrill

"At Last"

At last
My love has come along
My lonely days are over
And life is like a lovely song

At last
The skies above are blue
My heart's wrapped up in clover
Ever since the night I looked at you

I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill like I have never known

When you smile
When you smile at me
That's how the spell was cast
And now here we are in heaven
I found my love at last

I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream to call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill like I had never known

Oh when you smile
When you smile at me
That's how the spell was cast
And now here we are in heaven
I found my love at last
At last

"Comes Love"

Comes a rain storm
Put your rubbers on your feet
Comes a snow storm
You can get a little heat
Comes love
Nothing can be done

Comes a fire
Firemen come and rescue you
Blow a tire
You can patch the inner tube
Comes love
Nothing can be done

Don't try hidin'
'Cause it isn't any use
You'll just start slidin'
When your heart turns on the juice

Comes a heat wave
You can hurry to the shore
Comes a summons
Hide yourself behind a door
Comes love
Nothing can be done

Comes a headache
You can lose it in a day
Comes a toothache
See your dentist right away
Comes love
Nothing can be done

Comes the measles
You can quarantine the room
Comes a mousie
You can chase it with a broom
Comes love
Nothing can be done

That's all brother
If you've ever been in love
That's all brother
And you know just what I'm speakin' of

Comes a nightmare
You can always stay awake
Comes depression
You could get another break
Comes love
Nothing can be done
Nothing can be done

"You've Changed"

You've changed
The sparkle in your eyes is gone
Your smile is just a careless yawn
You're breaking my heart
You've changed

You've changed
Your kisses now are so blas
You're bored with me in every way
I can't understand
You've changed

You've forgotten the words I love you
And the memories that we've shared
You've ignored all the stars up above you
I can't realize that you ever cared
You've changed

You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me, I know we're through
It's all over now
You've changed

You've forgotten the words I love you
And the memories that we've shared
You ignore all the stars up above you
I can't realize that you ever cared
You've changed

You're not the angel I once knew
No need to tell me, I know we're through
It's all over now
You've changed

"Answer Me, My Love"

Answer me
Oh my love
Just what sin have I been guilty of
Tell me how I came to lose your love
Please answer me sweetheart

You were mine yesterday
I believed that love was here to stay
Won't you tell me how I've gone astray
Please answer me my love

If you're happier without me
I'll try not to care
But if you still think about me
Please listen to my prayer

You must know that I've been true
Won't you say that we can start anew
In my sorrow now I turn to you
Please answer me my love

If you're happier without me
I'll try not to care
But if you still think about me
Please listen to my prayer

You must know that I've been true
Won't you say that we can start anew
In my sorrow now I turn to you
Please answer me my love
Answer me my love

"A Case Of You"

Just before our love got lost you said
"I am as constant as a northern star"
And I said, "Constantly in the darkness
Where's that at
If you want me I'll be in the bar"

On the back of a cartoon coaster
In the blue TV-screen light
I drew a map of Canada
Oh, Canada
And I sketched your face on it twice

Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine
Oh and you taste so bitter but you taste so sweet
Oh, I could drink a case of you
I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I'd still be on my feet

Oh, I am a lonely painter
I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid

I remember that time that you told me
You said, "Love is touching souls"
Surely you touched mine
'Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time

Oh, you're in my blood like holy wine
And you taste so bitter and you taste so sweet
I could drink a case of you
I could drink a case of you, darling
Still I'd be on my feet
I'd still be on my feet

I met a woman
She had a mouth like yours
She knew your life
She knew your devils and your deeds
And she said, "Go to him, stay with him if you can
But be prepared to bleed"

Oh, but you are in my blood
You're my holy wine
Oh, and you taste so bitter but you taste so sweet
I could drink a case of you darling
And still I'd be on my feet
Still I'd be on my feet

"Don't Go To Strangers"

Build your dreams
To the stars above
But when you need someone true to love
Don't go to strangers
Lover come to me

Play with fire
Get your fingers burned
But when there's no place left to turn
Don't go to strangers
Lover come to me

You give the call to follow your heart
You'll follow your heart, I know
I've been around
I'm an old hand
I'll understand if you have to go

So make your mark
For your friends to see
But when you need more than company
Don't go to strangers
Lover come to me

Don't go to strangers
Lover come to me

"Sometimes I'm Happy"

Sometimes I'm happy
Sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
As long as I have the sun in your eyes

Sometimes I love you
Sometimes I hate you
When I hate you
It's because I love you
That's how I am
So what can I do
I'm happy when I'm with you

Sometimes I'm happy
Sometimes I'm blue
My disposition depends on you
I never mind the rain from the skies
As long as I have the sun in your eyes

Sometimes I love you
Sometimes I hate you
When I hate you
It's because I love you
That's how I am
So what can I do
I'm happy when I'm with you

I'm happy when I'm with you
I'm happy when I'm with you
I'm happy when I'm with you
I'm happy when I'm with you

"Don't Worry 'Bout Me"

Don't worry 'bout me
I'll get along
Forget about me
Just be happy my love

Let's say that our little show is over
And so the story ends
Why not call it a day the sensible way
And still be friends

Look out for yourself
That should be the rule
Give your heart and your love
To whomever you love
Darlin' don't be a fool

Why do we cling to this old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then don't worry 'bout me

Why should we cling to some old faded thing
That used to be
So if you can forget
Then you don't worry 'bout me

"Stormy Weather"

Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all of the time

Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor self together
I'm weary all the time
All the time

So weary all of the time
When you went away
The blues stepped up and met me
If he's gone to stay
That old rocking chair's going to get me
Every night I pray
That the Lord above will let me
Walk in the sunlight once more

I can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all of the time

Keeps rainin' all of the time

"I Wish I Were In Love Again"

The sleepless nights
The daily fights
The quick toboggan when you reach the heights
I miss the kisses and I miss the bites
I wish I were in love again

The broken dates
The endless waits
The lovely loving and the hateful hates
The conversations with the flying plates
I wish I were in love again

No more pain
No no more strain
Now I'm sane
But I'd rather be punch drunk

The flying fur of cat and cur
The fine mismatching of a him and her
I've learned my lesson but
I wish I were in love again

The furtive sigh
The blackened eye
The words I love you 'til the day I die
The self-deception that believes that lie
I wish I were in love again

When love congeals
It soon reveals
The faint aroma of performing seals
The double-crossing of a pair of heels
I wish I were in love again

No more care
No more despair
Now I'm all there
But I'd rather be punch drunk

Believe me sir, I much prefer
The classic battle of a him and her
I don't like quiet and I wish I were
In love again
In love again

"Both Sides Now"

Rows and floes of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way

But now they only block the sun
They rain and they snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all

Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way that you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions that I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say "I love you" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way

Oh, but now old friends they're acting strange
And they shake their heads and they tell me that I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day

I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow
It's life's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

It's life's illusions that I recall
I really don't know life 
I really don't know life at all

"This Place"

Sparkle on the ocean
Eagle at the top of a tree
Those crazy crows always making a commotion
This land is home to me.

I was talking to my neighbor
He said, "When I get to heaven, if it is not like this,
I'll just hop a cloud and I'm coming right back down here
Back to this heavenly bliss."

You see those lovely hills
They won't be there for long
They're gonna tear 'em down
And sell them to California
Here come the toxic spills
Miners poking all around
When this place looks like a moonscape
Don't say I didn't warn ya...

Money, money, money...
Money makes the trees come down
It makes mountains into molehills
Big money kicks the wide wide world around.

Black bear in the orchard
At night he's in my garbage cans
He's getting so bold but no one wants to shoot him
He's got a right to roam this land.

I feel like Geronimo
I used to be as trusting as Cochise
But the white eyes lies
He's out of whack with nature
And look how far his weapons reach

Spirit of the water
Give us all the courage and the grace
To make genius of this tragedy unfolding
The genius to save this place.

"If I Had A Heart"

Holy war
Genocide
Suicide
Hate and cruelty...
How can this be holy
If I had a heart I'd cry.

These ancient tales...
The good go to heaven
And the wicked ones burn in hell...
Ring the funeral bells
If I had a heart I'd cry.

There's just too many people now
Too little land
Much too much desire
You feel so feeble now
It's so out of hand
Big bombs and barbed wire
We've set our lovely sky
Our lovely sky
On fire

There's just too many people now
And too little land
Too much rage and desire
It makes you feel so feeble now
It's so out of hand-
Big bombs and barbed wire...
Can't you see
Our destiny
We are making this Earth
Our funeral pyre

Holy Earth
How can we heal you
We cover you like a blight...
Strange birds of appetite...
If I had a heart I'd cry.
If I had a heart I'd cry.
If I had a heart I'd cry.

"Hana"

Hana steps out of a storm
Into a stranger's warm, but
Hard-up kitchen
She sees what must be done
So she takes off her coat
Rolls up her sleeves
And starts pitchin' in

Hana has a special knack
For getting people back on the right track
'Cause she knows
They all matter
So she doesn't argue or flatter
She doesn't fight the slights
She takes it on the chin
Like a champ

Hana says when life's a drag
Don't cave in
Don't put up a white flag
Raise up
A white banner
In this manner
Straighten your back
Dig in your heels
And get a good grip on your grief

Hana says, "Don't get me wrong
This is no simple Sunday song
Where God or Jesus comes along
And they save ya."
You've got to be braver than that
You tackle the beast alone
With all its tenacious teeth
Light the lamp

"Bad Dreams"

The cats are in the flower bed
A red hawk rides the sky
I guess I should be happy
Just to be alive...
But we have poisoned everything
And oblivious to it all
The cell phone zombies babble
Through the shopping malls
While condors fall from Indian skies
Whales beach and die in sand...
Bad dreams are good
In the great plan.

You cannot be trusted
Do you even know you're lying
It's dangerous to kid yourself
You go deaf and dumb and blind.
You take with such entitlement.
You give bad attitude.
You have no grace
No empathy
No gratitude

You have no sense of consequence
Oh my head is in my hands...
Bad dreams are good
In the great plan.

Before that altering apple
We were one with everything
No sense of self and other
No self-consciousness.
But now we have to grapple
With our man-made world backfiring
Keeping one eye on our brother's deadly selfishness.

And everyone's a victim
Nobody's hands are clean.
There's so very little left of wild Eden Earth
So near the jaws of our machines.
We live in these electric scabs.
These lesions once were lakes.
No one knows how to shoulder the blame
Or learn from past mistakes...
So who will come to save the day
Mighty Mouse
Superman
Bad dreams are good in the great plan.

"Big Yellow Taxi 2007"

So they paved paradise
And put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel
A boutique
And a swinging night spot.
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot.

They took all the trees
Put 'em in a tree museum
And they charged all the people
An arm and a leg just to see 'em
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot.

Hey farmer
Put away your DDT
Give me spots on my apples
But leave me the birds and bees
Please
Don't it always seem to go
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
And they put up a parking lot.

Late last night
I heard the screen door slam
And a big yellow taxi come and took away my old man.
Don't it always seem to go
You don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They paved paradise
Put up a parking lot.

"Night Of The Iguana"

The tour bus came yesterday
The driver's a mess today
It's a dump of a destiny
But it's got a view...
Now the kid in the see-through blouse
Is moving in hard on his holy vows...
Since the preacher's not dead
Dead drunk will have to do

Night of the iguana
The jasmine is so mercilessly sweet
Night of the iguana
Can you hear the castanets
The widow is dancing
Down on the beach

The starlight is steaming
He'd like to be dreaming
His senses are screaming
Not to be denied...
But if the spell of the night should win
He could lose his bus
For the same sweet sin
That took his church from him
Then how will he survive

Night of the iguana
The jasmine is so mercilessly sweet
Night of the iguana
Can you hear the castanets
It's the widow and her lover-boys
Down on the beach

The night is so fragrant
These women so flagrant
They could make him a vagrant
With the flick of a shawl.
The devil's in sweet sixteen
The widow's good looking but she gets mean
He's burning like Augustine
With no help from God at all

"Strong And Wrong"

Strong and wrong you win--
Only because
That's the way its always been.
Men love war
That's what history' s for.
History...
A mass--murder mystery...
His story

Strong and wrong
You lose everything
Without the heart
You need
To hear a robin sing
Where have all the songbirds gone
Gone
All I hear are crows in flight
Singing might is right
Might is right

Oh the dawn of man comes slow
Thousands of years
And here we are...
Still worshiping
Our own ego

Strong and wrong
What is God's will
Onward Christian soldiers...
Or thou shall not kill...
Men love war
Is that what God is for
Just a Rabbit's foot
Just a lucky paw
For shock and awe
Shock and awe

The dawn of man comes slow
Thousands of years
Here we are
Still worshiping
Our own ego
Strong and Wrong
Strong and Wrong

"Shine"

Oh let your little light shine
Let your little light shine
Shine on Vegas and Wall Street
Place your bets
Shine on the fishermen
With nothing in their nets
Shine on rising oceans and evaporating seas
Shine on our Frankenstein technologies
Shine on science
With its tunnel vision
Shine on fertile farmland
Buried under subdivisions

Let your little light shine
Let your little light shine
Shine on the dazzling darkness
That restores us in deep sleep
Shine on what we throw away
And what we keep

Shine on Reverend Pearson
Who threw away
The vain old God
Kept Dickens and Rembrandt and Beethoven
And fresh plowed sod
Shine on good earth, good air, good water
And a safe place
For kids to play
Shine on bombs exploding
Half a mile away

Let your little light shine
Let your little light shine
Shine on world-wide traffic jams
Honking day and night
Shine on another asshole
Passing on the right
Shine on the red light runners
Busy talking on their cell phones
Shine on the Catholic Church
And the prisons that it owns
Shine on all the Churches
They all love less and less
Shine on a hopeful girl
In a dreamy dress

Let your little light shine
Let your little light shine
Shine on good humor
Shine on good will
Shine on lousy leadership
Licensed to kill
Shine on dying soldiers
In patriotic pain
Shine on mass destruction
In some God's name
Shine on the pioneers
Those seekers of mental health
Craving simplicity
They traveled inward
Past themselves
May all their little lights shine

"If"

If you can keep your head
While all about you
People are losing theirs and blaming you
If you can trust yourself
When everybody doubts you
And make allowance for their doubting too

If you can wait
And not get tired of waiting
And when lied about
Stand tall
Don't deal in lies
And when hated
Don't give in to hating back
Don't need to look so good
Don't need to talk too wise

If you can dream
And not make dreams your master
If you can think
And not make intellect your game
If you can meet
With triumph and disaster
And treat those two imposters just the same

If you can force your heart
And nerve and sinew
To serve you
After all of them are gone
And so hold on
When there is nothing in you
Nothing but the will
That's telling you to hold on
Hold on

If you can bear to hear
The truth you've spoken
Twisted and misconstrued
By some smug fool
Or watch your life's work
Torn apart and broken down
And still stoop to build again
With worn out tools

If you can draw a crowd
And keep your virtue
Or walk with Kings
And keep the common touch
If neither enemies nor loving friends
Can hurt you
If everybody counts with you
But none too much

If you can fill the journey
Of a minute
With sixty seconds worth of wonder and delight
Then
The Earth is yours
And everything that's in it
But more than that
I know
You'll be alright
You'll be alright

Cause you've got the fight
You've got the insight
You've got the fight
You've got the insight

"A Melody In Your Name"

Can you still remember how it all began
With clipper ships and pink electric trees
Dawnlight on a skyline bridges' span
Street light on a rooftop memory
Then it was me and spring came
Playing a song of spring rain
A melody in your name
Night now comes much bluer than it used to be
The pink nun sings much sadder than before
She sings that sometimes things aren't what they
Seem to be, like moons reflected on the sixteenth floor
Love is no more, it's ended
Paper and pins won't mend it
Even the moon pretended
There must be a reason, oh, there must be one
Keep your answers, let me find my own
Where do pretty stories get their endings from
If loving always leaves you all alone
Kisses have shown me sorrow
Love is a throne to borrow
Pay for the loan tomorrow

"Anathea"

Laszlo Thea stole a stallion
Stole him from the misty mountains
And they chased him and they caught him
And in iron chains they bound him

Word was sent to Ana Thea
That her brother was in prison
Bring me gold and six fine horses
I will buy my brother's freedom

Judge, oh, judge, please spare my brother
I will give you gold and silver
I don't want your gold and silver
All I want are your sweet favors

Ana Thea, oh my sister
Are you mad with grief and sorrow
He will rob you of your flower
And he'll hang me from the gallows

Ana Thea did not listen
Straight way to the judge went running
In his golden bed at midnight
There she heard the gallows groaning

Curses be that judge so cruel
Thirteen years may he lie bleeding
Thirteen doctors cannot cure him
Thirteen shelves of drugs can't heal him

Ana Thea, Ana Thea
Don't go out into the forest
There among the green pines standing
You will find your brother hanging

"Blue on Blue"

Blue on blue
Sky's in your eyes
Steer you away like I wasn't here
Where do you go when you fantasize
Bet you wish I'd disappear
Leave you to dreaming and leave you alone
Lost in a world that's all your own
Can I come, too
Blue on blue

Dreams like you are making now
Are very hard to share
All I ask is one small favor
Dream a dream and wish me there

Gold on gold, sun in your hair
Spinning the rainbow, weaving the wind
Bluing the dye for the midnight air
Counting the gold at the rainbows end
Rapier princess whispers your name
Out of the time before I came
I'll never know
Gold on gold

Dreams like you are making now
Are very hard to share
All I ask is one small favor
Dream a dream and wish me there

Blue on blue

"Cara's Castle"

If you ever come to our town
On a carousel crusade
And you're tired of fighting windmills with a nail
Cross the fence and join the dragons
Who have never made the grade
Cara's castle and the keepers of a most unholy grail

Oh Cara, Queen of the losers, ruler of the weak
Give the poet what he chooses till he's too dumb to speak

There's a clock upon the mantle
But its hands forget the time
And the windows turn their backs upon the day
And the people in the shadows
Could be all lost friends of mine
Cara's courtiers need no light need no light to lose their way

Oh Cara, Queen of the losers, ruler of the weak
Give the poet what he chooses till he's too dumb to speak

From the end to the beginning
Crippled minds retrace the steps
From the burial to the birth they do retreat
Wonderin' where and when and why
Their souls were slaughtered while they slept
Cara's courtiers know no victory know no victory just defeat

Oh Cara, Queen of the losers, ruler of the weak
Give the poet what he chooses till he's too dumb to speak

One by one the battered soldiers
Go slowly cross the moat
One by one they seek new castles somewhere else
With their crutches and the cravens
And I wonder is there hope
Is there hope for Cara's courtiers and the wars against themselves

Oh Cara, Queen of the losers, ruler of the weak
Give the poet what he chooses till he's too dumb to speak

"Circle Game"

Yesterday a child came out to wonder
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder
And tearful at the falling of a star

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

Then the child moved ten times round the seasons
Skated over ten clear frozen streams
Words like when you're older must appease him
And promises of someday make his dreams

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now
Cartwheels turn to car wheels thru the town
And they tell him take your time it won't be long now
Till you drag your feet to slow the circles down

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true
There'll be new dreams maybe better dreams and plenty
Before the last revolving year is through

And the seasons they go round and round
And the painted ponies go up and down
We're captive on the carousel of time
We can't return we can only look
Behind from where we came
And go round and round and round
In the circle game
And go round and round and round
In the circle game

"Copper Kettle"

Get you a copper kettle
Get you a copper coil
Cover with new-made corn mash
And never more you'll toil

You'll just lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-fillin'
In the pale moonlight

Get you a fire of hickory
Get you a fire of oak
Don't use no green or rotten wood
They'll find you by the smoke

While you lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-fillin'
In the pale moonlight

My grandpappy he made whiskey
My daddy he made it too
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792

We just lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-fillin'
In the pale moonlight

Get you a copper kettle
Get you a copper coil
Cover with new-made corn mash
And never more you will toil

You'll just lay there by the juniper
While the moon is bright
Watch them jugs a-fillin'
In the pale moonlight

"Day After Day"

Day after day
Miles and miles of railroad track
Night after night
Hummin' of the wheels
Their hummin' seems to say
He'll follow you someday
But someday seems a million miles away
Wish I could turn around
And run back home again
I've had no mercy
Since the blues got on this train

Day after day
Make a dollar, need it twice
Night after night
Lie awake and dream
Of days of auld lang syne
Moonlight through the pine
And linen table cloths all stained with wine
Wish I could turn around
And run back home again
I've been so empty
Since I caught that eastbound train

Day after day
Watch the hands move 'round the clock
Night after night
Searching for my soul
So this must be my fate
To sit and weep and wait
And pray my darlin' comes before too late
Wish I could turn around
And run back home again
I've been so lonely
Since I caught that eastbound train

"Dr. Junk"

Dr. Junk the Dentist Man
Fills your teeth with what he can
Airplane wings and corset stays
And when he's done he'll let you pay
In paper clips or inner tubes
Or anything that's slightly used
He's not really crazy
Only nuts and bolts
And rusty rings make him do
The strangest things

Dr. Junk the Dentist has
An office full of colored glass
A garden with a paddle wheel
And funny plants for eye appeal
And though he watches them with care
I've never seen them growing there
He's not really crazy
Only nuts and bolts
And rusty rings make him do
Eccentric things

Dr. Junk the Dentist built
A junky castle up on stilts
Junk within and junk throughout
And TV in the chimney spout
And fourteen levels to each floor
And now he's adding fourteen more
He's not really crazy
Only nuts and bolts
And rusty rings make him do
The strangest things

"Eastern Rain"

Rain comes from the east one night
We watch it come
To hang like beaded curtains
Till the morning sun
Water dripping from our clothes
You with raindrops on your nose
Ask me sadly "Please don't go away now"
Till the rain is done, I say
"I'll stay now"

Rain outside but inside we don't mind at all
Shadows by the fire slowly climb and fall
Kisses fade and leave no trace
Whispers vanish into space
The dawn will send me on a chase to nowhere
Why cry as if I were the first to go there

And I know I shouldn't be here
Yes, I know I should go home
But that eastern rain drones in my brain
And I'm so all alone, so all alone

Morning comes up from the east
We watch it come
And far away now rolls the ancient rain God's drum
You with daybreak in your eyes
Afraid to speak for telling lies
I watch you search for some reply to lend me
But when the rain is done
There's no pretending

And I know I shouldn't be here
Yes, I know I should go home
But that eastern rain drones in my brain
And I'm so all alone, so all alone

"Fare Thee Well (Dink's Song)"

If I had wings like Noah's dove
I'd fly that river to the one I love
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

I've got a man, and he's long and tall
Moves his body like a cannon ball
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

They gave me a new man to share my bed
Sometimes I wish that I was dead
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

One of these mornings I know he's gonna set me free
There'll be no more auction block for me
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

Yes one of these mornings and it won't be long
Them white bosses gonna find me gone
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well
Fare thee well, oh honey, fare thee well

"Favorite Colour"

I met a child a year ago
Whose eyes would never see
She asked me with a timid smile
"What colour is a tree"

"In summertime a tree is green
In autumn gold and red
In winter they are frosted white
When all their leaves are shed."

"I know the sky is blue," she said
"And silver is the sand
And apples are the brightest red
What colour is a man"

"Man is many colours child
Some are yellow, some are brown
And some are black as sightlessness
Some white as eiderdown."

She took her crayons from a box
And placed them in my glove
And said, "By mixing all of these
Comes my favourite colour - love."

"Gemini Twin"

Write me a royal blue parchment poem
Draw me a royal blue lady like me
Draw me a smile
That's a lot like my own
And make my eyes flowers
And make my mind see
I will weave melodies only for you
And color them silver and saffron and blue

Build me a window to watch everything
Leave it unshuttered so nothing slips by
No season, no sorrow, no wonderful thing
No raspberry, strawberry sun in the sky
I will bring music and marsipan bars
And live deep inside you
Wherever you are

Teach me the ways of the Gemini twin
Show me the love that he says without words
Bring me his laughter again and again
The silence is singing, the quiet is heard
I will find harmonies waiting unsung
With two souls to sing them
Where once there was one

"Here Today And Gone Tomorrow"

Love is not a game with me
Played with inconsistency
Though my love turned out to be
Here today and gone tomorrow

Love is like a candlelight
Sometimes flickering sometimes bright
Sometimes burning up the night
Here today and gone tomorrow

Love is something of a rover
Comes to town and takes a lover
Packs his bag and then it's over
Here today and gone tomorrow

Love's a field of sugar cane
Sunshine smiles and teardrop rain
Feed it till it's cut again
Here today and gone tomorrow

Love's a rainbow in the sky
None can reach it, still they try
Rainbow chasing fool am I
Here today and gone tomorrow

Love must be the birds in spring
Only lovers hear them sing
All too soon they're on the wing
Here today and gone tomorrow

No love is not a game with me
Played with inconsistency
Though my love turned out to be
Here today and gone tomorrow

"House Of The Rising Sun"

There is a house in New Orleans
They call The Rising Sun
It's been the ruin of many a poor girl
And me, oh God, for one

If I had listened to what my mama said
I'd be at home today
But I was young and foolish, poor girl
Let a gambler lead me astray

My mother, she's a tailor
She sews those old blue jeans
My father, he's a gamblin' man
Drinks down in New Orleans

Go tell my baby sister
Not to do as I have done
You shun that house in New Orleans
They call it The Rising Sun

Well, I'm going back to New Orleans
My race is almost run
I'm going to spend the rest of my days
Beneath that Rising Sun

Well, one foot is on the platform
And the other one's on the train
I'm going to spend the rest of my days
Wearing that ball and chain

"Hunter"

I was alone and sickly
It was a quarter of a moonlit night
I heard him cry through my window shade
And it filled me so full of fright
But I could not turn my back on him
I put on the back porch light
"Can I help you" said the Good Samaritan
"Can I help you" said the Good Samaritan

I brought him bread and a blanket
But I told him "You can't come in"
You can sleep outside in the tool shed
Though a little rain comes in
Oh, I don't know you, you're a stranger
I don't know where you've been
"You can't come in here" said the keeper of the inn
"I don't want you in here," said the keeper of the inn

But I couldn't sleep for the thinking
You know my night got so insane
I thought, maybe he was an angel
And I left him out in the rain
And what if he was the devil
He'd be coming after me again
But when I woke in the weary morning he was gone
When I woke in the weary morning he was gone

I thought maybe he was an angel
And I left him out in the rain
And what if he was the devil
He'd be coming after me again
When I woke in the weary morning he was gone
When I woke in the weary morning, Lord, he was gone

"John Hardy"

John Hardy was a fightin' man
Carried a razor everyday
Well he killed a man in Mobile town
You ought to see my Johnny get away
Ought to see my Johnny get away

Well get away, get away
Poor John, poor John

John Hardy was standin' at the bar
So drunk he could not see
Along came a man with a warrant in his hand
Cryin' Johnny boy why don't you come with me
Johnny boy why don't you come with me

Well get away, get away
Poor John, poor John

John Hardy had a pretty little girl
Kept her dressed in blue
Saw her in the hangin' crowd
Cryin' Johnny boy I'll be true to you
Johnny boy I'll be true to you

Well get away, get away
Poor John, poor John

I've been to the north and I've been to the south
Been this whole world 'round
Well I've lived in the east and I've lived in the west
And this will be my buryin' ground
This will be my buryin' ground

Yes I've been this wild world over
Yes I've been this whole world 'round
And I've been to the river
And I've been baptized
Take me to my buryin' grounds

Well get away, get away
Poor John, poor John, poor John

"Let It Be Me"

Old Mister Wind - hear him howl
Even the moon seems to scowl
Even the skies seem to sympathize
As they weep into
Their leafy cryin' towel

I didn't sleep last night
Room is gettin' light
That old sun I see
Just arisin' here for me
Will be settin' someplace else
For you tonight

You're a rambler a rover
You've been this wild world over
All you ask of life is to be free
When those boots I've been lickin'
Feel a little more like stickin'
Please let it be here and let it be me

Maybe if the day you left this town
I'd acted more the lover less the clown
Maybe if I'd cried those tears I'd learn to hide
I'd be with you on that road you're fadin' down

You're a rambler a rover
You've been this wild world over
All you ask of life is to be free
When those boots I've been lickin'
Feel a little more like stickin'
Please let it be here and let it be me
Please let it be here and let it be me

"Like The Lonely Swallow"

Kiss me on a Sunday
A hop and skip and run day
And though he left on Monday
His kiss stayed lingering

In the days to follow
My heart became a hollow
And like the lonely swallow
I've but one song to sing
Of happy sorrow only love can bring

Letter came on Tuesday
Goodbye to those blues days
He asked me that good new day
To catch the Wednesday train

Hands of clock are lagging
Hours pass a dragging
Warning tongues are wagging
You'll break your heart again
But I know this love
Would never bring me pain

Often while we wander
My love and I do ponder
Which of us is fonder
Of the new love each has found

I say he's the baker
The makes the wonder awaken
Take the refuge that she's seekin
From the stormy world around
And forget the lonely places
She was bound

"Like Veils Said Lorriane"

"It's the veils you tear off one by one," said Lorraine
"No, it's walls we put up," said that tired voice again
The chisel gets blunt and the sword gets profane
Nobody's blame
But you bind up the stone chips in the gauze that you've slain

You get so discouraged trying to cut thru it all
More veils beyond veils, always walls behind the walls
"Get back in there" yells the golden glove
"When you gonna trust me," slams the friend
"Learn how to bend"
"Don't you worry now," soothes the sweet lover with his medicine hands

Oh, I don't want to grow narrow and foolish in old age
And miss all that beauty, the wisdom and the grace
And you know you don't get that from high finance or fame
If you get stuck in that frame
Or the paint that you can put on your face and your name

"Love Or Money"

The firmament of Tinsel Town
Is strung with tungsten stars
Lot's of forty watt successes
He says where's my own shining hour
He's the well kept secret of the underground
He's in debt to the company store
Because his only channelled aspiration
Was getting back that girl he had before
He's got stacks and stacks of words that rhyme
Describing what it is to lose
He's got some just for laughs
He's got some for love
That mainline to his blues
Some to shed a little light on you and on me
Some to shed a little light on the human story

The wars of pride and property
The rebel Irish and the promised land Jew
Fighting behind his eyes and over seas
Wounded in action and no ceasefire in view
Brave reporters bring the battles home
But tonight inside that box
Just more bang bang ketchup color to him
Just more Twentieth Century Fox
All because that ghostly girl comes haunting
Just out of reach-outside his bed
And she kicks the covers off his sleep
For the clumsy things he said
She commands his head-She tries his sanity
She demands his head-Tonight unknowingly

Vaguely she floats and lacelike
Blown in like a curtain on the night wind
She's nebulous and naked
He wonders where she's been
He grabs at the air because there's nothing there
Her evasiveness stings him
With long legs-long lonely legs
Bruised from banging into things
One day he was standing just outside her door
He was carrying an armload of bright balloons
She just laughed
She said she heard him knocking
And she teased him for the moon
"Is one the moon, dear clown,
Tied to a string for me"
He tried but he could not get it down
For truth or for mystery
He tried but he could not get it down
For love or money

"Me And My Uncle"

Me and my uncle went ridin' down
From Colorado, west Texas bound
And we stopped off in Santa Fe
It bein' the place about half way
And besides it was the hottest part of the day

We led our ponies into a stall
Went to the bar, boys, bought drinks for all
Two days in the saddle, my body hurt
It being summer, took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

West Texas cowboys, all over town
With gold and silver, they're loaded down
Just in from roundup, it seemed a shame
And so my uncle starts a friendly game
Now it's hollow jack and winner take the game

From the beginning, uncle starts to win
Them Texas cowboys, they was mad as sin
Some say he's cheatin', that can't be
'Cause my uncle, he's as honest as me
And I'm as honest as a Denver gal can be

One Texas cowboy, he starts to draw
I grabbed a bottle, slapped him on the jaw
I shot another, he won't grow old
In the confusion, uncle grabbed the gold
And we hightailed it down to Mexico

Now God bless cowboys, and God bless gold
God bless my uncle, and rest his soul
He taught me well boys, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, boys, I grabbed that gold
And I left him lyin' there, I left him lyin' there
I left him lyin' there by the side of the road

"Molly Malone"

In Dublin's fair city
Where girls are so pretty
It was there that I first met sweet Molly Malone
She wheeled her wheelbarrow
Through the streets broad and narrow
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"

Alive, alive, oh
Alive, alive, oh
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"

Now she was a fishmonger
And sure, t'was no wonder
For her father and mother
Were fishmongers too
And they both wheeled their barrow
Through the streets broad and narrow
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"

Alive, alive, oh
Alive, alive, oh
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"

Now she died of a fever
And no one could save her
Was then that I lost sweet Molly Malone
Now her ghost wheels her barrow
Through streets broad and narrow
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"

Alive, alive, oh
Alive, alive, oh
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"

"Nancy Whiskey"

I am a weaver a Calton Weaver
I am a rash and a rovin' blade
I've got silver in my pooches
I'll gang follow the weaver's trade
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

Now I rolled into Glasgow City
Nancy Whisky I chanced to smell
I went in, sat doon beside her
Seven long years I loved her well
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

Now the more I kissed her the more I loved her
The more I kissed her the more she smiled
I set forth on my mother's teachin'
Nancy soon had me beguiled
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

Now I rose the early morning
To quench my thirst it was my need
I tried to rise but I was not able
Nancy had me by the heid
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

Now I'm going back to the Calton weaving
I'll surely make those shuttles fly
I'll earn more at the Calton weavin
Than that I did in days gone by
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

So come all you weavers, ye Calton Weavers
Come all you weavers where e're you be
Beware of Whisky Nancy Whisky
She'll ruin you as she ruined me
Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

Whisky, Whisky, Nancy Whisky
Whisky, Whisky Nancy-o

"Passion Play (The Story Of Jesus And achius...The Little Tax Collector)"

Magdalene is trembling
Like a washing on a line
Trembling and gleaming
Never before was a man so kind
Never so redeeming

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue
In radiation rose
Ecstasy
Now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free
(Who're you gonna get)

I am up a sycamore
Looking through the leaves
A sinner of some position
Who in the world can this heart healer be
This magical physician

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue
In radiation rose
Misery
Now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free
(Who're you gonna get)

Enter the multitudes
The walking wounded
They come to this diver of the heart
of the multitudes
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done

Oh climb down climb down he says to me
From the middle of unrest
They think his light is squandered
But he sees a stray in the wilderness
And I see how far I've wandered

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue
In radiation rose
Apathy
Now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free

Enter the multitudes
The walking wounded
They come to this diver of the heart
of the multitudes
Thy kingdom come

Oh all around the marketplace
The buzzing of the flies
The buzzing and the stinging
Divinely barren
And wickedly wise
The killer nails are ringing

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue
In radiation rose
Tragedy
Now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free
(Who're you gonna get)

"Pat's Solo"

This is my solo...
Excuse me Sir...would you please take your seat,
I'm playing my solo... no I'm serious can't you see I'm playing a solo here...
Hey buddy sit down so I can concentrate on my solo....
Ok that's it, you would think that an artist could play a solo once in a while without any interuptions. Here...you take my guitar and show us what is so important...
What You work here, you're the usher
Oooook, sorry, soooo I'll just play my solo then.

"Real Good for Free"

I slept last night in a good hotel
I went shopping today for jewels
The wind rushed around in the dirty town
And the children let out from the schools
I was standing on a noisy corner
Waiting for the walking green
Across the street he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet, for free.

Now me I play for fortune
And those velvet curtain calls
I've got a black limousine
And two gentlemen
Escorting me to the halls
And I play if you have the money

Or if you're a friend to me
But the one man band
By the quick lunch stand
He was playing real good, for free.

Nobody stopped to hear him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never
Been on their t.v.
So they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony...
I heard his refrain
As the signal changed
He was playing real good, for free.

"Sad Winds Blowin'"

Gone, just as lonely as before
There's his smoke against the ceiling
And his ashes on the floor
Gone golden genie in the blaze of a thousand sorries
Ashes and smoke are all that's staying
They'll soon be going
With the sad winds blowin'

Dark, strike a match and light a candle
Candles always look so hopeful
But it's more than I can handle

Dark, strike a match and light a candle
Candles always look so hopeful
But it's more than I can handle
Cry for a river from the sun
It's just as easy
Flame on the candle's almost done
It'll soon be going
With the sad winds blowin'

Times, just a senseless lot of ticking
She's the master of our people

Ah, if that's good enough for you, I don't know

"Seven Daffodils"

I haven't got a mansion
Nor have I any land
Not one single dollar
To crinkle in my hand

But I can show you the morning, on a thousand hills
And kiss you, and give you seven daffodils

I haven't got a fortune
To buy you pretty things
But I can make you moonbeams
Into necklaces and rings

But I can show you the morning, on a thousand hills
And kiss you, and give you seven daffodils

Yes, seven pretty daffodils
Are shining in the sun
To light our way to evening
And when the day is done
I will give you kisses, three
And a crust of bread
And a pillow of piny boughs to rest your head

No I haven't got a mansion
Nor have I any land
Not one single dollar
To crinkle in my hands

But I can show you the morning, on a thousand hills
And kiss you, and give you seven daffodils
And kiss you, and give you seven daffodils

"Strawflower Me"

Look at me
Won't you tell me what you see
Behind the tinsel flower lady
That you made me feel I must be

Don't you know
Even tinsel flowers grow uneasy
Shining all the time
Sometimes they find they can't even glow

Could you love a blue straw-flower
With no mystic magic power
Would you miss the glitter of your fantasy
You know she isn't really me, baby

Just to please you
Maybe I can be a silver rose
But don't you know it's only straw-flower me

Could you love a blue straw-flower
With no mystic magic power
Would you miss the glitter of your fantasy
You know she isn't really me, baby, baby, baby

"Tell Old Bill"

Tell old Bill when he gets home this morning
Tell old Bill when he gets home this evening
Tell old Bill when he gets home
Leave those downtown girls alone
This morning, this evening, so soon

Old Bill's wife she was bakin' bread this morning
Old Bill's wife she was bakin' bread this evening
Old Bill's wife she was bakin' bread
When she found out that Bill was dead
This morning, this evening, so soon

She said oh no it can't be so this morning
She said oh no it can't be so this evening
She said oh no it can't be so
Bill left home about an hour ago
This morning, this evening, so soon

They brought Bill home in a hurry-up wagon this morning
Brought Bill home in a hurry-up wagon this evening
Brought Bill home in a hurry-up wagon
Brought him home with his feet a-draggin'
This morning, this evening, so soon

Tell old Bill when he gets home
Leave those downtown girls alone
This morning, this evening, so soon
This morning, this evening, so soon

"Ten Thousand Miles"

Oh, fare thee well I must be gone
And leave you for a while
Wherever I go, I will return
If I go
If I go ten thousand miles
If I go
If I go
If I go ten thousand miles

Oh, the crow that is so black my love
Would change his color white
If ever I'm false to the boy I love
Day, day would turn to night
Yes, the day
Oh, the day
Yes, the day would turn to night

Oh, the rivers never will run dry
Or the rocks melt with the sun
I'll never be false to the boy I love
Tell all, all these things be done
Tell all
No, tell all
Tell all these things be done

Fare thee well
Fare thee well
Fare thee well, my love

"The Long Black Rifle"

Come closer, my love
And I'll tell you a tale
It'll make you cold
It'll turn you pale
It's a tale of a man's
Never ending love
And the long black rifle

He wed a woman
Sworn to another
And, in a rage
The other man
Shot him down
With a long black rifle
Shot him down
And away he ran

Now a prairie man
Loved a city maid
Was the love he took
Worth the price he paid
When a man ends up
At the smoking end
Of a long black rifle

He wed a woman
Sworn to another
And, in a rage
The other man
Shot him down
With a long black rifle
Shot him down
And away he ran

Now his dyin' words
I repeat to you
You can never kill love
When your love is true
It lives when only
The rust is left
Of the long black rifle

He wed a woman
Sworn to another
And, in a rage
The other man
Shot him down
With a long black rifle
Shot him down
And away he ran

"The Reoccurring Dream"

This is the reoccurring dream
Born in the dreary gap between
What we have now
And what we wish we could have
More fulfilling--and less frustrating
Out of the envy in our eyes
Look
Glamorous picture people rise
Radiant
Gleaming down from screens and pages

Order your youth secrets of the stars

Our discontent is their delight
They offer relief for the purchase price
Love in a bottle
Love on four wheels
Is that our new car Charles
Isn't it true--isn't it true
We guarantee it--pick up your phone and dial
See here they sell you
If you had this
If you had that
I want a new truck--More power
If you use this shampoo
True love will come to you
If you had that house, car, bottle, jar

Recognize this

Who cares

"The Student Song"

Here I sit a-learnin'
Candlelight a-burnin'
Castin' flickerin' shadows on the wall
Open book before me
Tryin' its best to bore me
Up in the hills the lonesome coyote's call
Cryin' for his sweetheart
Cryin' for the moon
Cryin' just for cryin's sake
He'll have me cryin' soon
Wonder if he's lonely
Guess I'm not the only
Creature on this earth who's all alone

Spring's creepin' up the valley
And I know my best pal he's
Up there somewhere catching fireflies
But my lesson's ain't completed and I
Just can't be defeated
By the sights and sounds
That tease my ears and eyes
Outside my window
The night is full of sounds
Hootin' of a hooting owl
Layin' of my hounds

But here I sit a-learnin'
And grumblin' and gol durnin'
Ain't gonna help these lessons to go by

Eight times twelve how many
And here's a guy called Benny
Flew a kite into a lightnin' storm
Who killed ole cock robin
While all the birds were sobbin'
Gee that evenin' air smells sweet and warm
Who can study silly words
When the creek begins to run
And the crocus pops up from the ground
I challenge anyone

Now it's off to school tomorrow with
Apologies and sorrow
But I've gotta watch the season being born
Yes I've gotta watch the season being born
I've gotta watch the season being born

"Urge For Going"

I awoke today and found the frost
perched on the town
It hovered in a frozen sky, then it
gobbled summer down
When the sun turns traitor cold and all 
the trees are shivering in a naked row

I get the urge for going
But I never seem to go
I get the urge for going 
When the meadow grass is turning brown
Summertime is falling down and winter
is closing in

I had me a man in summertime
He had summer-colored skin
And not another girl in town 
My darling's heart could win
But when the leaves fell on the ground
Boy winds came around, pushed them face
down in the snow

He got the urge for going
And I had to let him go
He got the urge for going
When the meadow grass was turning brown
Summertime was falling down and winter
was closing in

Now the warriors of winter they gave a 
cold triumphant shout
And all that stays is dying and all that
lives is camping out
See the geese in chevron flight flapping 
and racing on before the snow

They got the urge for going
And they got the wings so they can go
They get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
Summertime is falling down and winter
is closing in

Apply the fire with kindling now
I'll pull the blankets up to my chin
I'll lock the vagrant winter out and
I'll fold my wandering in
I'd like to call back summertime
Have her stay for just another 
month or so

But she's got the urge for gong
So I guess she'll have to go
She gets the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
All her empire's falling down
And winter's closing in
And I get the urge for going
When the meadow grass is turning brown
And summertime is falling down

"What Will You Give Me"

What will you give me for one prairie night
Silver fields and meadows and the moon's silver light
Mister cat in the hay loft with silvery eye
All these precious possessions I'll sell, if you'll buy

What will you give me for one prairie day
The golden fields of autumn and the primrose in May
Sun's courtin' meadowlarks, off in the sky
All those precious possessions I'll sell if you'll buy

What will you give me for one prairie breeze
Rippling the grasses and rustling the trees
Wafting the scent of the newly mown hay
All those precious possessions I'll sell if you'll pay

What will you give me for one prairie sky
An amethyst sea with cloud galleons sailing by
The aurora dancing on cold winter nights
All these precious possessions I'll sell for a price

What will you give me for one prairie day
With the earth cracked and smokin'
Where we'd crossed yesterday
Gone the birds from the air, gone the child I begot
All those precious possessions I sold, and for what

"Why Do Fools Fall In Love"

Why do fools fall in love
Why do birds sing so gay
And lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love
Why does the rain fall from up above
Why do fools fall in love
Why do they fall in love
Love is a losing game
Love can be a shame
I know of a fool you see
For that fool is me
Tell me why
Tell my why

Why do birds sing so gay
And lovers await the break of day
Why do they fall in love
Why does the rain fall from up above
Why do fools fall in love
Why do they fall in love
Why does my heart skip this crazy beat
For I know
It will reach defeat
Tell me why
tell me why
Why do fools fall in love

"Drive By (For K)"

It was a drive-by Sunday night
Most of us were in bed all right
I turned down the light
Then I heard the sirens
Interrupt the silence

Is this what you wished
To commit a crime
Is this what you wished
To commit a crime
Is this what you wished
To commit a crime, commit a crime, commit a crime

He was a nice guy, really bright
Making money's hard to do right
Guilty was his plight
Now he's in a jail cell
For some thirty years now

Is this what you wished
To be serving time
Is this what you wished
To be serving time
Is this what you wished
To be serving time, serving time, serving time

K's a friend of mine
I think about him as he does time
Miss his white wine
Funny I don't feel free
Even though it's not me

Is this what you wished
To leave me behind
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind, me behind, me behind

Last year they decided
That his time is up and then he got retried
Double homicide
Sent him on to death row
Not to hang around though

Is this what you wished
Did you want to die
Is this what you wished
Did you want to die
Is this what you wished
Did you want to die, want to die, want to die
Did you want to die, want to die, want to die, want to die
Did you want to die

"Next To Me"

Another day is over
Another day is done
Now I'm getting closer
To the rising sun

Hey, there, what you doing
Would you like a little company
Hey, man, how you doing
Would you like to sit next to me

Another day is over
Another day is done
Another night I'm waiting
Waiting for the sun

Hey, there, what you doing
Would you like a little company
Hey, man, how you doing
Would you like to sit next to me

Well, I don't know, little lady
You're awfully pretty
But I'm a nice man, I live a nice life
I have a nice house, I have a great wife
And I'm tired of making
Decisions without thinking

Another moon is shining
Another evening come
Another hour unwinding
Till the night is done

Hey, man, what you doing
Would you like a little company
Hey, there, how are you doing
Would you like to sit next to me, next to me, next to me

"A Star For Nick"

Well you know it and I know it
I'm gonna be a star
You won't, you won't get me very far

Don't say hello
It's already time to go
Oh, the wind is carrying me home
Me home, me home again

Well you know it and I know it
I'm gonna be a star
You won't, you won't get me very far

You saw life back in the countryside
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh, my soul rise up and go beyond, beyond
To what you know

"My Momma"

My momma wouldn't say you were a nice guy
But you're under forty and you have a job
My momma wouldn't say you was a good boy
But you're making money and you're working hard so

I'm gonna take you on, I don't feel like it's wrong
Me and my momma, we don't get along

My momma, she would say your hair was too long
But your hair exactly is what I like the best
And my momma she would say you was a hoodlum
But I'd have known a hoodlum and you don't pass the test

I'm gonna take you on, I don't feel like it's wrong
Me and my momma, we don't get along

Oh, baby, you're standing so close, I can't back down
You're smiling and I know, I'm over and done now
I am done now

My momma'd say that it was wrong to see you
I lied just to meet you, I lied to get in
My momma she would say that I deceived you
But that's the only way I knew how to begin

So maybe you got your own problems, who doesn't
I'm crazy, you're addicted, we are all of a sudden

My momma, she would love you like I love you
If she ever met you, if she ever knew
My momma, she would fall right on top of you
If she ever saw you, she'd be smitten, too

I'll never take you home, I want you all for my own
Don't let my momma hear your pretty song
I'm gonna take you on, I don't feel like it's wrong
Me and my momma, we don't get along

"Bad Disease"

Well, there is something about watching a crime
It makes me want to go out and make it all mine
It's something about seeing you fight
It makes me want to go out tonight

I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
To fall into
Yeah, it's true

There's something about seeing him die
That puts it all into perspective and I
Want to stay home, be left alone
Someone make my mind up so I don't have to decide

I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
To fall into
Yeah, I do

There's some reason why I can't sit still
Every waking moment I feel so unfulfilled
I try to lie down, but I don't know how
Baby, when I'm sleeping, it feels less like I am dreaming

Oh, my god
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees

There's a fear I have of feeling real bad
I'm fine now, if I find out that I'm not I'll be sad
I try to quiet the thoughts in the night
Oh, they got me thinking, I'd be happier just drinking

It's not true
And I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees
Oh, no
I got a bad disease
Will no one help me please
Not even you

"Out With A Bang"

Little bits and pieces fall into the corners
Box of broken laces, lined up in an order
I'll do what you tell me, we can have it your way
I'll tell you the future, you tell me your story

I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang

Smiles from a stranger, seem to change your day when
You were just about to go and throw your towel in
Lately I've been thinking about making changes
It's been on my mind for some time and I'm anxious

I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang

Scowling like the sunshine, set on Sarasota
Happy like a twister over Oklahoma
Clear as Penny Mason lying in a coma
This is how I feel when all my hurt is over

I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang

Meet me in the morning, wrap your arms around me
Tell me that it's over, now that you have found me
Walk me to the river, see the willow bowing
Carry me into the water, now we're drowning

We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
We're going to go home again

"Dear Elliot"

You didn't think about anyone else
You didn't think about any of us when you left that place
You didn't wanna go anywhere else
Nothing could satisfy you 'til you left
So you went away

Where'd you go
Where are you now
I ask about, so many of my friends
Oh, about their ends
What about us
Are we just dust on the floor again
I thought we were on the mend

You really put me in quite a position
You got me struggling as a musician with a song
You like to write about all of your problems
Put them in songs because you think it would solve them
But you're wrong

Why did you go
I guess I know
Maybe my question is, why must it come to this
You talk about being strong, yeah
And how I want to be you and your melody

Trying to learn about something important
But you keep taking up space, you're annoying
But I love you so
Yeah, you already know

They're trying to teach me about new ways of living
They're trying to teach me about ways of forgiving
But you make it hard
You're such a bad, bad boy

I love you anyway
No matter what they say
You are not a prude, but you are on the move
I care about how this turns out
It's just more than I ever knew how to fight
I guess I won't

Tell me I have to, tell me I have to
I know you could
I said I know you could
Where are you now
I ask about

"Try Tonight"

Can't put my finger on it
But I know I want it
I'm willing to try another way
That is, if I get by another day
Back and forth, I don't get anywhere
And I've been searching everywhere

And I'll try tonight
Just try tonight

Happy as the moon shine
Sifting in the night-time
Clichs find a home inside of him
When he enters all of the lights go dim
He's so sure he's got a tragic lifestyle
And I'm so sure I can make that man smile

And I'll try tonight
Just try tonight

A dark room in the night-time
Is how he spends all his time
If he could go on without your help
Then he would do it all by himself
But I don't think he got strength to muster
And he don't got a lot  lacklustre

He'll try tonight
To not get high
He'll try tonight
To not get high
But he will, he will, he will, yes he will

"Peace (All You Need)"

You have a right
To live your life
Like no one else does
Like no one else might
If you have visions
Come on and live them out

All you need
Is some peace
While you are here
Just let go
Till you are home, dear

I had a dream
When I was young
I dreamt our lives were
Going to be found
When we were always
Waiting to live

All you need
Is some peace
While you are here
Just let go
I'll be it all, dear

You have the choice
To hear the noise
Or hear the sweet sound
Of your sweet voice
I know I've heard it
I heard it in my sleep

All you need
Is some peace
While you are here
Just let go
Don't say no, dear

Wake up each night
At the same time
Pull up the blind
And look outside
And in the orange light
The fog is rising

This is life
The still night
Peace in the quiet
Happiness
Is the sky

"I'm Indebted To You (How Do You Know Me So Well)"

What an unusual name, you said
What a spectacular redhead
You really seem like a prize to me
And you are so mysterious
When you are not delirious
Oh what you mean to me

And she said, how do you know me so well
After only one night
How do I love you, tell me
With all of my might

I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you
Always

There's something she doesn't know about
A secret he doesn't show about
A sensitive side all his own, oh my
She got her skeletons as well
Some secrets he know she'd never tell
People who keep her alone

And she said
"How did I know you so well, why am I not surprised"
He said, "Baby, go to hell."
And that was the demise of their love
Don't ever pick up a man if you don't think he'll understand
Don't ever trust yourself if you have a history of being a loving fool

So that's what she got when she married him
A lifetime promise to carry him
Him and his every second of need
I do not know you so well
Not more than that one night
Do you still love me, oh tell me
With all of your might

I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you, my love

"Pretty Baby"

Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I touch you
Then I won't touch you no more, yeah
Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I love you
Then throw my love on the floor

My mean daddy, my bad baby
Don't you want me
I don't believe you when you say
You want to leave

Darling, honey, if you don't think that you're gonna want me
Then, honey, let me know
Listen, honey, I don't wanna keep thinking you love me
Just to find out you don't

My mean daddy, my bad baby, don't you want me
I don't believe you when you say you want to leave

Aren't you gonna miss me
Honey, I'll miss you
I just wanna kiss you, tonight

Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I hold you
Then, honey, let me go
Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I told you
Then, baby, tell me so

My mean daddy, my bad baby, don't you want me
I don't believe you when you say you want to leave

"Aviation"

Do you think I'm crazy
For considering aviation
I'm a fan of flying
Why not do it for the nation
Cause I have nothing else to do
This summer but commit it to you
Have a big degree in philosophy
But I don't know what I want to be

So I'm going into aviation, yeah, mom
I'm going into aviation, yeah, dad
Going into aviation
I'm going into aviation

Do you think I'm crazy
Cause I'm up and leaving, baby
Well, I ain't got nobody
And I ain't got no money, baby, yeah
I feel high as I might tonight
So lean back and enjoy the ride
And the weather is clear, yeah, nobody is near
The future is not here

So I'm going into aviation, yeah, mom
I'm going into aviation, yeah, dad
Going into aviation
I'm going into aviation

Do you think I'm crazy
Cause I'm going to Pensacola
Where nobody knows me
Where someone could just start over
I'll be all right in a month or two
Cause it's warm there in the winter, too
Think New York is great, I really like the state
But it's time to be on my way

I'm going into aviation, yeah, mom
I'm going into aviation, yeah, dad
I'm gonna take a vacation, yeah, man
Fly fighter jets all over the nation
Fly fighter jets all over the nation

"Move"

Snow is coming down like rain
I'm at it myself again
A little tired, even more confused
Come on, baby, don't be shy
You can say what make you high
I see the way you be lying, be abused

I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, don't you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
I don't care what you think

Breathing getting fast again
Now I'll start my worrying
When will I learn that there ain't nothing I can do
Jesus was a dying man
If he can't do it, no one can
When will you learn that we ain't nothing without you

We don't need anybody when we're down
We don't really find it hard to get around
We'll find our own way back to town
And oh, don't you tell us how we need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
We don't, we don't care what you think

I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, don't you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody but me
And I don't care what you think

"Junkie Pride"

You have this way of making me
Say the opposite of everything I mean
I kiss you, I hug you
But I could not feel less connected from you

I know I wanted all this in the beginning, I really tried
I know I caught you at a not-so-happy time of your life
My dreams are bigger than your junkie pride

I don't quite fit the part of
She who loses everything and falls into insanity
The sunbeams mean nothing
If you can't find the light shining in one thing

I know I wanted all this in the beginning, I really tried
I know I caught you at a not-so-happy time of your life
My dreams are bigger than your junkie pride

It's fine if you're hateful
As long as all in all you remain grateful

It made me nervous to know you didn't like me, I really tried
The way I'm feeling in this moment, it can't last my whole life
My dreams are bigger than your junkie pride

"Birds Of A Feather"

Met you in front of a diner and you had blue hair
You were so nice
You were from L.A. but you were all there
You were all right

So many people say that they have it together
But I think you're a nice guy
And I think we could be birds of a feather

Met you in front of a diner and you were so sweet
Made my heart beat, oh, my, my, my, my, my
I met you with your mother and she had green shoes
She was so cool, it was fine, fine, fine, fine, fine

So many people say that they have it together
But I think you're a nice guy
And I think we could be birds of a feather
Oh, feather, oh, birds

You were sorting pictures and you gave me one
Of a nun who was playing the drums
She was crazy, her name was Katie
I think you're so fun

So many people say that they have it together
But I think you're a nice guy
And I think we could be birds of a feather

You don't think I'm that strange, you're so weird
That's 'cause you're so queer
But who's not these days
You wear purple socks and you still like Purple Haze

So many people think that you have it together
But they don't see you crying in the shower
Bet I can make you better
'Cause you make me better
Yeah, you make me better
Yeah, you make me better

"Kill Kill"

Bound up the stairs
I'm in the shower
Do you know I am going to leave you
Do you know I am going to leave you

I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love, lying in the sand
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can, mm

Tell me about Ray and his girl
Do I know Ray has gone to meet you
Love you, I do
Stay here, I won't
The stars fade from your eyes

I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love, lying in the sand
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can

One, two, make it fun
Don't trust anyone
One, two, make it fun
Don't trust anyone

I'm in love with a dying man

Make it fun, make it fun

"Queen Of The Gas Station"

Give me coffee, king-sized cup
Come on, Kitty cat fill her up
What's your name, little buttercup
That's for me to know and you to make up

Love casinos

But, baby, if you love me
Take me to the gas station
Gas station

Me, I spend them looking for men I might like
Like you, like you, like you

Take me to the gas station
Take me to the gas station

Give me coffee, Utah love
I'm the kind of girl you dream of
And I'm trying to tell you what I dream of
And that's gas stations
With Slurpee machines and organs playing
Preferably with smoking inside
If you can swing it (swing it, swing it, swing it)
And I'd be real pleased if we could find one just like it
Again, again
Again, again

Take me to the gas station

"Oh Say Can You See"

Oh say can you see
My stars
The night time is almost ours
To wander through alleys
And look at the bars
Nighttime is almost ours

The headlights from passing cars
They illuminate my face and
Leave me the dark
The voice of Nirvana says
"Come as you are"
And I will
Nighttime is almost ours

The sway of the hips and arms
Will cradle you from afar
They swing 'til you're tired
And send you to Mars
Nighttime is almost ours

"Gramma"

Gramma said she'll leave the lights on for me
Gramma said the flags are waving for me
Gramma said that somewhere out there there's a good man
Waiting for me

A-M-E-R-I-C-A
All I want to do is play
See the city every day

Happy that I make you glad
Cause I don't want to think I'm bad, Gramma

"For K Part 2"

Alright, you caught me, I don't play a good guitar but
What do you want from me, it's just a stupid bar and
I didn't promise anything, no
You think I'm pretty and you like the way I talk
I like your music and you like the way I walk
So, I think we're gonna get along

I like the way you wear your sweater off your shoulder
The way your hair comes down and makes you look older
How are you getting so handsome, my boy

Pretty baby
Pretty baby

The way your face is shaped, I wonder if you know
The way you stand up and your silhouette glows
I'm electrified, I'll be up all night now
Use that voice, sing that song
And tell me to come on, to come on, come on
You won't hear no, you won't hear no

Pretty baby
Pretty baby
Pretty baby

"Jump"

Palm trees in black and white
Last thing I saw before I died
Palm trees in black and white
Was the last thing I saw before I died
Right line, right man
Right mixture of cocaine and heroin

Do you wanna jump, jump, jump
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump
Do you, do you wanna

Hair thinning in the wind
Cadillac convertible with him
I was shot at 2 AM
You got the grin of a very old man

Do you wanna jump, jump, jump
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump
Do you, do you wanna

Palm trees in black and white
You are a junkie on your window smiling wide
Palm trees in black and white
Lean forward and you close your eyes
Last fight, fuck them
Last words before you went under again

Do you wanna jump, jump, jump
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump
Do you, do you wanna

Just do what you love
Just do what you can
Just do what you love
Just do what you can
Just do what you love
Do it better than
(Do you wanna)

"Mermaid Motel"

Maybe we could go to Coney Island
Maybe I could sing the national anthem
Buy a white sweater for the last white day of the summer
Buy my purple wig for my mermaid video
Walk back to where I live in my motel on Neptune (Avenue)

You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off

(Maybe we could go to) Suede Tokyo
Or see Van Halen at their reunion show
Heavy metal hour on TV
Diamond Dave and Ray Lee
And you salute me, Miss America
Because I am, I am

You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off

Maybe we could go to Coney Island
Maybe I could sing you to sleep
God bless the universe, god bless the ocean
God bless you and god bless me
God bless you and god bless me

You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off

Mississippi south

Putting crystals on our neck
Lifting my feet off
The ground, the ground

"Pawn Shop Blues"

Well, I didn't know it would come to this but
That's what happens when you're on your own
And you're alright with letting nice things go

Well, I pawned the earrings that you gave me
Golden metal flowers dangling
And I almost cried as I sold them off
And I don't mind living on bread and oranges, no, no
But I got to get to and from where I come
And it's gon' take money to go

Oh, no
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh

In the name of higher consciousness
I let the best man I knew go
'Cause it's nice to love and be loved
But it's better to know all you can know
I said it's nice to love and be loved
But I'd rather know what God knows

Oh, no
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no
Oh, no

I can do this once more
No man can keep me together
Been broken since I was born

Well, I didn't know it would come to this but
That's what happens when you're on your own
And you're alright with letting nice things go

Yes, you
Yayo

You have to take me right now
From this dark trailer park life now
Yayo
How now

"Born To Die"

Why ("Got that")
Who, me ("Louder")
Why ("Got that")

Feet don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping at the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine
It's like I told you, honey ("Louder")

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laughlet's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane ("Louder", "Alright")
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and Iwe were born to die

Lost, but now I am found
I can see that once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get, scared that I couldn't find
All the answers I need ("Louder")

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laughlet's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane ("Louder", "Alright")
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and Iwe were born to die ("Louder", "Got that")
We were born to die ("Louder", "Alright")
We were born to die
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

So don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laughlet's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain

"Off To The Races"

My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart

He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a LA crass
Way about me
He loves me
With every beat of his cocaine heart

Swimming pool glimmering darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples
You sitting sipping on your Black Cristal

Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Give me them gold coins, give me them coins

And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out

Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

My old man is a tough man
But he's got a soul as sweet as blood-red jam
And he shows me
He knows me
Every inch of my tar-black soul

He doesn't mind I have a flat broke-down life
In fact he says he thinks it's what he might like
About me
Admires me
The way I roll like a rolling stone

Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom, Chateau Marmont
Slipping on my red dress, putting on my make-up
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac
Fumes, says it feels like heaven to him

Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me, give me them coins

And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out

Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth

Yo I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is
Tight and I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you but I'm going down

God I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raising hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it

My old man is a thief and I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord to watch over us
Take him when he may, if he may
I'm not afraid to say
That I'd die without him

Who else is gonna put up with me this way
I need you, I breathe you, I never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you

You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said "Hon'
You never looked so beautiful as you do now, my man."

And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is
Down and now we're going in
To Las Vegas chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin

Boy you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

You are my one true love

"Blue Jeans"

Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer

You were sorta punk rock,
I grew up on hip-hop
But you fit me better
Than my favourite sweater,
And I know that love is mean,
And love hurts
But I still remember
That day we met in December,
Oh, baby

I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears
Love you more
Than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh, baby, say you'll remember, oh, baby, ooh
I will love you 'til the end of time

Big dreams, gangster
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, "No please, stay here.
We don't need no money we can make it all work."

But he headed out on Sunday,
Said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waitin',
Anticipatin', and pacin'
But he was chasing paper
"Caught up in the game."
That was the last I heard

I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears
Love you more
Than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh, baby, say you'll remember, oh, baby, ooh
I will love you 'til the end of time

You went out every night
And, baby, that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did I'd be by your side
'Cause I'mma ride or die
Whether you fail or fly
Well, shit at least you tried.

But when you walked out that door,
A piece of me died
I told you I wanted more,
But that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before
We were dancing all night
Then they took you away,
Stole you out of my life
You just need to remember...

I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears
Love you more
Than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember, oh, baby, ooh
I will love you 'til the end of time

"Video Games"

Swinging in the backyard
Pull up in your fast car
Whistling my name

Open up a beer
And you say, "Get over here
And play a video game."

I'm in his favorite sundress
Watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown

I say, "You the bestest."
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on

Go play a video game

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do

Singing in the old bars
Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame

Kissing in the blue dark
Playing pool and wild darts
Video games

He holds me in his big arms
Drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of

Watching all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do

Now you do
Now you do
Now you do

Now, now you do
Now you do
Now you do

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do

Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do

Now, now you do
Now you do
Now you do

Now, now you do

Do you think we'll be in love forever

Baby, put on heart-shaped sunglasses
'Cause we gonna take a ride

Say it's gonna be alright

Let's take Jesus off the dashboard

Saved too many times
Maybe I like this roller coaster
Maybe it keeps me high
Maybe the speed, it brings me closer
I could sparkle up your eye

"National Anthem"

Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address

I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on" He said, "Yes" (Yes, yes)

Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, making me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact
Kiss, kiss

I sing the national anthem while I'm standing over your body
Hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron
He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealing with
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds
("Yes, of course I will, my darling")

Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, making me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of
Sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon

Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, making me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success

"Dark Paradise"

All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh
That's how you sang it

Loving you forever, can't be wrong
Even though you're not here, won't move on
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh
That's how we played it

And there's no remedy
For memory
Your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me
And telling me
That everything is fine
But I wish I was dead
(Dead like you)

Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you
Won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you
Won't be waiting on the other side

All my friends ask me why I stay strong
Tell 'em when you find true love it lives on
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh
That's why I stay here

And there's no remedy
For memory
Your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me
And telling me
That everything is fine
But I wish I was dead
(Dead like you)

Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you
Won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you
Except in my dreams tonight

Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight

There's no relief
I see you in my sleep
And everybody's rushing me
But I can feel you touching me
There's no release
I feel you in my dreams
Telling me I'm fine

Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side (So tell me)
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you
Except in my dreams tonight

Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight

"Radio"

Not even they can stop me now
Boy, I be flying overhead
Their heavy words can't bring me down
Boy, I've been raised from the dead

No one even knows how hard life was
I don't even think about it now because
I finally found you
(Oh, sing it to me)

Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now
Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now

American dreams came true somehow
I swore I'd chase 'em 'til I was dead
I heard the streets were paved with gold
That's what my father said

No one even knows what life was like
Now I'm in L.A. and it's paradise
I finally found you
(Oh, sing it to me)

Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now
Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now

Sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now
Sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
I finally found you
(Oh, sing it to me)

Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now
Lick me up and take me like a vitamin

"Carmen"

Darling, darling
Doesn't have a problem
Lying to herself
'Cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarming, honestly
How charming she can be
Fooling everyone
Telling 'em she's having fun

She says, "You don't want to be like me
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen
I'm dying, I'm dying"
She says, "You don't want to get this way
Famous and dumb at an early age
Lying, I'm lying"

The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shining
Like lightning, whoa, whoa
White lightning

Carmen, Carmen
Staying up 'til morning
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarming, truly
How disarming you can be
Eating soft ice cream
Coney Island queen

She says, "You don't want to be like me
Looking for fun, getting high for free
I'm dying, I'm dying"
She says, "You don't want to get this way
Street walk at night and a star by day
It's tiring, tiring"

The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies
Bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shining
Like lightning, whoa, whoa
White lightning

Baby's all dressed up with nowhere to go
That's the little story of the girl you know
Relying on the kindness of strangers
Tying cherry knots
Smiling, doing party favors
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song, song, now the camera's on
And you're alive again

Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
Tu as besoin de moi, tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie
Tu ne peux vivre sans moi
Et je mourrais sans toi
Je tuerais pour toi

The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies
Bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shining
Like lightning, whoa, whoa
White lightning
Like lightning, whoa, whoa
White lightning

Darling, darling
Doesn't have a problem
Lying to herself
'Cause her liquor's top shelf

"Million Dollar Man"

You said I was the most exotic flower
Holding me tight in our final hour

I don't know how you convince them and get them, boy
I don't know what you do, it's unbelievable
And I don't know how you get over, get over
Someone as dangerous, tainted and flawed as you

One for the money, two for the show
I love you honey, I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke

You got the world but baby at what price
Something so strange, hard to define

It isn't that hard boy to like you or love you
I'd follow you down down down
You're unbelievable
If you're going crazy just grab me and take me
I'd follow you down down down, anywhere anywhere

One for the money, two for the show
I love you honey, I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke

One for the money, two for the show
I love you honey, I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke

I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke

"Summertime Sadness"

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feeling alive

Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

(1, 2, 3, 4)

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm feeling electric tonight
Cruising down the coast going 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

(1, 2, 3, 4)

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive (drive, drive)

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

"This Is What Makes Us Girls"

Remember how we used to party up all night
Sneaking out, looking for a taste of real life
Drinking in the small town firelight
(Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice)
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Walking down the streets as they whistle, "Hi, hi"
Stealing police cars with the senior guys
Teachers said we'd never make it out alive

There she was, my new best friend
High heels in her hand, swaying in the wind
Oh, she starts to cry, mascara running down her little Bambi eyes
"Lana, how I hate those guys"

This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Something that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen (Happen, happen)

And that's where the beginning of the end begun
Everybody knew that we had too much fun
We were skipping school and drinking on the job
With the boss
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Baby's table dancing at the local dive
Cheering our names in the pink spotlight
Drinking cherry schnapps in the velvet night

Yeah, we used to go break into the hotel
Glimmering, we'd swim
Running from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screaming, "Get us while we're hot, get us while we're hot"
(C'mon, take a shot)

This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Something that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen (Happen, happen)

The prettiest in-crowd that you had ever seen
Ribbons in our hair and our eyes gleamed mean
A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens
And you know something
They were the only friends I ever had
We got into trouble and when stuff got bad
I got sent away, I was waving on the train platform
Crying 'cause I know I'm never coming back

This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Something that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen, oh

"Without You"

Everything I want, I have
Money, notoriety, and rivieras
I even think I found God
In the flashbulbs of the pretty cameras
Pretty cameras, pretty cameras
Am I glamorous Tell me, am I glamorous

Hello Hello
Ca-can you hear me
I can be your china doll if you wanna see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

Summertime is nice and hot
And my life is sweet like vanilla is
Gold and silver-lined, my heart
But burned into my brain, all these stolen images
Stolen images, baby, stolen images
Can you picture it Babe, that life we could've lived

Hello Hello
Ca-can you hear me
I can be your china doll if you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

We were two kids just trying to get out
Lived on the dark side of the American dream
We would dance all night, play our music loud
When we grew up, nothing was what it seemed

Hello Hello
Ca-can you hear me
I can be your china doll if you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they think that I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

Hello Hello
Ca-can you hear me
I can be your china doll if you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they think that I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing if I can't have you

"Lolita"

Would you be mine
Would you be my baby tonight
Could be kissing my fruit punch lips in the bright sunshine
'Cause I like you quite a lot, everything you got
Don't you know
It's you that I adore
Though I make the boys fall like dominoes

Kiss me in the D-A-R-K, dark tonight
(D-A-R-K, do it my way)
Kiss me in the P-A-R-K, park tonight
(P-A-R-K, let them all say)

Hey Lolita, hey Hey Lolita, hey
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey Hey Lolita, hey
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skipping rope, skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feeling the heat even when the sun goes down

I could be yours, I could be your baby tonight
Topple you down from your sky forty stories high
Shining like a god, can't believe I caught you and so
Look at what I bought, not a second thought, oh, Romeo

Kiss me in the D-A-R-K, dark tonight
(D-A-R-K, do it my way)
Kiss me in the P-A-R-K, park tonight
(P-A-R-K, let them all say)

Hey Lolita, hey Hey Lolita, hey
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey Hey Lolita, hey
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skipping rope, skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feeling the heat even when the sun goes down

I want my cake and I wanna eat it too
I want to have fun and be in love with you
I know that I'm a mess with my long hair
And my suntan, short dress, bare feet, I don't care
What they say about me, what they say about me
Because I know that it's L-O-V-E
You make me happy, you make me happy
And I never listen to anyone
(Let them all say)

Hey Lolita, hey Hey Lolita, hey
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey Hey Lolita, hey
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skipping rope, skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feeling the heat even when the sun goes down

"Lucky Ones"

Let's get out of this town, baby, we're on fire
Everyone around here seems to be going down, down, down
If you stick with me, I can take you higher and higher
It feels like all of our friends are lost
Nobody's found, found, found

I got so scared, I thought no one could save me
You came along, scooped me up like a baby

Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time

Boy, get into my car, got a bad desire
You know that we'll never leave if we don't get out now, now, now
You're a careless con and you're a crazy liar, but baby
Nobody can compare to the way you get down, down, down

I tried so hard to act nice like a lady
You taught me that it was good to be crazy

Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time

Feels like, feels like, you know it feels like
Falling in love for the first time
Feels like, you know it feels like
Falling in love

Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time

"Ride"

I been out on that open road
But you can be my full-time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
But you can be my full-time baby, hot or cold

Don't break me down (Don't break me down)
I been traveling too long (I been traveling too long)
I been trying too hard (I been trying too hard)
With one pretty song (With one pretty song)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life and art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it, light 'til dark

Don't leave me now (Don't leave me now)
Don't say goodbye (Don't say goodbye)
Don't turn around (Don't turn around)
Leave me high and dry (Leave me high and dry)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
It's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just ride

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

"American"

Play house, put my favorite record on
Get down, get your crystal method on
You were like tall, tan, driving 'round the city
Flirting with the girls like you're so pretty
"Springsteen is the King, don't ya think"
I was like, "Hell yeah, that guy can sing"
Like ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child
Your skin so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud

"Cola (Pussy)"

My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
My eyes are wide like cherry pies
I gots a taste for men who are older
It's always been so it's no surprise

Ah, he's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy
(I come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby

Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Oh, oh yeah

I fall asleep in an American flag
I wear my diamonds on Skid Row
I pledge allegiance to my dad
For teaching me everything he knows

Ah, he's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy
(I come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby

Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine

We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

Decorate my neck, diamantes ices

"Body Electric"

Elvis is my daddy
Marilyn's my mother
Jesus is my bestest friend
We don't need nobody
'Cause we got each other
Or at least I pretend

We get down every Friday night
Dancing and grinding in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry
We're feeling alright
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind
(I said, "Don't worry 'bout it")

I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric
Sing that body electric
Sing that body electric
I'm on fire
Sing that body electric

Whitman is my daddy
Monaco's my mother
Diamonds are my bestest friend
Heaven is my baby
Suicide's her father
Opulence is the end

We get down every Friday night
Dancing and grinding in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry
We're feeling alright
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind
(I said, "Don't worry 'bout it")

I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric
Sing that body electric
Sing that body electric
I'm on fire
Sing that body electric

My clothes still smell like you
And all the photographs say you're still young
I pretend I'm not hurt
And go about the world like I'm having fun

We get crazy every Friday night
Drop it like it's hot in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry
Feeling alright
Mary swaying softly to her heart's delight

I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric
Sing that body electric
Sing that body electric
I'm on fire
Sing that body electric

I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric, baby

"Blue Velvet"

She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars

She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May, her tender sighs
Love was ours

Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left, gone was the glow of

Blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory
Through the years

And I still can see blue velvet through my tears

"Gods & Monsters"

L.A., L.A
L.A., L.A

In the land of gods and monsters
I was an angel living in the garden of evil
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shining like a fiery beacon

You got that medicine I need
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
Me and God, we don't get along, so now I sing

No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost

In the land of gods and monsters
I was an angel looking to get fucked hard
Like a groupie incognito, posing as a real singer
Life imitates art

You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart, please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said, "Baby, that's alright with me"

No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost

When you talk, it's like a movie and you're making me crazy
'Cause life imitates art
If I get a little prettier, can I be your baby
You tell me life isn't that hard

No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost

"Yayo"

I like the snake on your tattoo
I like the ivy and the ink blue
Yayo
Yes, you
Yayo

You have to take me right now
From this dark trailer park life now
Yayo
How now
Yayo

Put me onto your black motorcycle
50s' baby doll dress for my "I do"
It only takes two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama

Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Let me put on a show

I need you like a baby when I hold you
Like a druggy, like I told you
Yayo
Yeah, you
Yayo

Put me onto your black motorcycle
50s' baby doll dress for my "I do"
It only takes two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama

Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Let me put on a show

Hello, heaven, you are a tunnel-lined
With yellow lights on a dark night
Yayo
Yes, you
Yayo

Put me onto your black motorcycle
50s' baby doll dress for my "I do"
It only takes two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama

Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Let me put on a show

"Bel Air"

Gargoyles standing at the front of your gate
Trying to tell me to wait, but I can't wait to see you
So I run like I'm mad to heaven's door
I don't wanna be bad, I won't cheat you no more

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see, late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

Spotlight, bad baby, you've got a flair
For the violentest kind of love anywhere out there
Mon amour, sweet child of mine, you're divine
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's okay to shine

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see, late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

Don't be afraid of me
Don't be ashamed
Walk in the way of my soft resurrection
Idol of roses, iconic soul
I know your name
Lead me to war with your brilliant direction

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see, late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Grenadine, sunshinecan you break this heart of mine
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

"Burning Desire"

Every Saturday night, I get dressed up to ride for you, baby
Cruising down the street on Hollywood and Vine for you, baby
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care
You ask me where I've been I been everywhere
But I don't want to be nowhere but here

Over, over again like my only prayer

"Cruel World"

Shared my body and my mind with you
That's all over now
Did what I had to do
'Cause you're so far past me now
Shared my body and my life with you
That's way over now
There's not more a mind can do
You're so famous now

"Ultraviolence"

He used to call me DN
That stood for Deadly Nightshade
'Cause I was filled with poison
But blessed with beauty and rage
Jim told me that, he hit me and it felt like a kiss
Jim brought me back, reminded me of when we were kids

With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence

He used to call me poison
Like I was Poison Ivy
I could have died right there
'Cause he was right beside me
Jim raised me up, he hurt me but it felt like true love
Jim taught me that, loving him was never enough

With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence

We could go back to New York
Loving you was really hard
We could go back to Woodstock
Where they don't know who we are
Heaven is on Earth
I would do anything for you, baby
Blessed is this union
Crying tears of gold like lemonade

I love you the first time, I love you the last time
Yo soy la princesa, comprende mis white lines
'Cause I'm your jazz singer and you're my cult leader
I love you forever, I love you forever

With his ultraviolence (Lay me down tonight)
Ultraviolence (In my linen and curls)
Ultraviolence (Lay me down tonight)
Ultraviolence (Riviera Girls)
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence

"Shades Of Cool"

My baby lives in shades of blue
Blue eyes and jazz and attitude
He lives in California, too
He drives a Chevy Malibu
And when he calls, he calls for me and not for you
He lives for love, he loves his drugs, he loves his baby, too

But I can't fix him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather

But you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

My baby lives in shades of cool
Cold heart and hands and aptitude
He lives for love, for women, too
I'm one of many, Bonnie's blue
And when he calls, he calls for me and not for you
He prays for love, he prays for peace, and maybe someone new

But I can't help him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather

'Cause you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

Your hot, hot weather in the summer
High, high, neglectful lover
Hot, hot weather in the summer
High, neglectful lover
You're crumbling, sadly
You're sadly, crumbling

You are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

Pa pa da pa
Pa pa da ah, oh
Oh, oh

Pa-da-da-da-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da

They say I'm too young to love you
I don't know what I need
They think I don't understand
The freedom land of the seventies
I think I'm too cool to know ya
You say I'm like the ice I freeze
I'm churning out novels like
Beat poetry on amphetamines

I say
I say

Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da
Pa-da-da-da-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da

They say I'm too young to love you
They say I'm too dumb to see
They judge me like a picture book
By the colors, like they forgot to read
I think we're like fire and water
I think we're like the wind and sea
You're burning up, I'm cooling down
You're up, I'm down
You're blind, I see

But I'm free
I'm free

Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

I'm talking about my generation
Talking about that newer nation
And if you don't like it
You can beat it
Beat it, baby
You never liked the way I said it
If you don't get it, then forget it
'Cause I don't have to fucking explain it

And my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get high on hydroponic weed
And my jazz collection's rare
I get down to Beat poetry
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-de-da
Te-de-de, da-da-ah
Ooh, oh

"West Coast"

Down on the West coast, they got a saying
"If you're not drinking, then you're not playing"
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you
Down on the West coast, I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment, you for the moment
Boy Blue, yeah, you

You're falling hard, I push away, I'm feeling hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much
But something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive, I'm a lush
Your love, your love, my love

I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y cubano como yo, la-la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love (I'm in love)

(Mic-check)
(One, two)
(Two, two)
(Get it, girl)

Down on the West coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you
Down on the West coast, they love their movies
Their golden gods and Rock 'n' Roll groupies
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you

You push it hard, I pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
Te deseo, cario, boy, it's you I desire
Your love, your love, my love

I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y cubano como yo, la-la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love

"Pretty When You Cry"

All the pretty stars shine for you, my love
Am I that girl that you dream of
All those little times you said that I'm your girl
You make me feel like your whole world

I'll wait for you, babe
That's all I do, babe
Don't come through, babe
You never do

Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry

All those special times I spent with you, my love
They don't mean shit compared to all your drugs
But I don't really mind, I've got much more than that
Like my memories, I don't need that

I wait for you, babe
You don't come through, babe
You never do, babe
That's just what you do

Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry

Don't say you need me when
You leave and you leave again
I'm stronger than all my men
Except for you
Don't say you need me if
You know that you're leaving
I can't do it, I can't do it
But you do it well

'Cause I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry

"Money Power Glory"

You say that you wanna go
To a land that's far away
How are we supposed to get there
With the way that we're living today
You talk lots about God
Freedom comes from the call
But that's not what this bitch wants
Not what I want at all

I want money, power and glory
I want money and all your power, all your glory
Hallelujah, I wanna take you for all that you got
Hallelujah, I'm gonna take them for all that they got

Baby

The sun also rises on those who fail the call
My life, it comprises of losses and wins and fails and falls
But I can do it if you really, really like that
I know what you really want, b-baby
I can do it if you think you'll like that
You should run, boy, run

I want money, power and glory
I want money and all your power, all your glory
Hallelujah, I wanna take you for all that you got
Hallelujah, I'm gonna take them for all that they got

Baby, baby

"Fucked My Way Up To The Top"

Life is awesome, I confess

You got nothing, I got tested
And I passed, yes

Lay me down tonight in my linen and curls
Lay me down tonight, Riviera girls

Go, baby, go
Go, go, go, go, go

Mimicking me's a fucking bore
To me, but babe

Lay me down tonight in my diamonds and pearls
Tell me songs at night 'bout your favorite girl

I fucked my way up to the top
This is my show
I fucked my way up to the top
Go, baby, go
Go, go, go, go, go

Go, go, go, go, go

"Old Money"

Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne, and white sunshine
Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine
The kids were young and pretty

Where have you been Where did you go
Those summer nights seem long ago
And so is the girl you used to call
The Queen of New York City

But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come

The power of youth is on my mind
Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time
Will you still love me when I shine
From words but not from beauty

My father's love was always strong
My mother's glamour lives on and on
Yet still inside, I felt alone
For reasons unknown to me

But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come

And if you call, I'll run, run, run
If you change your mind, I'll come, come, come

Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne, and hot sunshine
Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine
And we were young and pretty

"The Other Woman"

The other woman has time to manicure her nails
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair anywhere

The other woman enchants her clothes with French perfume
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
And there are never toys that's scattered everywhere

And when her old man comes to call
He finds her waiting like a lonesome queen
'Cause to be by her side
It's such a change from old routine
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

The other woman will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by, the other woman will spend her life alone
Alone

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby, do, do
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, oh
Oh, oh
Alone

"Black Beauty"

I paint my nails black
I dye my hair a darker shade of brown
'Cause you like your women Spanish
Dark, strong and proud
I paint the sky black
You said if you could have your way
You'd make it nighttime all today
So it'd suit the mood of your soul

Oh, what can I do
Nothing, my sparrow blue
Oh, what can I do
Life is beautiful but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

Black beauty, oh oh oh
Black beauty, oh oh oh

I paint the house black
My wedding dress black leather too
You have no room for light
Love is lost on you
I keep my lips red
To seem like cherries in the spring
Darling, you can't let everything
Seem so dark blue

Oh, what can I do
To turn you on or get through you
Oh, what can I do
Life is beautiful but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

Black beauty, oh oh oh
Black beauty, oh oh oh

Black beauty, ah ah
Black beauty, ah ah
Black beauty, ah ah ah ah
Black beauty, baby
Black beauty, baby

Oh, what can I do
Life is beautiful but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

Black beauty, oh oh oh
Black beauty, oh oh oh
Black beauty, oh oh oh
Black beauty, oh oh oh

"Guns And Roses"

Heavy metal love of mine
I should have learned to let you stay
You didn't want me all the time
But you were worth it anyway

'Cause you were so much better
Than the rest of them
Out of all the others
You were the honest man

He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns
And roses, roses, roses

Motorcycle love divine
I should have learned to let you play
I wasn't the marrying kind
I should have done it anyway

We should have left Las Vegas
And then began again
Took your bike to Detroit
Back to the promised land

He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns
And roses, roses, roses

I can feel it coming in the air tonight
See you walking on that blue Pacific
I can see you bathing in the summer light
Turning tan and you look terrific
You got game boy, game boy
You got game boy, game boy
You got game boy, game boy
You got game

He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses

"Florida Kilos"

White lines, pretty baby, tattoos
Don't know what they mean
They're special, just for you
White lines, baking powder on the stove
Cooking up a dream, turning diamonds into snow

I feel you, pretty baby, feel me
Turn it up hot, loving you is free
I like it down, like it down way low
But you already know that
You already know

Mm-mm, pretty baby
White lines, pretty baby
Gold teeth, pretty baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Dance the night away

"Is This Happiness"

High up in the Hollywood Hills taking violet pills
Writing all of my songs about my cheap thrills
You're a hard man to love and I'm
A hard woman to keep track of
You like to rage, don't do that
You want your way, you make me so mad
Got your gun, I've got my dad

Is this happiness
Is this happiness
Is this happiness
Is this happiness

High up in the Hollywood Hills crushing violet pills
You've been trying to write a novel about your cheap thrills
You think you're Hunter S. Thompson
I think you're fucking crazy as the day's long
Man to man, heart to heart
I love you but you drive me so far
Wish you well on that star

Is this happiness
Is this happiness
Is this happiness
Is this happiness

Witch Hazel, Witch Hazel
Betrayal, betrayal
One gun on the table
Headshot if you're able

Is this happiness
Is this happiness
Is this happiness
Is this happiness

"Flipside"

Are you gonna hurt me now
Or are you gonna hurt me later
Are you gonna go to town
Maybe you should play it safer

You've got me all dressed up tonight
Springsteen on the radio
You've got me all freaked out tonight
Something you're telling me, what I don't know

You don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry, but
You caught me once
Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again

Drinks on the patio

Are you gonna tell me now
Are you gonna tell me later
'Cause if you think that I don't know
I'm gonna have to say you're crazy

I'm getting all dressed up tonight
Dressed up just to hear you, boy
I already know what you got in store
Why I go Baby, I don't know

'Cause you don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry, but
You caught me once
Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
Maybe on the flipside I could catch me again

So you think you're in charge
Do you
Acting like a big shot
I'm sure
So you think you're in charge
Do you
You're acting like a big shot

You don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry but
You caught me once
Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again

"West Coast (Radio Mix)"

Down on the West Coast, they got a saying
"If you're not drinking, then you're not playing"
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you
Down on the West Coast, I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the music, you for the music
It's true, it's true

I push it hard, you pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I'm feeling like there's no one else, brings me higher and higher
Te deseo, cario, boy it's you I desire
Your love, your love, your love

I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love (I'm in love, I'm in love)

Down on the West Coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you

You pull me close, I push away... I'm feeling hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much
But something keeps me really quiet
I'm alive, I'm a lush
Hold me close you say, hush baby hush

I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love

I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love

I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love

"Honeymoon"

We both know that it's not fashionable to love me
But you don't go 'cause, truly, there's nobody for you but me
We could cruise to the blues
Wilshire Boulevard, if we choose
Or whatever you wanna do
We make the rules

Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon

Say you want me too
Say you want me too
Dark blue
Dark blue

We both know the history of violence that surrounds you
But I'm not scared, there's nothing to lose now that I've found you
And we could cruise to the news
Pico Boulevard in your used
Little bullet car if we choose

Mr. Born-To-Lose

Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon

Say you want me too
Say you want me too
Dark blue
Dark blue

There are violets in your eyes
There are guns that blaze around you
There are roses in between my thighs and fire that surrounds you
It's no wonder every man in town had neither fought nor found you

Everything you do is elusive, too, even your honey dew

Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon

Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life

Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life

"Music To Watch Boys To"

(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(With ribbons in knots)
Play 'em like guitars, only one of my toys
('Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I was sent to destroy, yeah

Pink flamingos
Always fascinated me
I know what only the girls know
Hoes with lies akin to me

I, I see you're going
So I play my music, watch you leave

(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(With ribbons in knots)
Play 'em like guitars, only one of my toys
('Cause I like you a lot)
No holds barred, I was sent to destroy, yeah

Velveteen and living single
It never felt that right to me
I know what only the girls know
Lies can buy eternity

I, I see you leaving
So I push record and watch you leave

(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
(With ribbons in knots)
Play 'em like guitars, only one of my toys

No holds barred, I was sent to destroy, yeah

I live to love you
And I love to love you
And I live to love you, boy
I live to love you
And I love to love you
And I live to love you, boy
Nothing gold can stay
Like love or lemonade
Or sun or summer days
It's all a game to me anyway

(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
(So I do what you want)
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise

No holds barred, I was sent to destroy, yeah

Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys

"Terrence Loves You"

You are what you are
I don't matter to anyone
But Hollywood legends
Will never grow old
And all of what's hidden
Well, it will never grow cold

But I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got those blues
And I lost myself when I lost you
And I still get trashed, darling, when I hear your tunes

But you are who you are
I won't change you for anything
For when you are crazy
I'll let you be bad
I'll never dare change thee
To what you are not

But I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got those blues
I lost myself and I lost you too
And I still get trashed, baby, when I hear your tunes

I put the radio on, hold you tight in my mind
Isn't strange that you're not here with me
I'm putting all the lights on and the television
Trying to transmit, can you hear me
Ground control to Major Tom
Can you hear me all night long
Ground control to Major Tom

Well, I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got the blues
I lost myself and I lost you too
And I still get trashed, honey, when I hear your tunes

"God Knows I Tried"

Sometimes, I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow skies
It's so crazy, I could drink it like tequila sunrise

Put on that Hotel California
Dance around like I'm insane
I feel free when I see no one
And nobody knows my name

God knows I lived, God knows I died
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried
God knows I loved, God knows I lied
God knows I lost, God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried, God knows I tried

Sometimes, I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow lights
On Monday they destroy me
But by Friday I'm revived

Put on that Hotel California
Wear my blinders in the rain
I've got nothing much to live for
Ever since I found my fame

God knows I lived, God knows I died
God knows I loved, God knows I lied
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried
God knows I lost, God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried, God knows I tried

So let there be light
Let there be light
Light up my life, light up my life
Let there be light, let there be light
Light up my life, light up my life

And God knows I tried, God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried

"High By The Beach"

High-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh

Boy, look at you, looking at me
I know you know how I feel
Loving you is hard, being here's harder
You take the wheel
I don't wanna do this anymore
It's so surreal
I can't survive
If this is all that's real

All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by, baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye bye

Boy, look at you, looking at me
I know you don't understand
You could be a bad motherfucker
But that don't make you a man
Now you're just another one of my problems
Because you got out of hand
We won't survive
We're sinking into the sand

All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye bye

Lights, camera, accin
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want
Lights, camera, accin
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want

All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye bye

High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh

Anyone can start again
Not through love, but through revenge
Through the fire, we're born again
Peace by vengeance, brings the end
(High-igh-igh-igh)

"Freak"

Flames so hot that they turn blue
Palms reflecting in your eyes, like an endless summer
That's the way I feel for you
If time stood still, I'd take this moment, make it last forever

Your halo's full of fire
I'm rising up, rising up
My hot love's full of fire
Love's full of fire
La, ah

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

Leather black and eyes of blue (blue, blue, blue)
Sun reflecting in your eyes, like an easy rider
Life makes sense when I'm with you
Looking back, my past
It all seems stranger than a stranger

So let's dance in slow motion
Tear it up, tear it up
Let's dance by the ocean
Ah, ah

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

Ooh-ooh
You're cold as ice, baby
But when you're nice, baby
You're so amazing in every way
Ooh-ooh
You're cold as ice, baby
I don't wanna fight, baby
It's like I told you
If you stay, I'll stay (yeah)

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
(Take it to the back if you really wanna talk)
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
(Take it to the back if you really wanna talk)
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

"Art Deco"

Club queen on the downtown scene
Prowling around at night
You're not mean, you're just born to be seen
Born to be wild
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
You want in but you just can't win
So you hang in the lights

You're so Art Deco, out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them

'Cause you want more (Why)
You want more (Why)
You want more (Why)
'Cause you want more

Young thing on the downtown scene
Rolling around at night
Got things that have yet to be seen
Like your rapper's delight
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
You want in, but you just can't win
So you stay in the lights

You're so Art Deco, out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them

'Cause you want more (Why)
You want more (Why)
You want more (Why)
'Cause you want more

A little party never hurt no one
So we stay out late
A little party never hurt no one
That's what your friends say
You put your life out on the line
You're crazy all the time
Put your life out on the line
You're crazy all the time

You're so Art Deco, out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them

'Cause you want more (Why)
You want more (Why)
You want more (Why)
'Cause you want more

A little party never hurt no one
Not you and me
A little party never hurt no one
We were born to be free

"Burnt Norton (Interlude)"

Time present and time past
Are both perhaps present in time future
And time future contained in time past
If all time is eternally present
All time is unredeemable
What might have been is an abstraction
Remaining a perpetual possibility
Only in a world of speculation
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present
Footfalls echo in the memory
Down the passage which we did not take
Towards the door we never opened
Into the rose-garden

"Religion"

Everything is fine now
Let sleeping dogs lay
All our minds made up now
All our beds are made
No one's out of time, no
Chips fall wherever they may
Leave it all behind
Let the ocean wash away

It never was about the money or the drugs
For you, there's only love
For you, there's only love
It never was about the party or the clubs
For you, there's only love

'Cause you're my religion, you're how I'm living
When all my friends say I should take some space
Well, I can't envision that for a minute
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray

Hallelujah, I need your love
Hallelujah, I need your love

Everything is bright now
No more cloudy days
Even when the storms come
In thee, I will stay
No need to survive now
All we do is play
All I hear is music
Like Lay Lady Lay

It never was about the money or the drugs
With you, there's only love
With you, there's only love
It never was about the party or the clubs
For you, there's only love

'Cause you're my religion, you're how I'm living
When all my friends say I should take some space
Well, I can't envision that for a minute
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray

Hallelujah, I need your love
Hallelujah, I need your love

You're my religion, you're how I'm living
When all my friends say I should take some space
Well, I can't envision that for a minute
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray

Hallelujah, I need your love
Hallelujah, I need your love

"Salvatore"

All the lights in Miami begin to gleam
Ruby, blue and green, neon too
Everything looks better from above, my king
Like aquamarine, ocean's blue

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Cacciatore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Limousines
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ciao, amore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Soft ice cream

All the lights are sparkling for you it seems
On the downtown scenes, shady blue
Beatboxing and rapping in the summer rain
Like a boss, you sang jazz and blues

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Cacciatore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Limousines
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ciao, amore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Soft ice creams

The summer's wild and I've been waiting for you all this time
I adore you, can't you see you're meant for me
The summer's hot but I've been cold without you
I was so wrong not to doubt your Medelln, tangerine dreams

Catch me if you can, working on my tan
Salvatore
Dying by the hand of a foreign man happily
Calling out my name in the summer rain
Ciao, amore
Salvatore can wait
Now it's time to eat soft ice cream

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Cacciatore
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Limousines
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ciao amore
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Soft ice cream

"The Blackest Day"

Carry me home, got my blue nail polish on
It's my favorite color and my favorite tone of song
"I don't really wanna break up, we got it going on"
It's what you gathered from my talk, but you were wrong

It's not easy for me to talk about
I have heavy heartstrings
I'm not simple, it's trigonometry
It's hard to express
I can't explain

Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day
It's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

Because I'm going deeper and deeper (Deeper)
Harder and harder (Harder)
Getting darker and darker
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh, my God
In all the wrong places
Oh, my God

Carry me home, got my new coat and my gun
Wind in my hair, holding your hand, listening to our song
Carry me home, don't wanna talk about the things to come
Just put your hands up in the air, the radio on

'Cause there's nothing for us to talk about
Like the future and those things
'Cause there's nothing for me to think about
Now that he's gone, I can't feel nothing

Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day
It's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

Because I'm going deeper and deeper (Deeper)
Harder and harder (Harder)
Getting darker and darker
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh, my God
In all the wrong places
Oh, my God

You should've known better
Than to have, to let her
Get you under her spell of the weather
I got you where I want you
You're deader than ever
And falling for forever
I'm playing head games with you
Got you where I want you
I got you, I got you
I got you where I want you now

Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day
It's been the blackest day
And all I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

It's not one of those phases I'm going through
Or just a song, it's not one of them
I'm on my own
On my own
On my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again

"24"

There's only 24 hours in a day
And half as many ways for you to lie to me, my little love
There's only 24 hours in a day
And half of those, you lay awake
With thoughts of murder and carnage

If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the company you keep

There's only 24 hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie
Or love like you love

There's only 24 hours in a day
And half of those you lay
Between the sheets with me, my lying love
There's only 24 hours, so you'd say
For most of them you pay
For all the things they paid you for, my love

If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the ones you choose to leave

There's only 24 hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie
Or love like you love

Give me your heat
Give me your diamonds
You hit that street
And my crooked words
You count to three
While they're all dying
You're hard to reach
You're cold to touch

"Swan Song"

Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Why work so hard when you could just be free
You got your money now, you got your legacy
Let's leave the world for the ones who change everything

Nothing could stop
The two of us
Let's just get lost
That's what we want

And I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
I will never sing again
With just one wave, it goes away
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan song

Dive in, dive deep and dive blue, my sweet
Rushing up from the water where the ice meets
And you've been gone so long, you missed everything
The world can change in a day if you go away

But nothing could stop
The two of us
If that's what we want
We could just get lost

And I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
I will never sing again
With just one wave, it goes away
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan song

Do you like
Do you like where you've been and where you're going to
(Going to)
Say goodnight
Say goodnight to the life and the world you knew
I'm gonna follow you

And I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
And I will never sing again
You won't work another day
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan song

Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Why you work so hard when you could just be free

"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"

Baby, you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood

You know sometimes, baby, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes, again, it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never meant to take it out on all you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do

'Cause I love you
Oh baby, I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone
Sometimes I find myself alone, regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done

'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood

"Love"

Look at you, kids, with your vintage music
Coming through satellites while cruising
You're part of the past, but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusing

It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes it's enough just to make you feel crazy

You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter 'cause it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah

Look at you, kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues, but
That don't mean that you should abuse it

Though it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
I know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy

But you get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
It don't matter because it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah

Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby

And it's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy
It's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy

I get ready, I get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
It doesn't matter if I'm not enough
For the future or the things to come
'Cause I'm young and in love, ah, ah
I'm young and in love, ah, ah, ah, ah

Hmm (Ah, ah)

Don't worry, baby

"Lust For Life"
(feat. The Weeknd)

Climb up the H of the Hollywood sign (Yeah)
In these stolen moments, the world is mine (Doo-wop, doo-wop)
There's nobody here, just us together (Sha-doop, sha-doop)
Keeping me hot like July forever
'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
There's no way for us to come late
'Cause boy, we're gold, boy, we're gold
And I was like

Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all of your clothes
They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight (Yeah)

And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive

(Then) We dance on the H of the Hollywood sign (Yeah)
'Til we run out of breath, gotta dance 'til we die (Doo-wop, doo-wop)
My boyfriend's back and he's cooler than ever (Sha-doop, sha-doop)
There's no more night, blue skies forever
'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
So there's no need for us to hesitate
We're all alone, let's take control
And I was like

Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all of your clothes
They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight (Yeah)

And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive (Oh)

My boyfriend's back and he's cooler than ever
There's no more night, blue skies forever
I told you twice in our love letter
There's no stopping now, green lights forever
And I was like

Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all of your clothes

And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive (Oh)

"13 Beaches"

I don't belong in the world
That's what it is
Something separates me from other people
Everywhere I turn
There's something blocking my escape

It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally it's mine
With dripping peaches
I'm camera ready
Almost all the time

But I still get lonely
And baby only then
Do I let myself recline
Can I let go
And let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

It hurts to love you
But I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying
If I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dying
For something real
That I've been dying
For something real

It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally I'm fine
Past Ventura
And lenses plenty
In the white sunshine

But you still can find me
If you ask nicely
Underneath the pines
With the daisies
Feeling hazy
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

It hurts to love you
But I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying
If I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dying
For something real
That I've been dying
For something real

It hurts to love you
But I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying
If I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
The fact that I can't deal

"Cherry"

Love (Yeah), I said real love is like feeling no fear
When you're standing in the face of danger (Hey)
'Cause you just want it so much
A touch (Yeah) from your real love
Is like heaven taking the place of something evil (Hey)
And letting it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah (Fuck)

Darling, darling, darling
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces
My cherries (Hey) and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined

Love (Yeah), is it real love
It's like smiling when the firing squad's against ya (Hey)
And you just stay lined up, yeah (Fuck)

Darling, darling, darling
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces (Bitch)
My cherries (Hey) and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches (Can I get a fucking hallelujah)
Are ruined (Bitch) (Looking at me like a magazine)

My rose garden dreams (Can I get a fucking hallelujah)
Set on fire by fiends (Sipping on ya like a Coca-Cola)
And all my black beaches (Can I get a fucking hallelujah)
Are ruined (Looking at me like a magazine)
My celluloid scenes (Can I get a fucking hallelujah)
Are torn at the seams (Sipping on ya like a Coca-Cola, yeah)
And I fall to pieces (Bitch)
(Yeah) I fall to pieces when I'm with you

(Why) 'Cause I love you so much (Hey)
I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme (Yeah)
And all of my peaches are ruined (Bitch)
Are ruined (Bitch), are ruined (Fuck)

"White Mustang"

Packing all my things for the summer
Lying on my bed, it's a bummer
'Cause I didn't call when I got your number
But I liked you a lot
Slipping on my dress in soft filters
Everybody said you're a killer
But I couldn't stop the way I was feeling
The day your record dropped

The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang

Caught up in my dreams and forgetting
I've been acting like Armageddon 'cause you
Held me in your arms just a little too tight
That's what I thought
Summer's meant for loving and leaving
I was such a fool for believing that you
Could change all the ways you've been living
But you just couldn't stop

The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang

You're revving and revving and revving it up
And the sound, it was frightening
And you were getting a part of that
You're gonna hit me like lightning

White Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Said, you're a wild mustang

You're gonna hit me like lightning
You're gonna hit me like lightning

To say what you wanna say

"Groupie Love"
(feat. A$AP Rocky)

You're in the bar, playing guitar
I'm trying not to let the crowd next to me
It's so hard sometimes with a star
When you have to share him with everybody
You're in the club, living it up
I'm trying not to let the crowd notice me
It's so sweet, swinging to the beat
When I know that you're doing it all for me

And every time you look up
I know what you're thinking of
I know what you're thinking of

You want my
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love

Time after time, writing my lines
Having my baby there next to me
It's so sweet, pouring you a drink
And pretending that nothing means anything
This is my life, you by my side
Key lime and perfume and festivals
Taking our dreams, turning them to things
It's like magic, babe, isn't life wonderful

And every time we hook up
I know what you're thinking of
I know what you're thinking of

You want my
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love

Front row, every show like a hype man
Sing along, word for word, watching my bae
Side stage, fans screaming causing migraines
Yamborghini-high, but she ain't on my grade
God dang, got a nigga acting irate
My babe, my babe, stay on my brain
My babe, made me sing to a fire escape
City girl, but she grew up in the tri-state
She ain't got no time for no groupie love
We don't pay no minds to the thug with a-
Love girls, you and I, so who do we trust
You and I 'til the day we die

Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
You are my babe
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love

"In My Feelings"

I'm smoking while I'm running on my treadmill
But I'm coming up roses
Could it be that I fell for another loser
I'm crying while I'm cumming
Making love while I'm making good money
Sobbing in my cup of coffee
'Cause I fell for another loser

Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wasting my time
While you're taking what's mine with the things that you're doing
Talk that talk, well, now they all know your name
And there's no coming back from the place that you came
Baby, don't do it

'Cause you got me in my feelings
(Got me feeling so much right now)
Talking in my sleep again
(I'm making no sense at all)
Talking while I'm screaming
(Got me feeling so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch Who's freer than me
You wanna make the switch Be my guest, baby
I'm feeling all my fucking feelings

I'm smoking while I'm running
This town and you better believe it, honey
I'm laughing as I'm taking no prisoners
And taking down names
I'm crying while I'm gunning
In the smoke they can hear me coming
If you were me, and I was you
I'd get out of my way

Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wasting my time while you're taking what's mine
Well, you know what you're doing
Talk that talk, well, now they all know your name
And there's no coming back from the place that you came
Baby, don't do it

'Cause you got me in my feelings
(Got me feeling so much right now)
Talking in my sleep again
(I'm making no sense at all)
Talking while I'm screaming
(Got me feeling so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch Who's freer than me
You wanna make the switch Be my guest, baby
I'm feeling all my fucking feelings

Got me up in this place right now
Making no sense at all
Got me up in this place right now, against the wall
Got me feeling so blue
Making no sense at all
Gotta leave right now

'Cause you got me in my feelings
(Got me feeling so much right now)
Talking in my sleep again
(I'm making no sense at all)
Talking while I'm screaming
(Got me feeling so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch Who's freer than me
You wanna make the switch Be my guest, baby
I'm feeling all my fucking feelings

"Coachella - Woodstock In My Mind"

I was at Coachella
Leaning on your shoulder
Watching your husband swing in time
I guess I was in it
'Cause baby, for a minute
It was Woodstock in my mind
In the next morning
They put out the warning
Tensions were rising over country lines
I turned off the music
Tried to sit and use it
All of the love that I saw that night

'Cause what about all these children
And what about all their parents
And what about all their crowns they wear
In hair so long like mine
And what about all their wishes
Wrapped up like garland roses
Round their little heads
I said a prayer for a third time

I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven (a stairway, stairway to heaven)
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (a stairway)
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (a stairway)
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question

I was at Coachella
Leaning on your shoulder
Watching your husband swing and shine
I'd say he was hella, cool to win them over
Critics can be so mean sometimes
He was on his knees and I thought he was breaking 'em down with his words and his voice divine
Doesn't take a genius to know what you've got going
And to not wanna lose it 'cause they lost their minds

What about all these children
And all their children's children
And why am I even wondering that today
Maybe my contribution
Could be as small as hoping
That words could turn to birds and birds would send my thoughts your way

I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven (a stairway, stairway to heaven)
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (a stairway)
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (a stairway)
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question

A stairway, stairway to heaven
A stairway
Got a million things I wanna say
Like what is it all for Will it be okay
Million things I wanna say
Like what is it all for
Stairway, stairway to heaven
Stairway
Stairway, stairway to heaven
Stairway

"God Bless America - And All The Beautiful Women In It"

Take me as I am
Take me, baby, in stride
Only you can save me tonight
There's nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
You let me in, don't leave me out
Or leave me dry

Even when I'm alone, I'm not lonely
I hear the sweetest melodies (sweetest melodies)
On the fire escapes of the city
Sounds like I am free
It's got me singing

And all the beautiful women in it, may you
Stand proud and strong
Like Lady Liberty shining all night long

Don't see me for what I'm not
Only you can hear me tonight
Keep your light on, babe
I might be standing outside
You let me in, don't leave me out
Or leave me dry

Even walking alone, I'm not worried
I feel your arms all around me (arms around me)
In the air on the streets of the city
Feels like I am free

And all the beautiful women in it, may you
Stand proud and strong

So you'd better believe that nobody can make me feel lonely
Because I hear (sweetest melodies)
Even when you talk that talk with the lights on
I still somehow know that I'll never feel, ever feel lonely
I have no fear
It's got me thinking (yeah)

God bless America
And all the beautiful women in it
God bless America
And all the beautiful people in it
May they stand proud and strong
Like Lady Liberty shining all night long

"When The World Was At War We Kept Dancing"

Girls, don't forget your pearls
And all of your horses
As you make your way across the pond
Girls, don't forget your curls
And all of your corsets
Memorize them in a little song

Shake it up
Throw your hands up and get loose
Cut a rug
Lean into the fucking youth
Choreo
We just want the fucking truth

We just kept dancing
When the world was at war before

And take all of your money
If you find you're in a foreign land
Boys, don't make too much noise
And don't try to be funny
Other people may not understand

Throw your hands up and get loose
Cut a rug
Lean into the fucking youth
Choreo

"Beautiful People Beautiful Problems"
(feat. Stevie Nicks)

Blue is the color of the planet from the view above
Long live our reign, long live our love
Green is the planet from the eyes of a turtle dove
'Til it runs red, runs red with blood

We get so tired and we complain
'Bout how it's hard to live
It's more than just a video game

But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
But we gotta try (la la la)
Every day and night (la la la)

Blue is the collar of the shirt of the man I love
He's hard at work, hard to the touch
But warm is the body of the girl from the land he loves
My heart is soft, my past is rough

But when I love him get a feeling
Something close to like a sugar rush
It runs through me
But is it wasted love
(It's not wasted love)

But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
But we gotta try (la la la)
Every day and night (la la la)

Yeah, we've gotta try (la la la)
We gotta walk through fire (la la la)
Because we're just

Beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah

Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
(Beautiful people)
Beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
(We're just)
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them

So beautiful
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

"Tomorrow Never Came"
(feat. Sean Lennon)

"Hey, what you doing" Not a lot
Shaking and moving at my local spot
Baby, don't ask me why, don't ask me why
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why

Lay, lady, lay on that side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay
And I'd be your tiny dancer, honey

I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the middle of the pouring rain
'Cause I adored you
I just wanted things to be the same
You said to meet me up there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came

Hey, what you thinking Penny for your thoughts
Those lights are blinking on that old jukebox
But don't ask me why, just swallow some wine
Wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wine

Stay, baby, stay on the side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay
And you'd be my tiny dancer, baby

I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the middle of the pouring rain
'Cause I adored you
And I just wanted things to be the same
You said you'd meet me up there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came

Roses out in your country house
We played guitar in your barn
And everyday felt like Sunday
And I, I wish we had stayed home
And I could put on the radio to our favorite song
Lennon and Yoko, we would play all day long
"Isn't life crazy", I said now that I'm singing with Sean
Whoa

I could keep waiting for you
In the spot we always wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the summer, on the pouring rain
Honey, don't ignore me
I just wanted it to be the same
You said you'd love me like no tomorrow
I guess tomorrow never came (No, no, no)
Tomorrow never came (No, no)
Tomorrow never came (No, no, no)
Tomorrow never came

"Heroin"

Topanga is hot tonight, the city by the bay
Has movie stars and liquor stores and soft decay
The rumbling from distant shores sends me to sleep
But the facts of life, can sometimes make it hard to dream

Life rocked me like Mtley
Grabbed me by the ribbons in my hair
Life rocked me, ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you wear

I'm flying to the moon again
Dreaming about heroin
How it gave you everything
And took your life away
I put you on an aeroplane
Destined for a foreign land
I hoped that you'd come back again
And tell me everything's
Okay eh, eh, babe, yeah

Topanga is hot today
Manson's in the air
And all my friends have gone
'Cause they still feel him here
I want to leave
I'll probably stay another year
It's hard to leave when absolutely nothing's clear

Life rocked me like Mtley
Bad beginning to my new year
Life rocked me, ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you hear

I'm flying to the moon again
Dreaming about heroin
And how it gave you everything
And took your life away
I put you on the aeroplane
Destined for a foreign land
I thought that you'd come back again
To tell me everything's
Okay eh, eh, babe, yeah

It's fucking hot, hot
Winter in the city
Something 'bout this weather made these kids go crazy
It's hot, even for February
Something 'bout this sun has made these kids get scary
Oh, writing in blood on my walls and shit
Like
Oh, oh my God
Jumping off from the walls into the docks and shit
Oh, ho ho ho, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sick of it
Lead me baby
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on

I'm flying to the moon again
Dreaming about marzipan
Taking all my medicine
To take my thoughts away
I'm getting on that aeroplane
Leaving my old man again
I hope that I come back one day
To tell you that I
Really changed
Baby

It's hot, hot
Something 'bout the city
Don't know what it is
It makes my head get crazy
Oh, oh, oh
Makes me feel like I can change
Oh, hoh, hoh, hoh
All of my evil ways and shit
Hmm, hmm
Oh, oh, oh
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sick of it

"Change"

There's something in the wind, I can feel it blowing in
It's coming in softly on the wings of a bomb
There's something in the wind, I can feel it blowing in
It's coming in hotly and it's coming in strong

Lately, I've been thinking it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn
I've been thinking it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to wanna try But

Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings
Trying to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it coming in me
Maybe by the time summer's done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holding you in my arms without letting you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are, because

Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for it

There's something in the wind, I can feel it blowing in
It's coming in softly on the wings of a song
There's something in the water, I can taste it turning sour
It's bitter, I'm coughing, but now it's in my blood

Lately, I've been thinking it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn
I've been thinking it's just someone else's job to care
'Cause who am I to wanna try But

Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings
Trying to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it coming in me
Maybe by the time summer's done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holding you in my arms without letting you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are, because

Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for it

Yeah, whenever it does, we'll be here for it
Whenever it does, we'll be here for it

"Get Free"

Finally
I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world
To the reveal of my heart
Undoubtedly
That will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea
And the darkness from the arts

This is my commitment
My modern manifesto
I'm doing it for all of us
Who never got the chance
For... and for... (Shut up, shut up)
And all my birds of paradise (Shut up, shut up)
Who never got to fly at night (Shut up, shut up)
'Cause they were caught up in the dance

Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep riding the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)

Finally
Gone is the burden
Of the Crowley way of being
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was I
Was not discerning
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mind

There's no more chasing rainbows
And hoping for an end to them
Their arches are illusions
Solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them (Touch, touch)
There's nothing to hold on to (Hold, hold)
The colors used to lure you in (Shut up, shut up)
And put you in a trance (Ah, ah, ah, yeah)

Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep riding the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)

"Norman Fucking Rockwell"

Goddamn, man-child
You fucked me so good that I almost said, "I love you"
You're fun and you're wild
But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
But I can't change that, and I can't change your mood
Ah-ah

'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue, blue

Goddamn, man-child
You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
Self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Canyon know-it-all
You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you
But I don't get bored, I just see it through
Why wait for the best when I could have you
You-oh-oh

'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue

You make me blue
Blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue

"Mariners Apartment Complex"

You took my sadness out of context
At the Mariners Apartment Complex
I ain't no candle in the wind
I'm the board, the lightning, the thunder
Kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
Who you are and who you've been

And who I've been is with you on these beaches
Your Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
Maybe I could save you from your sins
So kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus
My, my, my, you found this, you need this
Take a deep breath, baby, let me in

You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

They mistook my kindness for weakness
I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
Can't a girl just do the best she can
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Think about it, the darkness, the deepness
All the things that make me who I am

And who I am is a big-time believer
That people can change, but you don't have to leave her
When everyone's talking, you can make a stand
'Cause even in the dark, I feel your resistance
You can see my heart burning in the distance
Baby, baby, baby, I'm your man (Yeah)

You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Take in the sweetness
You want this, you need this
Are you ready for it
Are you ready for it
Are you ready for it

"Venice Bitch"

Fear fun, fear love
Fresh out of fucks forever
Trying to be stronger for you
Ice cream, ice queen
I dream in jeans and leather
Live stream, I'm sweet for you

Oh God, miss you on my lips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Calling out, bang bang, kiss kiss

You're in the yard, I light the fire
And as the summer fades away
Nothing gold can stay
You write, I tour, we make it work
You're beautiful and I'm insane
We're American-made

Give me Hallmark
One dream, one life, one lover
Paint me happy in blue
Norman Rockwell
No hype under our covers
It's just me and you

Oh God, miss you on my lips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Calling out, bang bang, kiss kiss

You're in the yard, I light the fire
And as the summer fades away
Nothing gold can stay
You write, I tour, we make it work
You're beautiful and I'm insane
We're American-made

Oh (Yeah), oh (Yeah), oh (Yeah)
Sounding off, bang bang, kiss kiss
Oh (Yeah), oh (Yeah), oh (Yeah)
Sounding off, bang bang, kiss kiss

Oh God, want you on my lips (I do, I do)
It's me, your little Venice bitch (Yes, it is)
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Sounding off, bang bang, kiss kiss

Oh, shatter (Yeah), oh, shatter (Yeah, yeah), oh, shatter (Yeah)
(Sounding off, bang bang, kiss kiss)
Yeah (Yeah), oh (Yeah), oh (Yeah)
(Sounding off, bang bang, kiss kiss)
Yeah, yeah

You heard my baby's back in town now
You should come, come over
We'll be hanging around now
You should come, come over

Oh God, I love him on my lips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
Touch me with your fingertips
It's me, your little Venice bitch

Back, back in the garden
We're getting high now because we're older
Me myself, I like diamonds
My baby, crimson and clover

(La-la-la-la-la-la, losers, beautiful losers)
(La-la-la-la-la-la, losers, beautiful, losers)
Wha-wha-wha-wha-whatever

Over and over, honey

If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your love

"Fuck It I Love You"

I like to see everything in neon
Drink lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Maybe the way that I'm living is killing me
I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But one day I woke up like
"Maybe I'll do it differently"

So I moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
It turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It's killing me slowly

Dream a little dream of me
Make me into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do

I used to shoot up my veins in neon
And shit's even brighter you're gone
So many things I would say to you
I want you

You moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
And you know everyone adores you
You can't feel it and you're tired
Baby, wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
But it's killing me slowly

Dream a little dream of me
Turn this into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do

It turns out California's more than just a state of mind
I met you on the boulevard, braids in my hair, you blew my mind
And if I wasn't so fucked up, I think I'd fuck you all the time
(I really do)
It's killing me slowly

Fuck it, I love you (I moved to California, but it's just a state of mind)
Fuck it, I love you (It turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie)
Fuck it, I love you (Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine)
I really do (It's killing me slowly)

(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreaming, got my money on my mind
(Fuck it, I love you)
Jazz in my veins, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreaming, got my money on my mind
(I really do)
Jazz in my veins, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreaming, got my money on my mind
(Fuck it, I love you)
Jazz in my veins, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreaming, got my money on my mind
(I really do)
Jazz in my veins, running out of time

"Love Song"

In the car, in the car, in the backseat, I'm your baby
We go fast, we go so fast, we don't move
I believe in a place you take me
Make you real proud of your baby
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burning through you
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burning through you

Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lying on your chest in my party dress
I'm a fucking mess, but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, passed the test and yes
Now I'm here with you, and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You know that I'd just die to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song

Dream a dream, here's a scene
Touch me anywhere 'cause I'm your baby
Grab my waist, don't waste any part
I believe that you see me for who I am
So spill my clothes on the floor of your new car
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are

Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lying on your chest in my party dress
I'm a fucking mess, but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, passed the test and yes
Now I'm here with you, and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You know that I'd just die to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song

"Cinnamon Girl"

Cinnamon in my teeth
From your kiss, you're touching me
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
You try to push me out, but I just find my way back in
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out, I win

There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did

Kerosene in my hands
You make me mad, on fire again
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work

There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did

There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

"How To Disappear"

John met me down on the boulevard
Cry on his shoulder 'cause life is hard
The waves came in over my head
What you been up to, my baby
Haven't seen you 'round here lately
All of the guys tell me lies, but you don't
You just crack another beer
And pretend that you're still here

This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear

Joe met me down at the training yard
Cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard
I know he's in over his head
But I love that man like nobody can
He moves mountains and pounds them to ground again
I watched the guys getting high as they fight
For the things that they hold dear
To forget the things they fear

This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear

Now it's been years since I left New York
I've got a kid and two cats in the yard
The California sun and the movie stars
I watch the skies getting light as I write
As I think about those years
As I whisper in your ear

I'm always going to be right here
No one's going anywhere

"California"

(One, two, three, four)

You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms, baby
You don't ever have to go faster than your fastest pace
Or faster than my fastest cars

I shouldn't have done it, but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to reach out, but I never said a thing
I shouldn't have done it, but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to call you, but I didn't say a thing
(Two, three, four)

Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever how far
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance 'til dawn
I'll pick up all of your Vogues and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top shelf
I'll throw a party all night long

You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms, and, honey
You don't ever have to act cooler than you think you should
You're brighter than the brightest stars

You're scared to win, scared to lose
I've heard the war was over if you really choose
The one in and around you
You hate the heat, you got the blues
Changing like the weather, oh, that's so like you
The Santa Ana moves you
(Two, three, four)

Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever how far
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance 'til dawn
I'll pick up all of your Vogues and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top shelf
I'll throw a party all night long

Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up

"The Next Best American Record"

My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
To the Houses of the Holy, smoking on them cigarettes
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was cool as heck
He was cool as heck

And we were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
That we gave all we had 'til the time we got to bed
'Cause we knew we could
We were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
'Cause we were just that good
It was just that good

Whatever's on tonight, I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight, I'm taking off my bathing suit
You make me feel like
There's something that I never knew I wanted

My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was '70s in spirit, '90s in his frame of mind
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
We lost track of space
We lost track of time

And we were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
That we gave all we had 'til the time we got to bed
'Cause we knew we could
We were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
'Cause we were just that good
It was just that good

Whatever's on tonight, I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight, I'm taking off my bathing suit
You make me feel like
There's something that I never knew I wanted
We play the Eagles down in Malibu and I want it

It's you, all the roads lead to you
Everything I want and do, all the things that I say
It's true, all the roads lead to you
Like the 405 I drive through
Every night and every day
I see you for who you really are
Why the thousands of girls love
The way Bill plays guitar

Whatever's on tonight, I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight, I'm taking off my bathing suit
You make me feel like
There's something that I never knew I wanted
We play the Eagles down in Malibu and I want it
There's something that I never knew I wanted

"The Greatest"

I miss Long Beach and I miss you, babe
I miss dancing with you the most of all
I miss the bar where the Beach Boys would go
Dennis' last stop before Kokomo

Those nights were on fire
We couldn't get higher
We didn't know that we had it all
But nobody warns you before the fall

And I'm wasted
Don't leave, I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess I'm signing off after all

I miss New York and I miss the music
Me and my friends, we miss rock 'n' roll
I want shit to feel just like it used to
When, baby, I was doing nothing the most of all

The culture is lit, and if this is it, I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all

I'm wasted
Don't leave, I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all

If this is it, I'm signing off
Miss doing nothing the most of all
Hawaii just missed that fireball
L.A. is in flames, it's getting hot
Kanye West is blond and gone
"Life on Mars" ain't just a song
I hope the live stream's almost on

"Bartender"

All the ladies of the canyon
Wearing black to their house parties
Crosby, Stills and Nash is playing
Wine is flowing with Bacardi

But sometimes, girls just want to have fun
The poetry inside of me is warm like a gun

I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo-free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby, remember, I'm not drinking wine
But that Cherry Coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bartender, bar-t-t-tender

All the ladies of the canyon
Wearing white for their tea parties
Playing games of levitation
Meditating in the garden

And I love the little games that we play
From the valley to the beach
And when at last the day is done, I grab my keys

I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo-free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby, remember, I'm not drinking wine
But that Cherry Coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bar-t-t-tender, bar-t-t-tender, bar-t-t-tender
Ha, ha, ha, ha

I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
60 MPH on PCH drive
Here to Long Beach to Newport by your side
As they don't yet know where I reside
60 miles from the last place I hide
With my bar-t-t-tender, hold me all night
Bar-t-t-tender, keep love alive
Bar-t-t-tender

"Happiness Is A Butterfly"

Do you want me or do you not
I heard one thing, now I'm hearing another
Dropped a pin to my parking spot
The bar was hot, it's 2 AM, it feels like summer

Happiness is a butterfly
Try to catch it, like, every night
It escapes from my hands into moonlight
Every day is a lullaby
Hum it on the phone, like, every night
Sing it for my babies on the tour life, ah

If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt

I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you

Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you (Dance)
Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you

Left the canyon, drove to the club
I was one thing, now I'm being another
Laurel down to Sunset in the truck
I'll pick you up if you're in town on the corner, ah

Happiness is a butterfly
We should catch it while dancing
I lose myself in the music, baby
Every day is a lullaby
Try to catch it like lightning
I sing it into my music, I'm crazy

If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt

I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you

Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you (Dance)
Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you

"Hope Is A Dangerous Thing For A Woman Like Me To Have - But I Have It"

I was reading Slim Aarons
And I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed
If I was tested less like all of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses
And high heels on white yachts
But I'm not
Baby I'm not
No, I'm not
That I'm not

I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
247, Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on my walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not
But at best I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing
For a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing
For a woman like me to have

I had fifteen-year dances
Church basement romances yeah I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage which I also call home when I'm not
Serving up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, "Hi dad"

I've been tearing up town in my fucking white gown
Like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's
Got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less and I never cared more
So there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing
For a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing
For a woman with my past

There's a new revolution
A loud evolution
That I saw
Born of confusion
And quiet collusion
Of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman
With a weak constitution
'Cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed
That I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping
The keys on my nights off

I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
247, Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on your walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy, they know that I'm not
But at best you can see I'm not sad
But hope is a dangerous thing
For a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing
For a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing
For a woman like me to have
But I have it
Yeah, I have it
Yeah, I have it
I have

"LA Who Am I To Love You"

I left my city for San Francisco
Took a free ride off a billionaire's jet
LA, I'm from nowhere, who am I to love you
LA, I've got nothing, who am I to love you when I'm feeling this way and I've got nothing to offer
LA, not quite the city that never sleeps
Not quite the city that wakes, but the city that dreams, for sure
If by dreams, you mean in nightmares

LA, I'm a dreamer, but I'm from nowhere, who am I to dream
LA, I'm upset, I have complaints, listen to me
They say I came from money and I didn't
And I didn't even have love, and it's unfair
LA, I sold my life rights for a big check and I'm upset
And now I can't sleep at night and I don't know why
Plus, I love ach, so why did I do that when I know it won't last

LA, I picked San Francisco because the man who doesn't love me lives there
LA, I'm pathetic, but so are you, can I come home now
Daughter to no one, table for one
Party of thousands of people I don't know at Delilah where my ex-husband works
I'm sick of this, but can I come home now
Mother to no one, private jet for one
Back home to the Tudor house that borned a thousand murder plots
Hancock Park, it's treated me very badly, I'm resentful
The witch on the corner, the neighbor nobody wanted
The reason for Garcetti's extra security

LA, I know I'm bad, but I have nowhere else to go, can I come home now
I never had a mother, will you let me make the sun my own for now, and the ocean my son
I'm quite good at tending to things despite my upbringing, can I raise your mountains
I promise to keep them greener, make them my daughters
Teach them about fire, warn them about water
I'm lonely, LA, can I come home now

I left my city for San Francisco
And I'm writing from the Golden Gate Bridge
But it's not going as I planned
I took a free ride off a billionaire and brought my typewriter
And promised myself that I would stay, but
It's just not going the way that I thought
It's not that I feel different, and I don't mind that it's not hot
It's just that I belong to no one, which means there's only one place for me
The city not quite awake, the city not quite asleep
The city that's still deciding how good it can be

And also
I can't sleep without you
No one's ever really held me like you
Not quite tightly, but certainly, I feel your body next to me
Smoking next to me
Vaping lightly next to me
And I love that you love the neon lights like me
Orange in the distance
We both love that
And I love that we have that in common
Also, neither one of us can go back to New York
For you are unmoving
As for me, it won't be my city again until I'm dead
Fuck the New York Post

LA, who am I to need you when I've needed so much, asked for so much
And what I've been given, I'm not sure yet
I may never know that either until I'm dead
For now, though, what I do know
Is although I don't deserve you
Not you at your best and your splendor
With towering eucalyptus trees that sway in my dominion
Not you at your worst
Totally on fire, unlivable, unbreathable, I need you

You see, I have no mother
And you do
A continental shelf
A larger piece of land from where you came
And I
I'm an orphan
A little seashell that rests upon your native shores
One of many, for sure
But because of that, I surely must love you closely to the most of anyone

For that reason, let me love you
Don't mind my desperation
Let me hold you, not just for vacation
But for real and for forever
Make it real life
Let me be a real wife to you
Girlfriend, lover, mother, friend
I adore you
Don't be put off by my quick-wordedness
I'm generally quite quiet
Quite a meditator, actually
I'll do very well down by Paramhansa Yogananda's realization center, I'm sure
I promise you'll barely even notice me
Unless you want to notice me
Unless you prefer a rambunctious child
In which case, I can turn it on too
I'm quite good on the stage as you may know
You might have heard of me

So either way, I'll fit in just fine
So just love me by doing nothing
And perhaps, by not shaking the county line
I'm yours if you'll have me
But regardless, you're mine

"The Land Of 1000 Fires"

Two blue steel trains run through the tunnels of your cool blue steel eyes
Vernon
Rock quarry
The vastness of which has nothing on your beautiful mind
Dylan
I hear Dylan when I look at you
I can see it in invisible ink like a tattoo
The ying to my yang
The toughness to my unending softness
A striking example of masculinity
Firm in your verticality
Sure in your confrontation against all elements
And duality
The sun to my wilting daisy
The earth to the wildflower that doesn't care where it grows

Vernon
Everything's burnt here
There's no escaping it
The air is fried and on fire
I've never really fallen in love
But whatever this feeling is
I wish everyone could experience it
This place feels like a person
Familiar
Like someone I've stood next to before
But never while I was standing next to you
Thank you
For being here
For bearing witness to my vastness

Through the year I've called you in and out of my orbit
You, in your madness
The satellite that constellates my world
Mimicking the inner chaos that I've disowned
A mirror to my past life retributions
And a reflection of my sadness
If I'm going to keep on living the way that I'm living
I can't do it without you
My feet aren't on the ground
I need your body to stand on
Your name to define me
On top of being a woman
I am scared
And
Ethereal
And

There are seven worlds in my eyes

I'm accessing of all them once

One to draw my words from and my muses
Another one I try and harness late at night that lies somewhere
Off of the right of Jupiter
And then of course there's this one I live in
The land of a thousand fires
That's where you come in

You
Vernon
Dylan
Two blue steel trains
Running through the tunnels of your
Cool blue steel eyes

To guide me far from the world of my early days
That I can't quite make out clearly
That beckon me towards high sea cliffs
On long car rides

Towards a future place
A world unknown to me
Made up of something surreal and dripping
Flowers in solar systems oversized

You Vernon Dylan

No words needed to sponge up the
Dark nights
No explanations for the globes in my eyes
Shoulder to shoulder in the factory light
Letting me be who I would have been
If everything had turned out alright

Three alternative endings
Now course through my blood on ice
But I thrive because I say I do
And because it's what I write

But honestly if you weren't here with me
I don't know what things would look like

That's my why no matter what world I'm in
I'm accessible by only one satellite
Vernon
Dylan
And you in your madness

With two blue steel trains running
Through your cool blue steel eyes

"Violet Bent Backwards Over The Grass"

I went to a party
I came in hot
Made decisions beforehand
My mind made up
Things that would make me happy
To do them or not
Each option weighed carefully
A plan for each thought
And then I walked through the door past the open concept
And saw Violet bent backwards over the grass
Seven years old with dandelions grasped tightly in her hand
Arched like a bridge in a fallen handstand
Grinning wildly like a madman
With the exuberance that only doing nothing can bring
Waiting for the fireworks to begin
And in that moment I decided to do nothing about everything

"Past The Bushes Cypress Thriving"

I saw you in the mirror
You were wearing your hair differently
Carrying the air differently
You said you wear your hair long parted in the middle
Long in solidarity just like all his women

In Long Beach

Aimless

Your fingers wiping oil on the paper with precision
With decision like an artist never seen yet with a vision

With a reason
Stared with venom at the ceiling
Not the grass
But straight ahead
Just At the skyline
With precision
Laser vision

Time was stopping
Moving through you
You dictated
By what moved you

Only moving never thinking

Match the sun that's slowly sinking
At the height of the afternoon
In the heat of the summer evening
Like a phoenix like a chem trail like a wavelength No
One's claiming

Georgia o Keefe
Georgia peaches
Doing nothing but your painting
For forever
Forget teachers
Forgive him for ever leaving

Love is rising
No resisting
Cheeks are flushing
Now you're living

Say goodbye now
No resisting
Live your life like
No one's listening

Be the art the life is breathing
Be the soul the world is living

For you only
Not for giving
Just for taking
No one's listening

At the end of Rose and Rich
Down the street that's green and winding
Past the bushes cypress thriving
Past the chain link fence and driving
Further down the road less travelled
There you are athleisure wear unraveled
Now I see you clear

Standing stoic blue and denim
Eyes not blue but clear like
Heaven

You don't want to be forgotten

You just want to disappear

"Salamander"

Get out of my blood, salamander
I can't seem to blow off enough steam to get you out of my head
Soul cycle you to death, run you out of my blood to San Pedro
And yet, everywhere I go, it seems there you are
And there I am

I don't want to sell my stories anymore, stop pushing me
Some stories aren't meant to be sold
Some words aren't meant to be told

I want to leave them underneath the nightstand to be forgotten
Or remembered should my thoughts come upon them in the middle of the night after a long beach day
Or by you, some afternoon, to thumb through with your worn warm after-work hands
I love you, but you don't understand me, I'm a real poet
My life is my poetry, my love making is my legacy
My thoughts are about nothing, and beautiful, and for free

You see, the things that can't be bought can't be evaluated, and that makes them beyond human reach
Untouchable, safe, otherworldly
Unable to be deciphered or metabolized

Something metaphysical
Like a view of the sea on a summer day on the most perfect winding road taken in from the car window

A thing perfect, and ready to become a part of the texture of the fabric of something more ethereal

Like Mount Olympus, where eus sent Athena and the rest of the immortals to play

"Never To Heaven"

May my eyes always stay level to the horizon
May they never gaze as high as heaven, to ask why
May I never go where angels fear to tread
So as to have to ask for answers in the sky
The whys in this lifetime I've found are inconsequential
Compared to the magic of the nowness - the solution to most questions
There are no reasons

And if there are - I'm wrong
But at least I won't have spent my life waiting
Looking for God in the clouds of the dawn

I'll be up early to rise though of course
But only to make you a pot of coffee

That's what I was thinking this morning Joe
That it's times like this as the marine layer lifts
Off the sea from the view of our favorite restaurant
That I pray that I may
Always keep my eyes level to your eyeline
Never downcast at the table cloth

You see, Joe
It's times like this that the marine layer lifts
Off the sea on the dock with out candle lit
That I think to myself
There are things you still don't know about me
Like sometimes I'm afraid my sadness is too big
And that one day you might have to help me handle it

But until then
May my eyes always stay level to the skyline
Assessing Long Beach's glittering new development
Never higher than the tallest building
Never to heaven or revenant
'Cause I have faith in man as strange as that seems
In times like these
And it's not just because of the warmth I've found in your
Brown eyes
It's because I believe in the goodness in me
That it's firm enough to plant a flag in
Or a
Rosebud
Or to build a new life

"SportCruiser"

I took a flying lesson on my 33rd birthday, instead of calling you
Or parking on the block where our old place used to be

Genesee, genesee, genesee

Pathetic, I know  but sometimes I still like to park on that street
And have lunch in the car just to feel close to you

I was once in love with my life here
In that studio apartment with you
Little yellow flowers on the tops of trees as our only view
Out of the only window
Big enough for me to see our future through
But it turned out I was the only one who could see it

Stupid apartment complex
Terrible you
You, who I wait for
You, you, you
Like a broken record stuck on loop

So that day, on my birthday, I thought
"Something has to change"
You can't always be about waiting for you

Don't tell anyone, but part of my reasoning for taking the flight class, was this idea that if I could become my own navigator
The captain of the sky
That perhaps I could stop looking for direction
From you

Well, what started off as an idea on a whim
Has turned into something more
Too shy to explain to the owners that my first lesson was just a one-time thing
I've continued to go to classes each week
At the precious little strip off Santa Monica and Bundy

And everything was going fine
We were starting with dips and loops
And then something terrible happened

During my fourth lesson in the sky
My instructor, younger than I, but as tough as you
Instructed me to do a simple maneuver
It's not that I didn't do it
But I was slow to lean the sports cruiser into a right-hand upward turn
Scared, scared that I would lose control of the plane

Not tactfully and not gently
The instructor shook his head, and without looking at me said
"You don't trust yourself"

I was horrified
Feeling as though I'd somehow been found out
Like he knew me
How weak I was
Of course, he was only talking about my ability as a pilot in the sky
But I knew it was meant for me to hear those words

For me, they held a deeper meaning
I didn't trust myself

Not just 2500 feet above the coast of Malibu
But with anything
And I didn't trust you

I could've said something but I was quiet
Because pilots aren't like poets
They don't make metaphors between life and the sky

In the midst of this mid-life, meltdown, navigational exercise in self-examination
I also decided to do something else I had always wanted to do
Take sailing lessons in the vibrant bay of Marina del Rey
I signed up for the class as "Elizabeth Grant"
And nobody blinked an eye

So, why was I so sure that when I walked into the tiny shack on Valley Way, someone would say
"You're not a captain of a ship, or the master of the sky"
No, the fisherman didn't care, and so neither did I

And for a brief moment, I felt more myself than ever before

Letting the self proclaimed drunkard captain's lessons wash over me like the foamy tops of the sea

Midway through my forehead burned
And my hands raw from driving
The captain told me the most important thing I would need to know on the sea

"Never run the ship into irons"
That's nautical terms for not sailing the boat directly into the wind

In order to do that though, you have to know where the wind is coming from

And you might not have time to look up to the mast
Or up further to the weathervane
So you have to feel where the wind is coming from
On your cheeks, and by the tips of the white waves from which direction they're rolling

To do this, he gave me an exercise
He told me to close my eyes, and asked me to feel on my neck which way the wind was blowing
I already knew I was going to get it wrong
"The wind is coming from everywhere, I feel it all over" I told him
"No", he said, "the wind is coming from the left. The portside"
I sat waiting for him to tell me "You don't trust yourself"

But he didn't, so I said it for him
"I don't trust myself"

He laughed gentler than the pilot, but still not realising that my failure in the exercise was hitting me at a much deeper level

"It's not that you don't trust yourself" he said. "it's simply that you're not a captain. It isn't what you do"

Then he told me he wanted me to practise everyday so I would get better

"Which grocery store do you go to" he asked
"To the Ralphs in the Palisades" I replied

"OK. When you're in the Ralphs in the Palisades
I want you, as you're walking from your car to the store
To close your eyes, and feel which way the wind is blowing
Now, I don't want you to look like a crazy person crouching in the middle of the parking lot
But everywhere you go
I want you to try and find which way the wind is coming in from
And then, determine if it's from the port or starboard side
So when you're back on the boat you have a better sense of it"

I thought his advice was adorable
I could already picture myself in the parking lot
Squinting my eyes with perfect housewives looking on

I could picture myself growing a better sense of which way the wind was blowing
And as I did, a tiny bit of deeper trust also began to grow within myself
I thought of mentioning it
But I didn't
Because captain's aren't like poets
They don't make metaphors between the sea and the sky

And as I thought that to myself
I realized
That's why I write

All of this circumnavigating the earth
Was to get back to my life
Six trips to the moon for my poetry to arise

I'm not a captain
I'm not a pilot
I write
I write

"Tessa DiPietro"

No one ever touched me without wanting to kill me
Except for a healer on 6th street in Ridgely
Tessa DiPietro,
Recommended casually by a medium I no longer know

She said my number-one problem was that my field was untrusting
When asked what to do, she paused and said nothing
Which sent me right into uncontrollable sobbing

Because there's never anything you can do about the important things

She said "Okay, one thing you can do is picture the floor rising up to support you,
And sink into the back of the bed that's behind you
Too much of your energy is in front and above you"

Which, for some reason, made me think of a live show I'd seen
Jim Morrison at the Hollywood Bowl, 1968, check date

The blue trellis lights gave him an unusual aura
Like a halo or something
Made him 8 feet or taller

I remember just thinking he looked out of his body
But definitely like a god on stage

So I told her "Maybe an artist has to function a little bit above themselves,
If they really want to transmit some heaven"

And she told me
"A singleness of focus is the key to transmission,
For an emphasis on developing inner intuition,
Close your eyes and feel where you hold your attention

If it's in the back of your eyes
Walk it down to your heart's centre
And make that the new place from which your thoughts enter

Clairvoyance comes mostly from this simple function
Oh - and Jim died at 27
So find another frame of reference
When you're referencing heaven

And have you ever read the lyrics to 'People are Strange'
He made no sense"

"Quiet Waiter Blue Forever"

You move like water sweet baby sweet waiter
Making the night smile to no one you cater
Silent wood worker from midnight till later
My lover my laughter my armor my maker
The way that I feel with you is something like aching
Inside of my stomach the cosmos are baking
A universe hung like a mobile
The alignment of these planets unique
In me the earth moves around the sun
No land all sea
Water world
Sun chaser
Tropic of cancer
Southern equater
I'm the crying crustacean
Sunbathing on paper
Moon
Let's rewrite the beginning of this primordial ooze
Shall we my love
Am I being brazen for saying this year makes me feel
Like we could've wrote it better
Than him
But who am I
Just a girl in love dreaming on paper
Rearranging the salt for the pepper
In love with you
My quiet waiter
Summer
Blue
Forever
Call me when you're done with work
I'll pick you up later
The darker the better

"What Happened When I Left You"

Perfect petals punctuate the fabrics yellow blue
Silver platters with strawberries strewn across the room

In immerman with sandals on one summer dress to choose

Three girls
Eyes rolled
Loud laughter
Dust specs lit by afternoon

My life is sweet like lemonade now there's no bitter fruit
Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
No thought of you

My thoughts have changed
My voice is higher
Now I'm over you

No flickering in my head movies
Projected in Bellevue

Because I captured the mood of my wish fulfilled
And sailed to anadu

The grief that came in waves that rolled I navigated through

The fire from my wish as wind to future trip to Malibu

Now everything I have is perfect
Nothing much to do

Just perfect florals
Green embroidered chairs
One dress to choose

"Happy"

You thought I was rich
And I am but not how you think
I live in a Tudor house
Under the freeway in Mar Vista by the beach
When you call I take my phone to the picnic table
That I bought from the Rose Bowl
And I listen to the rushing cars above
And I think about the last time you visited me
The last time we made love
How the noise got louder and louder during rush hour
Until it sounded like the sea
And it felt like the ocean was the sky
And that I was flying because you were two feet taller than me
Until you took me in your arms
And I could touch the stars
And they all fell down around my head
And I became an angel
And you put me to bed
Happy

People think that I'm rich and I am but not how they think
I have a truck with a gold key chain in the ignition
And on the back it says happy, joyous, and free
Happy
And when I drive
I think about the last time my friends were driving with me
How the radio was so loud that I couldn't hear the words
So we became the music
Happy

They write that I'm rich and I am but not how they think
I have a safe I call the boyfriend box
And in it every saved receipt
Every movie theater ticket just to remind me
Of all the things I've loved and lost and loved again
Unconditionally
Happy

You joke that I'm rich and I am but not how you think
I live in a Tudor house under the freeway
Off of Rose Avenue, 12 blocks from the beach
And when you call I put your sweater on
And put you on speaker
And chat for hours underneath the trees
And think about the last time you were here lying next to me
How the noise from the cars got louder and louder
During rush hour
Until it sounded like a river or a stream
And it felt like we were swimming
But it wasn't just a dream
We were just

Happy

"My Bedroom Is A Sacred Place Now  There Are Children At The Foot Of My Bed"

Last year, when I wrote you my last letter
The beginning of my future poetry
I acknowledged who you really were for the first time

I didn't call you by any other name
I let you know that I knew the true nature of your heart
That it was evil, and that it convinced me that darkness was real
That the devil is a real devil
And that monsters don't always know that they're monsters

But projection is an amazing thing
After you left and burnt the house down
You tried to convince me that it was I who was holding the matches
You told me that I didn't know who I was, but I do

I love rose gardens
I plant violets every time someone leaves me
I love the great sequoias of Yosemite
And if you asked my sister to describe the first thing she thinks of when she thinks of me
She would say "camp fire smoke"

I'm gentle
I'm funny when I'm drunk
But I haven't been drunk for 14 years
I go on trips with my friends to the beach who don't know that I'm crazy
I can do that
I can do anything
Even leave you

Because my bedroom is a sacred place now that there are children at the end of my bed
Telling me stories about the friends that they pretend to hate, that they will make up with later
And there are fresh cut flowers that I grew myself in vases from the yard on nightstands, hand carved by old pals from Big Sur

And the longer I stay here
The more I am sure
But the more I step into becoming a poet
The less I will fall into being with you

The more I step into my poetry
The less I will fall into being with you
The more I step into my poetry
The less I will fall into bed with you

"Paradise Is Very Fragile"

Paradise is very fragile
And it seems like it's only getting worse

Down here in Florida
We're fighting red toxic tides
Mass of fish kills
Not to mention hurricanes and rising sea levels

Back in Los Angeles, things aren't looking much better
My treehouse that'd been standing for 80 years succumbed to the woolsy fire

Who would've thought that this year at 33
You would've been taken out from under me
After all those years

Built from the ground up, by hand, by your very first owner
Quiet World War One, aviation pilot
I tried to save you but the German Shepherd seemed more important

Paradise is very fragile
And it seems like it's only getting worse

Our leader is a megalomaniac
And we've seen that before
But never 'cause it was what the country deserved

My friends tell me to stop calling 911 on the culture
But it's either that or I 5150 myself

They don't understand
I'm a dreamer
And I had big dreams for the country
Not for what it could do, but how it could feel
How it could think, how it could dream

I know
Who am I to dream for you
It's just that in my own mind
I was born with a little bit of paradise
I was lucky in that way
Not like my husband
Who was born and raised in hell

I always had something gentle to give
All of me, in fact
It's one of the beautiful things about me
It's one of the beautiful things about nature

But lately I've been thinking that I wish
Someone had told me when I was younger
More about the inhabitants that thrive off of paradise

That should they take too much
There would be nothing left to give
Not everyone's nature is golden and green
And you can't fight what's in your nature

I got to thinking about it as
We were fighting the fires in Agora
But I'm tired of fighting you

Paradise is very fragile
And it's only getting worse

And every time I think of that
I think about the curse bestowed upon Eve, that fateful eve
She took that bite of fruit from that fruitful tree
And this summer night, you in front of me
Makes me contemplate the origins of good and evil

Because you take and you take and you take and you take
But you taste like the beach and a kiss
Candy from my eyes
In my veins you run citrus

Watercolor images of serpents on orange trees
Arise in my midst
Kundalini, you breathe me
I could do this forever

But my heart is very fragile
And I have nothing left to give

"Bare Feet On Linoleum"

Stay on your path Sylvia Plath
Don't fall away like all the others

Don't take all your secrets alone to your watery grave about
Lovers and -

The secrets you keep will keep you in deep like Amy and -
And brother
And all of the people you meet on the street will reiterate lies
That they uttered

Leave me in peace, I cry
In the middle of the night
On a slow boat bound for Catalina for no reason

Tiny drops of perspiration dot my forehead
Could be mistaken for dew drops if this were photo season

But alas this is a real life  and it's been a real fight just to
Stop my mind from committing treason
Why you ask
Because she told the townspeople I was crazy, and the lies, they
Started to believe them

But anyways  that's all over now

I've moved on, gone scorched earth
And now I'm left wondering where to go from here
To Sonoma where the fires have just left
South Dakota

Would standing in front of Mount Rushmore feel like the Great
American homecoming I never had

Would the magnitude of the scale of the sculptures take the place
Of the warm embrace I've never got

Or should I just be here now
Bare feet on linoleum
Slicing vegetables onto water that I will later turn
Into stew

People love my stories
People love visions

"White Dress"

Sun stare, don't care with my head in my hands
Thinking of a simpler time
Like Sun Ra, feel small
But I had it under control every time

When I was a waitress wearing a white dress
Look how I do this, look how I got this
I was a waitress working the night shift
You were my man, felt like I got this
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
Down in Orlando, I was only nineteen
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
I only mention it 'cause it was such a scene
And I felt seen
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

Summer, sizzling
Listening to jazz out on the lawn
Listening to White Stripes when they were white-hot
Listening to rock all day long

When I was a waitress wearing a tight dress handling the heat
I wasn't famous, just listening to Kings of Leon to the beat
Like look at how I got this, look how I got this
Just singing the street
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
I felt free 'cause I was only nineteen
Such a scene

Summer, summer's almost gone
We were talking about life, we were sitting outside 'til dawn
But I would still go back
If I could do it all again, I thought
Because it made me feel, made me feel like a god
'Cause it made me feel, made me feel like a god
Somehow it made me feel, made me feel like a god

When I was a waitress wearing a white dress
Look how I do this, look how I got this
When I was a waitress working the night shift
You were my man, felt like I got this
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
Down in Orlando, I was only nineteen
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
I only mention it 'cause it was such a scene
And I felt seen
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

When I was a waitress wearing a tight dress
Like, look how I do it, look how I got this
I was a waitress wearing a tight dress
Like, look how I do this, look how I got this

It made me feel, made me feel like a god
It kinda makes me feel, like maybe I was better off
'Cause it made me feel, made me feel like a god
It kinda makes me feel, like maybe I was better off

"Chemtrails Over The Country Club"

I'm on the run with you, my sweet love
There's nothing wrong contemplating God
Under the chemtrails over the country club
We're in our jewels in the swimming pool
Me and my sister just playing it cool
Under the chemtrails over the country club

Take out your turquoise and all of your jewels
Go to the market, the kids' swimming pools
Baby, what's your sign
My moon's in Leo, my Cancer is sun
You won't play, you're no fun
Well, I don't care what they think
Drag racing my little red sports car
I'm not unhinged or unhappy, I'm just wild

I'm on the run with you, my sweet love
There's nothing wrong contemplating God
Under the chemtrails over the country club
We're in our jewels in the swimming pool
Me and my sister just playing it cool
Under the chemtrails over the country club

Meet you for coffee at the elementary schools
We laugh about nothing as the summer gets cool
It's beautiful how this deep normality settles down over me
I'm not bored or unhappy, I'm still so strange and wild

I'm in the wind, I'm in the water
Nobody's son, nobody's daughter
Watching the chemtrails over the country club
Suburbia, The Brentwood Market
What to do next Baby, what of it
White picket chemtrails over the country club

My love, my love

Washing my hair, doing the laundry
Late night TV, I want you only
Like when we were kids under chemtrails and country clubs
It's never too late, baby, so don't give up
It's never too late, baby, so don't give up
Under the chemtrails over the country club, yeah (You're born in December and I'm born in June)
Under the chemtrails, over the country club, yeah (You're born in December and I'm born in June)

My Cancer is sun and my Leo is moon
My Cancer is sun and my Leo is moon

"Tulsa Jesus Freak"

You should stay real close to Jesus
Keep that bottle at your hand, my man
Find your way back to my bed again
Sing me like a Bible hymn
We should go back to Arkansas
Trade this body for the can of gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind

You should come back to our place, baby
Don't be afraid of our love
On the second floor, darling
In a second flat, hurry up
'Cause down in Arkansas the stores are all closed
The kids in their hoodies, they dance super slow
We're white-hot forever and only God knows

You should stay real close to Jesus
Keep that bottle at your hand, my man
Find your way back to my bed again
Sing me like a Bible hymn
We should go back to Arkansas
Trade this body for the can of gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind

We'll be white-hot forever
White-hot forever
White-hot forever
And ever and ever, amen

Could I come back to the ranch, baby
I had to get away for a while
Just to rest my nerves, darling
Can I make you laugh with a smile
You knew when you chose me
I was nothing but ordinary
And now the wind's blowing, reminding you of what you know

You should stay real close to Jesus
Keep that bottle at your hand, my man
Find your way back to my bed again
Sing me like a Bible hymn
We should go back to Arkansas
Trade this body for that can of gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind

We'll be white-hot forever
White-hot forever
White-hot forever
And ever and ever, the end
White-hot forever
White-hot forever
White-hot forever
And ever and ever, amen

You should stay real close to Jesus
If you don't pray, you'll never learn
Keep that bottle at your hand, my man
You know what I'm saying
Find your way back to my bed again
Sing me like a Bible hymn
We should go back to Arkansas
I like living here
Trade this body for the can of gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind

"Let Me Love You Like A Woman"

I come from a small town, how 'bout you
I only mention it 'cause I'm ready to leave LA
And I want you to come
Eighty miles north or south will do
I don't care where as long as you're with me
And I'm with you and you let me

Let me love you like a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be who I'm meant to be
Talk to me in poems and songs
Don't make me be bittersweet
Let me love you like a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me hold you like a baby

I come from a small town far away
I only mention it 'cause I'm ready to leave LA
And I want you to come (And I need you to come)
I guess I could manage if you stay
It's just if you do, I can't see myself having any fun, so

Let me love you like a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be who I'm meant to be
Talk to me in songs and poems
Don't make me be bittersweet
Let me love you like a woman

Take you to infinity
Let me love you like a woman (Let me hold you like a baby)
Take you to infinity
Let me love you like a woman (Let me hold you like a baby)
Take you to infinity

We could get lost in the purple rain
Talk about the good ol' days
We could get high on some pink champagne
Baby, let me count the ways

Let me love you like a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be who I'm meant to be
Talk to me in songs and poems
Don't make me be bittersweet
Let me love you like a woman

"Wild At Heart"

What would you do if I told you
You made me crazy
To see your pretty pics on Sunset Boulevard
And it makes me lazy
So I smoke cigarettes
Just to understand the smog

I love you lots like polka dots
You're killing me more
Than coffee pots and Insta' thots
With every drop I pour
And if I had to do it all again
I would because, babe, in the end
It brought me here to you

I left Calabasas, escaped all the ashes, ran into the dark
And it made me wild, wild, wild at heart
The cameras have flashes, they cause the car crashes
But I'm not a star
If you love me, you'll love me
'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart
If they love me, they'll love me
'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart

What would you do if I wouldn't sing for them no more
Like if you heard I was out in the bars drinking Jack and Coke
Going crazy for anyone who would listen to my stories, babe
Time after time, I think about leaving
But you know that I never do just 'cause you keep me believing

I love you lots, despite the odds
You're killing me, John
And all these thoughts brought us apart
And that's okay, too
'Cause even in the worst of times
You saw the best of me
And that's why I stay here with you

I left Calabasas, escaped all the ashes, ran into the dark
And it made me wild, wild, wild at heart
The cameras have flashes, they cause the car crashes
But I'm not a star
If you love me, you'll love me
'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart
If you love me, you'll love me
'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart

'Cause, baby, I'm wild at heart
If you love me, you'll love me
'Cause I'm wild at heart
Baby, I'm wild, wild at heart
If they love me, they'll love me
'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart
If they love me, they'll love me
'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart

"Dark But Just A Game"

"It's dark, but just a game"
That's what he would say to me
The faces aren't the same, but their stories all end tragically
(Sweet or whatever, baby)
And that's the price of fame
A tale as old as time you'd be (Sweet or whatever, baby)
A pretty little fool to think exceptions to the rule
Just walk around like you and me, this way
But life is sweet or whatever, baby
You gotta take them for what they got
And while the whole world is crazy
We're getting high in the parking lot

We keep changing all the time
The best ones lost their minds
So I'm not gonna change
I'll stay the same
No rose left on the vines
Don't even want what's mine
Much less the fame
It's dark, but just a game
It's dark, but just a game

It's dark, but just a game
So play it like a symphony
You know our love's the same, they'll both go down in infamy
I was a pretty little thing and God, I loved to sing
But nothing came from either one but pain (But fuck it)
Life is sweet or whatever, baby
Don't ever think it's not
While the whole world is crazy
We're making out in the parking lot

We keep changing all the time
The best ones lost their minds
So I'm not gonna change
I'll stay the same
No rose left on the vines
Don't even want what's mine
Much less the fame
It's dark, but just a game
We keep changing all the time
The best ones lost their minds
So I'm not gonna change
I'll stay the same
No rose left on the vines
Don't even want what's mine
Much less the fame
It's dark, but just a game
It's dark, but just a game
It's dark, but just

"Not All Who Wander Are Lost"

I've been wearing the same damn clothes for three damn days
Lincoln, Nebraska's got me in a haze
The thing about men like you is you got a lot to say
But will you stay

You say you got my name on your tattoo
Opening up doors, pulling out chairs, look at you
You talk to God like I do, I think you know
The same secrets that I do, I'm talking 'bout

Not all those who wander are lost
Not all those who wander are lost
Not all those who wander, all those who wander
All those who wander are lost
It's just wanderlust

The thing about being on the road
Is there's too much time to think
About seasons of old
As you pour yourself a drink
'Cause every time I said no
It wasn't quite what I meant
If you know what I mean

You said you got my name as your tattoo
Pulling out chairs, opening doors, look at you
You talk to people like I do, I think you know
The same things that I do

Not all those who wander are lost
Not all those who wander are lost
Not all those who wander, all those who wander
All those who wander are lost
It's just wanderlust

Look at me, look at you
Look at what you made me do
Look at me, look at you
Bible on your tattoo
Look at me, look at you
Look at what you made me do
Look at me, look at you

Not all those who wander are lost
Not all those who wander are lost
Not all those who wander, all those who wander
All those who wander are lost
It's just wanderlust

"Yosemite"

Seasons may change
But we won't change
Isn't it sweet how we know that already
Winter to spring
Spring back to fall
Isn't it cool how nothing here changes at all

You make me feel I'm invincible
Just like I wanted
No more candle in the wind
It's not like I'm invisible
Not like before when I was burning at both ends

We did it for fun, we did it for free
I did it for you, you did it for me
We did it for the right reasons
We did it for the right reasons

Seasons may change
But we won't change
Isn't it strange how different we are from all of our friends
Seasons will turn
The world, it will turn
The only thing we'll turn is the pages of all of the poems we burned

Honey, you made me feel I'm invincible
It's just like I wanted
No more candle in the wind
It's not like I'm invisible
Like I was before, no more burning at both ends

Now I do it for fun, I do it for free
I do it for you, you did it for me
We did it for the right reasons
We did it for the right reasons

I remember watching How Green Was My Valley
Then I was thinking
"How deep was the canyon that you came from"
Television static was quite overwhelming
Was it because of the cabin and the candles in the wind

We've done it for fun, we've done it for free
I showed up for you, you showed up for me
We did it for the right reasons
We did it for fun, we did it for free

When I was young 'til eternity
I'll do it for the right reasons
Withstanding all the time, changes, and seasons
Right reasons

"Breaking Up Slowly"

Breaking up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, but it's making me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely, but it's the right thing

Are these my good years or do I have none
Are there really good years for everyone
I don't wanna live with a life of regret
I don't wanna end up like Tammy Wynette

'Cause breaking up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, but it's making me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely, but it's the right thing to do

George got arrested out on the lawn
We might be breaking up after this song
Will he still love me long after I'm gone
Or did he see it coming all along

'Cause breaking up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, and it's making me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely, baby, breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up slowly, baby, breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, and it's making me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely, but it's the right thing to do

"Dance Till We Die"

I'm covering Joni and I'm dancing with Joan
Stevie is calling on the telephone
Court almost burned down my home
But God, it feels good not to be alone

But sometimes, this ranch feels like my only friend
And life doesn't always work out like we planned
We keep it moving, babe

So we made it back in the middle of the night
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancing 'til we die
We'll keep walking on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancing 'til we die

Troubled by my circumstance
Burdened by the weight of fame
Clementine's not just a fruit
It's my daughter's chosen name

And when all the bars close down tonight
There's one that stays open just for us, alright
We keep dancing, babe

So we made it back in the middle of the night (We keep dancing, babe)
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright (We keep it moving, babe)
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancing 'til we die
We'll keep walking on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancing 'til we die

I went down to Woodside
I left Berkeley, out of city, out of mind
Killing it, talking shit, Joan said she was gonna quit
Tearing it up at the Afro-Caribbean two-step
I left San Francisco
I've been covering Joni and I'm dancing with Joan
It's kinda hard to find love
When you're used to rolling like a rolling stone

So we made it back in the middle of the night (We keep it moving, babe)
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright (We keep dancing, babe)
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancing 'til we die
We'll keep walking on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancing 'til we die
And we won't stop dancing 'til we die

"For Free"
(feat. ella Day & Weyes Blood)

I slept last night in a good hotel
I went shopping today for jewels
The wind rushed around in the dirty town
And the children let out from their school
I was standing on a noisy corner
Waiting for the walking green
Across the street, he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet for free

Now me, I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I've got a black Limousine and two gentlemen
Who escort me through these halls
And I'll play if you've got the money
Or if you're a friend to me
But the one-man band by the quick lunch stand
He's been playing real good for free

Nobody stopped to hear him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never been on the TV
So they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain as the signal changed
He was playing real good for free

"Text Book"

I guess you could call it textbook
I was lookin' for the father I wanted back
And I thought I found it in Brentwood
It seemed only appropriate you'd easily have my back

And then there was the issue of her
I didn't even like myself, or love the life I had
And there you were with shining stars
Standin' blue with open arms
You touched the detriment most of the friends I knew already had

You've got a Thunderbird, my daddy had one, too
Let's rewrite history, I'll do this dance with you
You know I'm not that girl, you know I'll never be
Maybe just the way we're different could set me free
And there we were, screamin' "Black Lives Matter" in the crowd
By the Old Man River, and I saw you saw who I am
God, I wish I was with my father
He could see us in all our splendor
All the things I couldn't want for him
I screamed for them, oh-oh-oh
I screamed for them, ah-ah

Could we do this dance again
Do you think if I go blonde, we could get our old love back
I guess this is really the end
I never felt jealous before this year, but I'm jealous now

People say we're too much alike
But maybe, finally, that'll make it right
In the end of all these sleepless nights
Other men I met felt right
Would smile at you and stick a knife
In your back
Finally, I met you so I'm not wonderin' why

You've got a Thunderbird, my daddy had one, too
Let's rewrite history, I'll do this dance with you
You know I'm not that girl, you know I'll never be
Maybe just the way we're different could set me free
There we were, screamin' "Black Lives Matter" in the crowd
By the Old Man River, and I saw you saw who I am
God, I wish I was with my father
He could see us in all our splendor
All the things I couldn't want for him
I screamed for them, oh-oh-oh
I screamed for them, ah-ah

Old Man River keeps rollin'
With or without him
Old Man River keeps rollin'
Without him, oh, my old man
Old Man River keeps rollin', oh

"Blue Banisters"

There's a picture on the wall
Of me on a John Deere
Jenny handed me a beer
Said, "How the hell did you get there"
Oh, Oklahoma
Mm-mm, mm

There were flowers that were dry
Sittin' on the dresser
She asked me where they're from
I said, "A place I don't remember"
Oh, Oklahoma (Oh-oh)

Jenny jumped into the pool
She was swimmin' with Nikki Lane
She said, "Most men don't want a woman
With a legacy, it's of age"
She said "You can't be a muse and be happy, too
You can't blacken the pages with Russian poetry
And be happy"
And that scared me
'Cause I met a man who

Said he'd come back every May
Just to help me if I'd paint my banisters blue
Blue banisters, ooh
Said he'd fix my weathervane
Give me children, take away my pain
And paint my banisters blue
My banisters blue

There's a hole that's in my heart
All my women try and heal
They're doin' a good job
Convincin' me that it's not real
It's heat lightning, oh-oh-oh, oh

'Cause there's a man that's in my past
There's a man that's still right here
He's real enough to touch
In my darkest nights, he's shinin'
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Jenny was smokin' by the pool
We were writin' with Nikki Lane
I said I'm scared of the Santa Clarita Fires
I wish that it would rain
I said the power of us three can bring absolutely anything
Except that one thing
The diamonds, the rust, and the rain
The thing that washes away the pain
But that's okay, 'cause

Now when weather turns to May
All my sisters come to paint my banisters green
My blue banisters grey
Tex and Mex are in the Bay
Chucky's makin' birthday cake
Chickens runnin', bare feet, there's a baby on the way
And now my blue banisters are green and grey, ah-ah

Summer comes, winter goes
Spring, I skip, God knows
Summer comes, winter goes
Spring, I sleep, Heaven knows
Every time it turns to May
All my sisters fly to me
To paint, paint

"Arcadia"

My body is a map of LA
I stand straight like an angel, with a halo
Hangin' out the Hilton Hotel window
Screamin', "Heyo, baby, let's go"
My chest, the Sierra Madre
My hips, every high and byway
That you trace with your fingertips like a Toyota
Run your hands over me like a Land Rover

In Arcadia, Arcadia
All roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
That pump the blood that flows straight to the heart of me
America, America
I can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel
Or a cross on the hill, I'm a lost little girl
Findin' my way to ya
Arcadia

My body is a map of L.A
And my heart is like paper, I hate ya
I'm not from the land of the palms, so I know I can't stay here
I'm not native, but
My curves, San Gabriel all day
And my lips like the fire licks the bay
If you think that you know yourself, you can come over
Lay your hands on me like you're a Land Rover

In Arcadia, Arcadia
All roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
That get the blood flowing straight to the heart of me
America, I need a miracle
I can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel
Or a cross on the hill, I'm a lost little girl
Findin' my way to ya
Arcadia

They built me up three hundred feet tall just to tear me down
So I'm leavin' with nothing but laughter, and this town
Arcadia
Findin' my way to ya
I'm leavin' them as I was, five foot eight
Western bound, plus the hate that they gave
By the way, thanks for that, on the way, I'll pray for ya
But you'll need a miracle
America

"Black Bathing Suit"

Grenadine quarantine, I like you a lot
It's LA, "Hey" on oom, Target parking lot
And if this is the end, I want a boyfriend
Someone to eat ice cream with and watch television
Or walk home from the mall with
'Cause what I really meant is when I'm being honest
I'm tired of this shit

'Cause my body is my temple, my heart is one too
The only thing that still fits me is this black bathing suit
You don't know me any better than they do, baby
My time is run over, so the only time you'll ever see me
Is in your dreams, in my black bathing suit
Lookin' at me lookin' over at you real cute 'cause

He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better
He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better

Swisher Sweet, magazines, promise you it's not
'Cause of you that I'm mean, it's my afterthoughts
And what I never said, why there's a price on my head
It's nothin' to do with them, it's my karmic lineage
So I'm not friends with my mother, but I still love my dad
Untraditional lover, can you handle that

I guess I'm complicated, my life's sorta too
I wish you could see to my soul through this black bathing suit
You don't know me any better than they do, baby
'Cause I sing like an angel, my heart's like one too
The only thing that fits is this black bathing suit
Lookin' at me lookin' over at you real cute 'cause

He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better
He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better
They said I was bad, and I'll show them what bad girls do

My black bathing suit
(Oh, let 'em talk about me)
They're just yesterday's news
(They're fucking broke and we're laughin' about them)
Mail me when you get the blues
(We'll have the last laugh about it)
By the way, thanks for the shoes (Haha)
Your interest really made stacks
Your interest really made stacks
Your interest really made stacks out of it
Your interest really made stacks out of it for me
So thanks for that
Your interest really made stacks out of it for me
So thanks for that
Your interest really made stacks out of it for me
So thanks for that

"If You Lie Down With Me"

Put your red boots on, baby, giddy up
Baby wants a dance, baby gets her way
Dreamy nights, talk to me with that whiskey breath
Twirl me twice, I'll treat you like a holiday

And don't say you're over me
When we both know that you ain't
Don't say you're over me
Babe, it's already too late
Just do what you do best with me

Dance me all around the room
Spin me like a ballerina, super high
Dance me all around the moon
Light me up like the Fourth of July
Once, twice, three times the guy I
Ever thought I would meet, so
Don't say you're over me
When we both know that you lie

If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
When you lie down, lie next to me

Get your jacket on, be a gentleman
Get into your truck and pick me up at eight
'Cause we were built for the long haul freight train
Burnt by fire without trial like a stowaway

And don't say you're over me
When they all know that you ain't
If you lay down, lie next to me

Dance me all around the room
Spin me like a ballerina, super high
Dance me all around the moon
Like six times 'till I'm sick and I cry
Once, twice, three times the guy I
Ever thought I would meet, so
Don't say you're over me
When they all know that you're lying

If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
You lie, you lie
If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
You lie, you lie
When you lie down, lie next to me

"Beautiful"

Lets keep it simple, babe
Don't make me complicated
Don't tell me to be glad when I'm sad
I really hate that
I try not to be bad
He's interested, he's holding me back
If I could be more like you, I would
But I can't, and I'm glad about that

What if someone had asked Picasso not to be sad
Never known who he was or the man he'd become
There would be no blue period
Let me run with the wolves, let me do what I do
Let me show you how sadness can turn into happiness
I can turn blue into something

Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you

Let's keep it simple, babe
We can't afford to change it
Don't turn me into somethin' I'm not
There's no way to sustain it
I try not to hold back
It seems either way it makes you mad
So I'll be who I'll be if you think that that's cool
Then I'll take you back

What if someone had asked Picasso not to be sad
Never known who he was or the man he'd become
There would be no blue period
Let me run with the wolves, let me do what I do
Let me show you how sadness can turn into happiness
I can turn blue into something

Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you

Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you

"Violets For Roses"

There's something in the air
The girls are runnin' 'round in summer dresses
With their masks off and it makes me so happy
Larchmont Village smells like lilies of the valley
And the bookstore doors are opening
And it's finally happening

Ever since I fell out of love with you I fell back in love with me
And, boy, does it feel sweet
Like a summer breeze
Ever since I fell out of love with you I fell back in love with the city
Like the Paramount sign sparkling
Sparkling just for me

You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to trade in my new truck for Rollses
Don't forget all of these things that you love are the same things I hate
A simple life, I chose this
You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to take all the pink off my toes, and
God knows the only mistake that a man can make
Is tryna make a woman change and trade her violets for roses

Ah-la-ha, ah-ha
Trade her violets for roses
Ah-la-ha, ah-ha

There's something in the air
I hope it doesn't change, that it's for real
The beginning of something big happening
And by the murder alleys
In the streets have ceased
And still the shadows haunt the avenue
The silence is deafening

Ever since I fell out of love with you I fell back in love with the streets
And, God, does it feel sweet
Like a summer breeze
Ever since I fell out of love with you I breakdance to the backbeat
And, God, does it sound sweet
Like it's playing just for me

You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to trade in my new truck for Rollses
Don't forget all of these things that you love are the same things I hate
A simple life, I chose this
You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to take all the pink off my toes, and
God knows the only mistake that a man can make
Is tryin' to make a woman change and trade her violets for roses

Ah-la-ha, ah-ha
Trade her violets for roses
Ah-la-ha, ah-ha
Trade her violets for roses
(Ah-la-ha, ah-ha)

There's something in the air
The girls are runnin' 'round in summer dresses
With their masks off and it makes me so happy

"Dealer"
(feat. Miles Kane)

Please don't try to find me through my dealer
He won't pick up his phone
Please don't try my father either
He ain't been home for years
I know I'm no spirit seeker
I can't sleep through the tears
I get lost in the ether

I check it, I wreck it, I turn it around
I gave you all my money, gave you all my money
Gave you all my money, gave you all my money
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna give you nothing
'Cause you never give me nothing back
Why can't you be good for something
Not one shirt off your back
Why can't you be good for something
Not one shirt off your back

Please don't try to find me through my dealer
He won't pick up his phone
Please don't try my doctor either
He won't take any calls
He's no fucking spirit healer
He just can't stop to talk
But he's gone now for the weekend

I check it, I wreck it, and I'll explain
I gave you all my money, gave you all my money
Gave you all my money, gave you all my money
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna give you nothing
'Cause you never give me nothing back
Why can't you be good for something
Not one shirt off your back
Why can't you be good for something
Not one shirt off your back

555
Please don't try to find me through my dealer
9275, 555
Now you've got a busy tone
He won't pick up his phone
All circuits are busy, goodbye
All circuits are busy, you're high
Please don't try my father either
All circuits are busy, goodbye
All circuits are busy, you're high
He ain't been home for years

"Thunder"

You roll like thunder
When you come crashin' in
Town ain't been the same
Since you left with all your friends
You roll like thunder
When you come crashing in
Regattas in the wind
That's why you're visiting

You act like fucking Mr. Brightside when you're with all your friends
But I know what you're like
When the party ends

Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait

You roll like thunder
Pourin' all your drinks
The party's lit and you, my friend, half-cut when it begins
You roll like thunder
You're tryna catch that wind
That lightning in the bottle
That moonbeam in your hand

And you try to see the bright side when each new day begins
But you're not satisfied
At the rainbow's end

Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
I don't wanna wait
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait

'Cause if you're on fire, you're on fire (Just do it)
Just keep burnin', 'til rain (Just do it, don't wait)
Baby, keep me ablaze
Honey, if you're on fire, you're on fire (Just do it)
Just keep burning, keep me alive (Just do it, don't wait)
Spare your blade

Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
If hello just means goodbye then honey, better walk away
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
If hello just means goodbye then baby, better walk away
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
'Cause I don't wanna wait
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait

(Just do it)
(Just do it, don't wait)
If you're on fire, you're on fire
You should just keep burning
(Just do it)
(Just do it, don't wait)
(Just do it)
(Just do it, don't wait)

"Wildflower Wildfire"

Here's the deal
'Cause I know you wanna talk about it
Here's the deal
I promise you, like, a million tomorrows
Here's the deal
What I can promise is I'll lie down
Like a bed of wildflowers
And I'll always make the sheets
Smell like gardenias wild at your feet
And I nourish you hazily

Baby, I, I, I, I've been runnin' on stardust
Alone for so long
I wouldn't know what hot fire was
Hot fire, hot weather, hot coffee
I'm better with you
It's strange, but it's true, darling

Not to turn into a wildfire
To light up your night
With only my smile and nothing that burns
Baby, I'll be like a wildflower
I live on sheer willpower
I'll do my best never to turn into something
That burns, burns, burns
Like the others, baby, burns, burns, burns

Here's the deal
'Cause I know you wanna talk about it
Here's the deal
You say there's gaps to fill in, so here
Here's the deal
My father never stepped in when his wife would rage at me
So I ended up awkward but sweet
Later then hospitals, and still on my feet
Comfortably numb, but with lithium came poetry

And baby, I, I've been running on star drip
IV's for so long
I wouldn't know how cruel the world was
Hot fire, hot weather, hot coffee, I'm better
So I turn, but I learn (It from you, babe)

Not to turn into a wildfire
To light up your night
With only my smile and nothing that hurts
Baby, I run like a wildflower
I live on sheer willpower
I promise that nothing will burn you
Nothing will burn, burn, burn
Like the others, baby, burns, burns, burns
Burn, burn, burn (Like the others, baby)
Like the others, baby, burns, burns, burns

It's you from whom I learn, learn, learn
It's you from whom I learn, learn, learn

"Nectar Of The Gods"

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

What cruel world is this Nectar of the Gods
Heroin gold in my veins, and you in my thoughts
I'm on the freeway racing at a million and I just can't stop
I call you up twice, hang up the phone, call again, I wanna talk

I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like you never knew, knew, knew
I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like the color blue, ooh-ooh

What sweet world is this Honey on the vine
School kid dreams came true then passed in the night
I used to dream about people like you, now I don't know why
I used to sing about people like you, now I just get high

I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like you never knew, knew, knew
I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like the color blue, ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like you never knew, ooh, ooh
I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like the color blue, ooh-ooh

Californ-I-A, homeland of the Gods
Once I found my way but now I am lost

"Living Legend"

Blackbirds will sing in the same key
As you play in the shoes that I bought you
And sweet baby Jane don't know a thing
About my songs but she knows I'm a monsoon

And baby you, all the things you do
And the ways you move, send me straight to heaven
And baby you, what you never knew
What I never said, is you're my living legend

Hipsters will sing just like a dream
In Sin- or the back Brooklyn bayou
But you never cared about my name
And darling I never meant to defy you

But baby you, all them things you do
And those ways you moved, send me straight to heaven
And baby you, I never said to you
You really are my living legend

I got guns in the summertime and horses too
Guns in the summertime and horses too
I never meant to be bad or unwell
I was just living on the edge
Right between Heaven and Hell
And I'm tired of it

Oh, all the things you do
And the ways you move, send me straight to heaven
And baby you, what I never said to you
'Cause you really are my living legend

Why, why, why
Why, why, why
Why, why, why
Why, why, why

My living legend
My living legend
My living legend
My living legend

"Cherry Blossom"

What you don't tell no one, you can tell me
Little ghost, tall, tan like milk and honey
You're very brave
And very free

I push you high, cherry blossom on your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me

Swing it high like Jesus, wild and free
Dandelions in your hair, baby
You're very brave
And there's much to see

I push you high, cherry blossom on your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me

And when you're scared
I'll be right here
You feel afraid
Mommy is there
It's a cruel, cruel world
But we don't care
'Cause what we've got
We've got to share

What you don't tell no one, you can tell me
Little ghost, blonde hair with lemonade tea
There's much to learn
And so much to see

I push you high, Angelina, on your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me

"Sweet Carolina"

(Okay)
Don't have to write me a letter
'Cause I'll always be right here
Closer to you than your next breath, my dear

We love every hair on your head
Love you like God loves you
And you say that you're scared
Might be unprepared for havin' the baby blues

Baby blues, baby blues
If things ever go wrong
Just know this is your song and we love you

You name your babe Lilac Heaven
After your iPhone 11
"Crypto forever" screams your stupid boyfriend
Fuck you, Kevin

We love every freckle you have
We love you like God loves you
If you're ever stressed out, just dance in the night
If you get those baby blues

Baby blues, baby blues
If things ever go wrong
Just know this is your song and we love you

Pink slippers all on the floor and woven nets over the door
It's as close as we'll get to the dream that they had
In the one night sixties, and
Jason is out in the lawn
And he powerwashes every time things go wrong
If you're stressed out, just know you can dance to your song
'Cause we got you

If you get the blues, baby blues
Just know this is your song
It'll live on and on, way past me and you
If you get the blues, baby blues
You've got us, we've got you
So there's nothing to lose, and we love you

So don't write me a letter
I'll always be right here
Closer to you than your next breath, my dear

"The Grants"

One, two, ready
I'm gonna take mine with you with me
Ah, "Mine," say it again
"Mine of you with me," thank you
One more time
One, two, ready
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
Like "Rocky Mountain High"
The way John Denver sings

So you say there's a chance for us
Should I do a dance for once
You're a family man, but
But

Do you think about Heaven Oh-oh
Do you think about me
My pastor told me
"When you leave, all you take
Uh-huh, is your memories"

And I'm gonna take mine of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with me

So many mountains too high to climb
So many rivers, so long, but I'm
Doin' the hard stuff, I'm doin' my time
I'm doin' it for us, for our family line

Do you think about Heaven Oh-oh
Do you think about me
My pastor told me (I'll do it, I'll do it)
"When you leave, all you take (I did it, I did it)
Uh-huh, is your memories"

And I wanna take mine of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
Yeah, I'm gonna take mine of you with me
Like "Rocky Mountain High," the way John Denver sings

My sister's first-born child
I'm gonna take that too with me
My grandmother's last smile
I'm gonna take that too with me
It's a beautiful life
Remember that too for me

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah

"Did You Know That There's A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd"

Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd
Mosaic ceilings, painted tiles on the wall
I can't help but feel someone like my body marred my soul
Handmade beauty, sealed up by two man-made walls
And I'm like

When's it gonna be my turn
When's it gonna be my turn
Open me up, tell me you like it
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd
There's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd

There's a girl that sings Hotel California
Not because she loves the notes or sounds, the sound that floated out
It's because she's in a world preserved, only a few have found the door
It's like Camarillo, only silver mirrors running down the corridor
Oh, man

When's it gonna be my turn
Don't forget me
When's it gonna be my turn
Open me up, tell me you like me
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd
Don't forget me
There's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd

Harry Nilsson has a song, his voice breaks at 205
Something about the way he says, "Don't forget me"
Makes me feel like
I just wish I had a friend like him, someone to give me fire
Leaning in my back, whispering in my ear
"Come on, baby, you can drive"
But I can't

When's it gonna be my turn
Don't forget me
When's it gonna be my turn
Open me up, tell me you like it
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd

Don't forget me
At the tunnel under Ocean Blvd
Don't forget me
At the tunnel under Ocean Blvd
Don't forget me
At the tunnel under Ocean Blvd

Don't forget me, don't forget me
No, no, no, don't forget me
Don't you, don't you forget me (No, oh)

"Sweet"

Stars in my eyes, hiking up Griffith
Thinking about who was sad and what didn't
Get said in the Midwest, wish I could tell you now
I wrote you a note, but I didn't send it
'Cause that's the best method the women here taught me about
What you don't really understand
I've got magic in my hand, stars in my eyes

I'm a different kind of woman
If you want some basic bitch go to the Beverly Center and find her
I'm sweet
Bare feet
If you wanna go where nobody goes
That's where you'll find me
In the sweet north country
If I'm not there, come to my house on Genesee

What you doing with your life Do you think about it
Do you contemplate where we came from
Lately, we've been making out a lot
Not talking 'bout the stuff that's at the very heart of things
Do you want children Do you wanna marry me
Do you wanna run marathons in Long Beach by the sea
I've got things to do like nothing at all
I wanna do them with you, do you wanna do them with me

If you want someone, then just call me up
And remember where I'll be
Sweet and bare feet
You can find me where no one will be
In the woods somewhere, in the night
In the heart of a valley
In the sweet north country
If I'm not there, come to my house on Genesee

"A&W"

I haven't done a cartwheel since I was nine
I haven't seen my mother in a long, long time
I mean, look at me
Look at the length of my hair, and my face, the shape of my body
Do you really think I give a damn
What I do after years of just hearing them talking

I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter

Call him up, "Come into my bedroom"
Ended up, we fuck on the hotel floor
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore
This is the experience of bein' an American whore

Called up one drunk, called up another
Forensic Files wasn't on
Watching Teenage Diary of a Girl
Wondering what went wrong
I'm a princess, I'm divisive
Ask me why, why, why I'm like this
Maybe I'm just kinda like this
I don't know, maybe I'm just like this

I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter

Call him up, he comes over again
Yeah, I know I'm over my head but, oh
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore

I mean look at my hair
Look at the length of it and the shape of my body
If I told you that I was raped
Do you really think that anybody would think
I didn't ask for it I didn't ask for it
I won't testify, I already fucked up my story
On top of this (Mm), so many other things you can't believe
Did you know a singer can still be
Looking like a sidepiece at thirty-three
God's a charlatan, don't look back, babe
Puts the shower on while he calls me
Slips out the back door to talk to me
I'm invisible, look how you hold me
I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I'm a ghost now, look how you hold me now

It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore (Oh, okay)
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore

This is the experience of bein' an American whore
This is the experience of bein' an American whore
This is the experience of bein' an American whore
Woo

Jimmy, Jimmy, cocoa puff, Jimmy, Jimmy, ride

Jimmy, if you leave the house, find me in the club (Like)
Jimmy, if you switch it up, you should light it up
Jimmy, if you leave the house, find me in the club (Like, surf's up)
Your mom called, I told her, you're fuckin' up big time
But I don't care, baby, I already lost my mind
Jimmy, if I lie it up, find me in the club (Mind, mind)
Your mom called, I told her, you're fucking up big time

Jimmy, Jimmy, cocoa puff, Jimmy, Jimmy, ride

Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high

Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Your mom called, I told her, you're fuckin' up big time

"Judah Smith Interlude"

I don't understand what that means
It means quit lusting after your neighbor
That's a heck of a life
You get to love your children in front of you
You get to love, you have to talk to somebody "I want a new life"
"I don't love my wife anymore, I don't love my kids anymore
Missing out on life at usually my age"
Does that sound like love
It's a life dominated with lust
And for too long, they've been holding it up
And finally, they just get weak and they say
"It doesn't matter anymore"
And the Spirit of God says, "I'll infuse you with desires for what you have and what's in front of you."
(Yeah, yeah)

So, as it works deep in your heart
As you call out to Him and say, "How could you do it to me, Man"
Help me want what I got. Help me love what's in front of me
Help me want more of my wife and more of my friends
And help me serve the city I live in
And not wish it away and hope I can move
Help me, God
I wanna be a man in love, not a man in lust."
But you've gotta do that
So I bring you to this verse, then I'm done, I'm done
Psalms, chapter 8

And do you know where I got this verse
This is gonna sound crazy to you, but I'm gonna tell you the absolute truth
It's gonna make me sound so superior to us all
I'm looking forward to it
I woke up this morning and God said, "Check the Bible"
I don't know if it was God, but if felt like God in my head
I thought if I hadn't checked the Bible
I'm gonna speak to you from the verse of the day
That means I don't have to do anything, I don't have to look anywhere
Just get to the verse of the day
So I get to the verse of the day and here's the verse of the day
Today, in the Bible

Look at this (It's cool)
Look at the splendor of the skies
You creative genius glowing in the heavens
When I gaze, when I gaze at Your moon and Your stars
Mounted like jewels in their setting
I know, You are the fascinating artist who fashioned it all
When I look up and I see such wonder and workmanship above
I have to ask this question
I've gotta ask this question
Compared to all this cosmic glory
Why would you ever bother with puny, mortal men
Or beooh, don't get me started, I could preach another hourbe infatuated
Totally infatuated with Adam's son

Why are you so infatuated with me
You're the star creator, You're the ocean maker (Yeah, yeah)
You're the whale creator, you're the rhino designer
Who, who are you (Rhino designer)
And then, and then it goes on in verse 5
And it says, "Yet what honor you have given to men
Created only a little lower than Elohim
Which is the name of Creator God
Artist God"
You wanna call God "artist"
At some point tonight when you go to bed pray
"Yo, Elohim," and he'll hear, "You're the best artist ever"

Crowned like kings and queens with glory and magnificence
You have delighted, You delegated to them mastery over all You have made
You've made me a partner with You
I used to think my preaching was mostly about you
And you're not gonna like this but I'm gonna to tell You the truth
I've discovered my preaching is mostly about me

"Candy Necklace"
(feat. Jon Batiste)

White flowers, cinnamon on my teeth
And I'm sittin' at a stoplight in northern town
I feel lucky
I drive somewhere out of range, I don't know where
White noise coming out of my brain
Turns off for nothing

Rockefella, my umbrella
God, I love you, baby
Storyteller, us forever
Is my favorite song

You've been acting pretty restless
Dancin' like the young and restless
And I'm obsessed with it
Candy necklaces
You've been acting pretty reckless
Dancing like the young and restless
And I'm obsessed with this
All his candy necklaces

Sittin' on the sofa, feelin' super suicidal
Hate to say the word, but, baby, hand on the Bible
I do feel like it's you the one who's bringing me down
Thought that we were cool, we were kicking it like Tribe Called Quest
You're the best, but, baby, you've been bringing me down
I can see it now

Rockafella, my umbrella
God I love you, baby
Fortune teller, favorite ever
Was the story of us

You've been acting pretty restless
Dancin' like the young and reckless
And I'm obsessed with this
Candy necklaces
I think that we should address this
Acting like the young and restless
I'm obsessed with this
All his candy necklaces

We've been acting pretty restless
Dancin' like the young and restless
I'm obsessed with this
Candy necklaces

Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces (Mm)
Candy necklaces (Mhm)
Candy necklaces (I'm obsessed with this)
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces ('Cause I'm obsessed with this)
Candy necklaces (Mm)
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces, oh

"Jon Batiste Interlude"

Oh
Ooh, I'm feelin' somethin' right now
I didn't know I was gon' feel it so early
I feel it early, I feel it
I feel it early
Woo, woohoo
I feel it early and I feel it late
Oh, my goodness
Yeah, I feel it
I feel it
I didn't know I was gonna feel it heavy
I feel it heavy

I am your honey
You're the sun dancing to the moon
Ah, ooh

Oh
Hold on, that's pretty cute, how about that
Early in the morning
Yeah
That's some []
Early in the morning
Oh, sweet
Sweet honey, oh

"Kintsugi"

There's a certain point the body can't come back from
In one year, we've learned the turn of the mouth
The depth that the chest cavity takes
Chucky was there for three out of three
I was there for the third 'cause I couldn't be
There for the one who was closest to me
But I can't say I'd run when things get hard
It's just that I don't trust myself with my heart
But I've had to let it break a little more
'Cause they say that's what it's for

That's how the light shines in
That's how the light shines in
That's how the light gets in

So everyone was there, they were standing and laughing
And I'm on the side with my tears streaming down
There's something about the clutch of the wrist
He thought mine was his to carve into his mouth
We've only got hours
And I just can't stop crying 'cause all of the ways
When you see someone dying
You see all your days flash in front of you
And you think about who would be with you
And then there's Donoghue

Daddy, I miss them
I'm in the mountains
I'm probably running away from the feelings I get
When I think of all the things about them
Daddy, I miss them
I'm at the Roadrunner Caf
I'm probably running away from the thoughts in the day
I had things to do with them, but they say

That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in

Think by the 3rd of March, I was cracked open
Finally the ground was cold, they wouldn't open
Brought by the sunlight of the spirit to pour into rain
There's a name for it in Japanese, it's kintsugi
They sang folk songs from the '40s
Even the fourteen-year old knew "Froggie Came A-Courtin'"
How do my blood relatives know all of these songs
I don't know anyone left to know songs that I sing

That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in

But daddy, I miss them
I'm at the Roadrunner Caf
Probably running away from the feelings today
In the snow-capped mountains of the desert
Daddy, I miss them
I'm in the mountains
Probably running away, I've been meaning to say
That there's nothing to do except know that this is

How the light gets in
Like the cracking, the light gets in
It's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
Then you're golden
Ah, ah, ah
Just another folk song, but anyway
I try so hard, but that's okay
It's how the light gets in
It's how the light gets in
It's how the light gets in

"Fingertips"

When I look back, tracing fingertips over plastic bags
Thinking, "I wish I could extrapolate some small intention
Or maybe just get your attention for a minute or two"

Will I die Or will I get to that ten-year mark
Where I beat the extinction of telomeres
And if I do, will you be there with me, Father, Sister, Brother

Charlie, stop smoking
Caroline, will you be with me
Will the baby be alright
Will I have one of mine
Can I handle it
Even if I do
You said that I might
It's not fair or so they said
To carry a child
I guess I'll be fine

It wasn't my idea the cocktail of things that twist neurons inside
But without them, I'd die
They say there's irony in the music, it's a tragedy
I see nothing Greek in it
Give me a mausoleum in Rhode Island with Dad, Grandma, Grandpa and Dave
Who hung himself real high
In the National Park sky, it's a shame and I'm crying right now
To get to you, save you if I take my life
Find your astral body, put it into my eyes
Give you two seconds to cry
Take you home, I, I'll give you a blanket
Your spirit can sit and watch TV by my side
'Cause, baby, I ran through a time when I felt you were doing it

I couldn't handle it, I was in Monaco
I couldn't hear what they said on the telephone
I had to sing for the prince in two hours
Sat in the shower
Gave myself two seconds to cry
It's a shame that we die

When I was fifteen, naked, next-door neighbors did a drive-by
Pulled me up by my waist, long hair to the beach side
I wanted to go out like you, swim with the fishes
That he caught on Rhode Island beaches
But, sometimes, it's just not your time

Caroline, what kind of mother was she to say I'd end up in institutions
All I wanted to do was kiss Aaron Greene and sit by the lake
Twisting lime into the drinks that they made
Have a babe at sixteen, the town I was born in and died

Aaron ended up dead and not me
What the fuck's wrong in your head to send me away never to come back
Exotic places and people to take the place of being your child
I give myself two seconds to cry
Let it crash over me like
The waves in the sea
Call me Aphrodite
As they bow down to me

Sunbather, moon chaser, queen of empathy
I give myself two seconds to breathe
And go back to being a serene queen
I just needed two seconds to be me

"Paris, Texas"
(feat. SYML)

I went to Paris (Texas)
With a suitcase in my hand
I had to leave
Knew they wouldn't understand

When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It's time, it's time to go
When you know, you know
Then the more you know
It's time to go

I took a trip to Spain
Just a notebook in my hand
Then I went to see some friends of mine
Down in Florence, Alabama

When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It's time, it's time to go
When you know, you know
That it's time to leave
Like the summer breeze

When everyone star's bright
Brighter than you are
It's time to go
And you're the only one left
Dancin' while theyre on the floor
Time to go

I flew back home
It seems everything's the same (Venice, California)
Except that you aren't home
Hello, I call to know why (But)

When you're home, you're home (Venice, California)
When you're home, you're home (Venice, California)
When you're home, when you're alone
When you're right, you're right
When you're right, you're right
Even when you're wrong

"Grandfather Please Stand On The Shoulders Of My Father While He's Deep-Sea Fishing"
(feat. RIOPY)

Three white butterflies to know you're near

I know they think, that it took somebody else
To make me beautiful (Beautiful)
As they intended me to be
But they're wrong
I know they think
That it took thousands of people
To put me together again
Like an experiment
Some big men behind the scenes
Sewing Frankenstein black dreams into my songs
But they're wrong

God, if you're near me send me three white butterflies
Or an owl to know you're listening, sitting while I'm drinking
Grandfather, please stand on the shoulders of my father
While he's deep-sea fishing for sharks in the Pacific
'Cause I'm good on spirit, warm-bodied
A fallible deity wrapped up in white
I'm folk, I'm jazz, I'm blue, I'm green
Regrettably, also a white woman

But I have good intentions even if I'm one of the last ones
If you don't believe me, my poetry or my melodies
Feel it in your bones
I have good intentions even if I'm one of the last ones
(Ah-ha-ah, yeah, ah-ha-ah, yeah, ah-ha-ah, yeah)

Grandfather, please stand on the shoulders of my father
While he's deep-sea fishing for all the things he's wishing
God, if you're near me, send me three white butterflies
Or a map to know Your vision, impart on me Your wisdom

It took somebody else to make me beautiful
Wonderful
As they intended me to be
But they're wrong

Three white butterflies to know you're near

"Let The Light In"
(feat. Father John Misty)

[Lana Del Rey]
Pick you up at home, quarter to three
Ask you if you want somethin' to eat
Drive around, get drunk, do it over again
Wake you up at night, quarter to one
I can never stop, wanna have fun
Don't be actin' like I'm the kinda girl who can sleep

'Cause every time you say you're gonna go
I just smile 'cause babe, I already know
You know I got nothin' under this overcoat

[Lana Del Rey & Father John Misty]
Ooh, let the light in
At your back door yelling 'cause I wanna come in
Ooh, turn your light on
Look at us, you and I, back at it again

[Lana Del Rey]
Pick you up around quarter to two
Usually we got nothin' to do
Screw it, maybe you should go and record some other songs
Got my dress on tight 'cause you know that I
Look shinin' in the light, there's so much ridin'
On this life and how we write a love song

[Lana Del Rey & Father John Misty]
Ooh, let the light in
At your back door yelling 'cause I wanna come in
Ooh, turn your light on
Look at us, you and I back at it again

[Lana Del Rey]
'Cause I love to love, to love, to love, to love you
I hate to hate, to hate, to hate you
Put the Beatles on, light the candles, go back to bed
'Cause I wanna, wanna, wanna want you
I need to, need to, need to need you
Put the TV on, flowers in a vase, lie your head

[Lana Del Rey & Father John Misty]
Ooh, let the light in
At your back door yelling 'cause I wanna come in
Ooh, turn your light on
Look at us, you and me back at it again

"Margaret"
(feat. Bleachers)

[Lana Del Rey]
This is a simple song, I'm gonna write it for a friend
My shirt is inside out, I'm messy with the pen
He met Margaret on a rooftop, she was wearing white
And he was like, "I might be in trouble"
He had flashes of the good life, he was like
"Should I jump off this building now or do it on the double"

[Lana Del Rey & Jack Antonoff]
'Cause, baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble

When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It kinda makes me laugh, running down that path
When you're good, it's gold
'Cause when you know, you know

[Jack Antonoff]
A word to all my friends
But there are red flags, they are not nice
There are black eyes and there are blue eyes
If you're asking yourself, "How do you know"
Then that's your answer, the answer is "No"
Yeah, gotta run, gotta run around like your head's on fire
Run away like your head is on fire

[Lana Del Rey & Jack Antonoff]
'Cause, baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble

[Lana Del Rey & Jack Antonoff, Lana Del Rey]
When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It kinda makes me laugh, running down that path
When you're good, it's gold
'Cause when you know, you know
When you're old, you're old
Like Hollywood in me, the diamond on your ring
The soul that you bring to the table
One that makes me see, eeh-eeh-eeh
In a minor key
'Cause when you know, you know
When you know, you know

[Lana Del Rey]
So, if you don't know
Don't give up
'Cause you never know what the new day might bring

[Lana Del Rey & Jack Antonoff]
Maybe tomorrow you'll know
Maybe tomorrow you'll know
Maybe tomorrow you'll know

[Lana Del Rey]
I mean, join the party
By the way, the party is December 18
(Okay, let's waltz this out, 'cause)

[Lana Del Rey & Jack Antonoff]
'Cause when you know, you know
When you're old, you're old
Like Hollywood in me, that diamond on your ring
The soul that you bring to the table

[Lana Del Rey]
One that makes me see, eeh-eeh-eeh
In a minor key
Diamond on your ring
'Cause when you know, you know
When you know, you know

"Fishtail"

Don't you dare say that you'll braid my hair, babe
If you don't really care
You wanted me sadder, you wanted me sadder
Fishtail is the matter, like that, ah-ah-ah

Skipping rope in the bayou, bayou
Slip softly into rain
Not that smart but I've got things to say
Palm trees in black and white
I like to watch them sway
You're so funny, I wish I could skinny-dip inside your mind
Lately I've been thinking about how things used to be
Swinging in a nightgown underneath the old oak tree
Almost Victorian with you, you can talk to me
But lately, I can't see

You wanted me sadder
You wanted me sadder
Baby, can't you see it
(You wanted me sadder)
For me, you are the one
And if I'm not the one for you
Don't you see it
I was on the stairs
Ella Fitzgerald in the air
Feelin' hella rare
Baby, if you care
Baby, don't you dare say
You'll braid my hair, babe
Don't you dare say
That you'll braid my hair
Babe, if you don't really care
You wanted me sadder

Dancing there in the hot out sun
I know that we've got problems
I plan to address them another day
Palm trees in black and white
I see in Technicolor
Maybe I'll take my glasses off so I'll stop painting red flags green
Lately I've been sunning in the L.A. river bed
Wearing nothing but the summer bruises on my knees
I like how you talk, how you speak, how you look at me
But lately, I can't see

You wanted me sadder
Baby, can't you see it
(You wanted me sadder)
For me, you are the one
If I'm not the one for you
Don't just see it
I was on the stairs
Ella Fitzgerald in the air
Feelin' hella rare
Baby, if you care
Baby, don't you dare say
You'll braid my hair
See, baby, if you care
Then, baby, don't you dare say
(Don't you dare say that you'll braid my hair, see)
That you really care
Don't you dare say that you'll braid my hair
When you get home tonight
If you don't really care
Yeah, don't you dare say that you'll braid my hair, babe
If don't really care, see
Don't you care say that you'll braid my hair if you're not coming home to me
Hmm-mm

You want someone sadder
Skipping rope in the bayou, bayou
Slip softly into rain
I'm not that smart
But I've got things to say

"Peppers"
(feat. Tommy Genesis)

[Tommy Genesis]
Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie
Hands on your knees, Angelina Jolie
Lemme put my hands on your knees, you can braid my hair
Do a fat criss cross in the back somewhere, ha

[Lana Del Rey]
Me and my boyfriend listen to the Chili Peppers
We write hit songs without trying like all the time, all the time
I take off all my clothes, dance naked for the neighbors
I'm like, "Fuck it, gonna give a show", I open up the blinds

I threw caution to the wind, get on to the bike
Take a minute to yourself, skinny dip in my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love
Got a knife in my jacket, honey, I'm divine
Baby, I'll bring the coffee if you bring the wine
I'm in love, I'm in love

My boyfriend tested positive for COV-, it don't matter
We've been kissing, so whatever he has, I have
I can't cry

I threw caution to the wind, get on to the bike
Take a minute for myself, skinny dip in my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love
Ah

[Tommy Genesis]
Hands on your knees, I'm Angelina Jolie

"Taco Truck x VB"

Met my boyfriend down at the taco truck
Pass me my vape, I'm feeling sick, I need to take a puff
Imagine if we actually gave a fuck
Wouldn't that be something to talk about for us
Caribbean blue in sweater weather, I'm falling into you
Although it seems I've gotten better, I can be violent too

That's why they call me Lanita
When I get down I'm bonita
Don't come find me in Reseda
I'll go crazy
Read my gold chain, says, "Lanita"
When I'm violent, it's Carlito's Way
Blood on my feet on the street
I'm dancin' crazy

Spin it 'til you whip it into a cream, baby
Print it to black and white pages don't faze me
Before you talk, let me stop what you're saying
I know, I know, I know that you hate me

Honey, I got up so early
And then, I got into the shower
I was just able to go back to sleep for a hour and a half
So that rocked, um, anyway (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
I had this dream where, um, aha, I don't know
(Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss)

You heard my baby's back in town now
You should come, come over
We'll be hanging around now
You should come, come over
Back, back to the garden
We're getting high now because we're older
Me myself, I like diamonds
Oh baby, crimson and clover

Oh God, I miss you on my lips
It's me, your little Venice Bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss

(Ah, shatter)
Calling out, bang bang, kiss kiss
(Ah, yeah, ah, shatter)
Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss
(Yeah, yeah)

Back in the garden
We're getting high now because we're older
Me myself, I like diamonds
But baby, crimson and clover
Wha-wha-wha-wha-whatever
Everything, whatever
Wha-wha-wha-wha-whatever
Everything's whatever

Oh God, I miss you on my lips (I do, I do)
It's me, your little Venice bitch (Yes, it is)
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss

(Ah, shatter)
Calling out, bang bang, kiss kiss
(Ah, yeah, ah, shatter)
Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss
(Yeah, yeah)

If you weren't mine (Get high), I'd be jealous of your love (Drunk acid)
If you weren't mine (Never die), I'd be jealous of your love (Not tonight, Lake Placid)
If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
(Oh, God, I miss you on my lips)
If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
(On the stoop with the neighborhood kids)
(Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss)
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss
Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss

"1949"

Carry me up them stairs
With my white socks on
And my pretty song
You like my blue nail polish
What is all this You said
Of the mess upstairs
Don't be scared

Daddy dearest, you know
How I like to take trips
Pops, first stops at the K-Mart, buy me my peach lip-gloss
Cigarettes and lollipops
For our trip across the USA

We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in the Pontiac from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Gonna party like it's 1949

Carry me up the stairs
With my white socks on
And my blonde hair long
You like my pin-up bodice and the solace
That comes with the midnight air
And my icy stare

It's the clearest when it's me and him alone
He stops, he talks about all the ways he used
To about all ways he used to []
Dinerettes and soda pops for our trip across the USA

We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in the Pontiac from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Gonna party like it's 1949

Daddy likes Blackpool Pleasure Beach and road stops
Me, I like the Swiss Alps souvenir gift shops
Late night, midnight radio show talks
Him and me, a big jailbreak

Ponytail and lollipops, dinerettes and soda pops
New blue bathing suit, ruched tops and Cadillacs
Blue lake, Carter Docks, hopscotch, hot talk
Alabama hard knocks, motel brass locks

"Afraid"

I'm America's sweetheart
Tryna get away
You make it hard to leave
But it's easier for me to stay
Why I'm so afraid

And I've had it up to here
With the fighting, baby, we're
Not fooling anyone these days
I don't wanna stray
But boy, I'm so afraid

But it's not love that keeps me here
And it's not what you want to hear

So I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
And I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
Thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid

We were just teenagers when we fell in love
Driving in your fast car
Looking at the stars above
But it was not enough
You should never come between
A woman and her dream
And a man who never knew his place
There's no easy way
To come back from where you came

So, I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
I-I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
Nothing in your heart, boy
I thought that I could make you change
But I'm so afraid

And it's not love, it's just the fear
That you've put down for all these years

But I'm leaving now
I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
I am done being afraid
Oh, I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
I thought that I could make you change
But I'm so afraid

Oh, it's not love that keeps me here
It's not love that keeps me here
I'm done being afraid
I'm done being afraid
Oh, oh, oh

"All Smiles"

All dressed up, with nowhere to go
That's the story of the girl you know
Me
I'm all smiles but inside I frown
'Cause I've seen you walking around with Betty Lou
Didn't I tell you what I heard about her

It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you what them other girls do
You'll date anyone, you'll date anyone

Are they more fun than me, baby
I'm smiling, the New Jersey queen
And you're the best thing I ever seen
So won't you pull up your white corvette
Jimmy, let me get a better look at your face
I know it ain't doing
But I know what you like
So come on inside and I'll fix you ice-cream
A little banana split for you, Jim

You're so fine, you're like silk la roux
Guess that's why you keep slipping through my fingers
You're the state's number one
Everybody knows it
You smile all the time
'Cause how can you not show it
When even you know
That you're so
To die for, to die for
What do I need to get high for
When I have you
When I have you

It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you what those other girls done
I'm gonna prove to you
I'm gonna prove to you
You'll never find nobody more fun

Dah, dah, dah
More fun

"Angels Forever"

"Architecture"
(The Next Best American Record Demo)

My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
To the Houses of the Holy, smoking on them cigarettes
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was cool as heck, he was cool as heck

But you were so obsessed with writing
The next best American record
That there was nothing left by the time we got to bed
Baby, that's a shame
You were so obsessed with writing
The next best American record
You did it all for fame
You did it all for fame

You did it all for fame
Tell me how it treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out
You did it all for fame
Baby, how's life treating you now that it's over

My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was seventies in spirit, nineties in his frame of mind
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
We lost track of space, we lost track of time

But you were so obsessed with writing
The next best American record
That there was nothing left by the time we got to bed
Baby, that's a shame
You were so obsessed with writing
The next best American record
You did it all for fame

Baby, how you feeling now that I told ya

It's you, all the roads lead to you
Everything I want and do
All the things that I say
It's true, all the roads lead to you
Like the 405 I drive through
Every night and every day
I see you for who you really are
Why the thousands of girls love the way Bill plays guitar

You did it all for fame
Tell me how life treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out
You did it all for fame
Honey, how's life feeling now that it's over
Baby, how's life treating you now that I told ya

You've been pretty stupid
Ever since you got famous

Uh-oh, uh-oh, wrong side
Of the tracks, boy
Uh-oh, uh-oh, if only
We'd go backward

'Cause nobody does it like you
I like the way that you move
That's why I never go through
With leaving you

Everybody's saying that
You're no good for me

Crazy and shameless in love

You can mow the lawn for money
I can make you playlists
You bought me dimebags
Felt like we were famous

Uh-oh, uh-oh, best I
Ever had boy
Uh-oh, uh-oh, can you
Remember that, boy

Nobody knew what we knew
We had it figured out too
Us against the world just

If you wanted heaven, baby
Sit back in my pink Cadillac

Everybody's saying that
You're no good for me
Your friends all swear
That you've changed but
I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder
Of how it all used to be

"Backfire"

Salvatore, you can def be my baby blue
Be my mafiosi rock 'n' roll high
Back to Malibu in our trailer park for two
We're like Sid and Nancy loving the fight

We got a jumper
Got a jumper
Got a jumper
Got a jumper
My man's crazy and his mind isn't right
But I like him, fact, I love him
I can't get e-enough of him
He knows only I can save him tonight

I've been waiting on your love
Baby, for too long now, too long now
I thought that I could change you like the others
But I don't know how, don't know how
It's gonna backfire
It's gonna backfire, baby
Gonna backfire, gonna backfire, baby
Told you a million times before
Yes, I'm up for it a million more

I'm tired of fighting you
Seems like everything I do
Even when I win, I lose with you, man
And it's not something you choose
You say trouble follows you
It's been like that since the day you began

We got a jumper
Got a jumper
Got a jumper
Got a jumper
I know very well you're bringing me down
I will follow, I will follow
For a little piece of heaven
I am ready, I am willing to drown

I've been waiting on your love
Baby, for too long now, too long now
I thought that I could change you like the others
But I don't know how, don't know how
It's gonna backfire
It's gonna backfire, baby
Gonna backfire, gonna backfire, baby
We've done it a million times before
Yes, I'm up for it a million more

We're always taking trips downtown
Officer Brown's always coming around
Tapping on our windows, "Kids, come out
Ain't no way to live, let me show you how."
But we know we're not gonna change
Keep hustling every night and day

I've been waiting on your love
Baby, for too long now, too long now
I thought that I could change you like the others
But I don't know how, don't know how

It's gonna backfire
It's gonna backfire, baby
Gonna backfire, gonna backfire, baby
Done it a million times before
And I'll run for it a million more

"Bad Boy"

My baby likes me fresh in my white kicks
I'm sweet like cherry pie, and he likes this
I buy him drinks and he buys me cigarettes
He thinks that we're a little bit like Romeo and Juliet
Throw me 'round like a hot potato, if he want the butter, then say so
It's wrong, but well, it's okay though
It's okay though

Baby ghetto love
Mama knows I like the bad boys
Baby ghetto love
Just like daddy was a bad boy
Ooh, aah
Take me out tonight, baby save my life
Ooh, ooh

True love, true love, true love
It never dies, it never dies, it never dies
True love, true love, true love
It never dies, it never dies

My baby likes me fresh in my white kicks
He thinks it's a little like hair, tits, lips, sips
It doesn't really matter that I do my lipstick all day long, all day long
My baby likes me fresh in my white kicks
Dear Bonnie and Clyde, it's just like this
He thinks a little like my polka dot dress on
He like my hair long

Baby ghetto love
You know no one loves you better
Baby ghetto love
You can be oh be no better
Ooh, ooh
Take me out tonight, baby save my life
Ooh, ooh
Take me out tonight, baby save my life

Save my life, save my life, save my life
Save my life, save my life, save my life
Save my life, save my life, save my life
'Cause true love never dies
It's what I want
When I see what's up high
True love never dies

Baby ghetto love
Mama knows I like the bad boys
Baby ghetto love
Just like daddy was a bad boy
True love, true love, true love
It never dies, it never dies, it never dies
True love, true love, true love
It never dies, it never dies

"Beautiful Player"

Uh, what Starz, Starz
Lana Del Rey, Lana Del Rey
Sing it to me, sing it to me

You're so easy to love
You make me cuckoo like a turtle dove
So hot that I can't get enough, enough of you
Hit me and it felt like a kiss
You know it hurts so good, when you do me like this
So sad when I hear the girls talk
When I walk by, I start to cry-y-y

(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause you're a beautiful player
You're a beautiful player, baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that)
Ooh ooh oh oh, ah, ah, ah
(Sing it to me, doll)

Sunset on a Saturday night
Having a drop-top 'bach-ride time of our lives
He's selling souls on the boulevard of broken dreams
And faded queens
Live young like we oughta die fast
'Cause he's been breaking the law and he's not going back (going back)
I love him violently all through the night
And yes it's true, I live for you-oo-oo

(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause you're my beautiful player
(Sing it to me)
You're my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that)
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh, oh, yeah

L is for your love that you gave and took away
O is for the only one I wanted to stay
V is for my valiant Valium baby
E is for the  that we took with champagne

I don't wanna leave, I just wanna breathe
I drive 'em crazy, baby girl, just being me
I'm not selfish, I can't help it
I was playing the cards I was dealt-ed
The name Starz got a lot of love to give
Riding down Broke Dream Boulevard in the Benz
How you love that I think too much
A thin line between insanity and true love

Hit me and it felt like a kiss
Baby if it don't hurt, then I'll have to insist
We have just one life to live
But true love's more than he can give

(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause he's my beautiful player
He's my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that)
Ooh ooh oh oh, ah, ah, ah

'Cause he's my beautiful player
(Sing it to me)
He's my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby

"Because Of You"

On the streets of L.A.
Where the future is now
We dance like nobody is watching us
And we live like we want to
But it can also get a little crazy
Unless there's something to hold on to
For me, that was true love

I was a young girl, selfish and wild
Like a fire in L.A.
Hot like the summer and mean like a child
Who keeps crying 'til she gets her way
(Like a true star)

There were roses in my hair
Rock and roll on blare and I was in trouble
No one could rock me like you could
I was a bad girl gone good

Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
And it brought me to my knees
And it's all because of you
(You know what I'm talking about)

It was a mad world, we lived for fun
And we got shit for free
Had a face like an angel but inside my heart
Was as black as a broke movie screen
(It was pretty sad)

But then I saw you standing there
Like a millionaire, give me your number
Call me before I get stupid
Make me uncrazy like you did

Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
But you brought me to my knees
And it's all because of you

It isn't hard to see you've got a hold on me
Give me your money, love me to death
Talk like a baby cause I'm so elated
He tell me that I ain't seen nothing quite yet
I don't wanna lose it
I'm in love but I didn't choose it

Roses in my hair, dancing in the air
Feels like I'm flying
Tell me you love me, boy, do it
It's just like I thought, I just knew it

Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
You bring me to my knees
And it's all because of you
Yeah, it's all because of you

"Behind Closed Doors"

I like 'em mad, bad baby, you could be the one
If you wanna get trashed and have fun
Throw me wholly in the sky like a pizza pie (Are you crazy)
You take my whole world, baby, and twist it to the right
Throw me in the air and whoop like dynamite
Baby you know anytime you can swing by

You know I like 'em bad, boy
Wrong side of the track, boy, oh
You know I like 'em bad boy, like you
(Like you, you know I do)
I like a man with kick, yeah
So come around and hit me up
No other man can lick me like you
(Like you, you know what you do)

Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
I'm not gonna do it, baby (no way)
Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
You only show a little but you give me more
Behind, behind, behind
Behind closed doors
(No one can see us)
(I know you like me)

I see my best friends kissing
Touching all the time
But I don't need no jet to write it in the sky
I see it in his eyes, I'm his cherry pie

You know I like 'em bad, boy
They think you make me sad, boy, no
The best I ever had, boy, it's you
(Like you, you know I do)
I want a man that's hot, yeah
To come around and rock me, yeah
No one can dirty talk me
(Like you, you know what you do)

Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
I'm not gonna do it, baby (no way)
Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
You only shout a little but you give me more
Behind, behind, behind
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

Everybody's at the park tonight
Everybody's at the shore
Everybody's on the street tonight
What the hell would we do that for
Everybody's at the park tonight
But we got fireworks galore, behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
I'm not gonna do it, baby (no way)
Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
You only shout a little but you give me more
Behind, behind, behind
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

"Ben"

Ben's song, another try
Not that you deserve it right now, Ben
No faculties to care and all
But I deserve it, I deserve it, I know
(We can quibble over the history once we make it)
Right

Lie down, my sad executive love, lie down
Right now, my man, bored out of his head, right now
Fans turn on a May night
Darkness assumes the room
Lie back, he does, in the late night
Hands folded back
Certain of doom
Hold me he sang "Hallelujah"
The midnight's became my noon
You don't know what you do, do ya
I am on fire for you
I'm on fire, I'm on fire

Lie down, my sad executive love, lie down
Right now, my man, bored out of his head, right now
Fans turn on a May night
Darkness assumes the room
Hold me, hmm
Hold me he say "Hallelujah"
The midnight's became my noon
You don't know what you do, do ya
I am on fire for you
I'm on fire, I'm on fire

Lie down, my sad executive love, lie down
I can smoke if I want to
I can dance if I want to
Yeah, it's true I want you
But don't say you don't want no harm
If you can't understand
'Cause I won't be here long enough for you to be my man

It's not a very nice ending, but that's what you get, just kidding

God bless America
Land that I love
Stand beside her
And guide her
I don't know anything, hm

There you are

"Bentley"

He drive up in a summer sky, blue Bentley
Death reflecting in his eyes
Thought about all the women who loved me
I said, "Oh no"
He said, "Get inside"
I said, "Oh no"
He said, "Get inside"

I got into his summer sky, blue Bentley
Sun reflecting in my eyes
Thought about all the fun I had lately
I said, "Uh huh" I said "I want to drive"
I said, "Uh huh I want, I want to drive"
We drive, we drive

You say you wanna go swimming in my ring
It's green and shimmering
Like my lipstick, the color of dawn
Like my lipstick, the color of dawn
We got out of his summer sky, blue Bentley

Death reflecting in the sky
He held my hand to the ocean he lead me
I said, "Uh huh, I want, I want to die"
"Uh huh, I want, I want to die."

"Big Bad Wolf"

I told you not to go into the woods
I told you that he wasn't any good
I told you not to go into the woods
I told you that he wasn't any good

I'll take the wrong path
I think I've gone a little off track
And now there's no way back
You took all the apples that I had

But I heart you and I wanna be your girl
I heart you and I know you'll rock my world

'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up
(I told you not to go into the woods)

Big, bad, naughty rock star
Your claws are shining bright in the dark
Lifting up my little red skirt
I know you'll leave me here in the dirt

But I heart you, and I wanna be your girl
I heart you, so come back and rock my world

'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up

Life is like, like a little game
That we like to play, just for fun, just for fun
Yeah, we take nothing seriously, nothing's wrong, make me run, all night long
Hide and seek is how you play with me
Oh, you're tempting me, just for fun, just for fun
I hear you calling me over city streets, through the trees, mess with me, then you'll leave
Oh, be still my heart, escaping in your cherry-red car

'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up
'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up

"Big Eyes"
(from "Big Eyes" soundtrack)

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

I saw you creeping around the garden what are you hiding
I beg your pardon, don't tell me "nothing"
I used to think that I could trust you
I was your woman
You were my knight and shining companion

To my surprise
My love's demise
Was his own greed
And lullabies

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

I noticed you got hot in summer
You had no comfort
Your shirt was cotton
Your face was sunburned
You paced around like you'd been waiting
Waiting for something
Your world was burning and I stood watching

As I looked on
The flames grew high
You watched me frown
I said "goodbye"

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

Is it me, was I wrong to have trusted you
Did I see what I wanted, what wasn't true
Was I wrong to go on like a little fool
It's amazing what women in love will do

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

"Big Spender"

"Blizzard"

Caught up in a blizzard yesterday
Ought to be alone, or so I say
I needed a change of scenery
She was really starting to annoy me

I went out shopping and planned to go to all them vintage stores
Then I got tired and ended up in some lame department store
And that's okay, cause I found a really cool belt and

I feel like I'm in high school again
Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say
I don't have to be sad like you

I have a commitment Friday night
First I say my prayer then I'm alright
I sit in my chair, you dim the light
When I look I stare with inner sight

I feel like I'm in high school again
Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say
I don't have to be sad like you

Met up with some friends for Thai food
I liked it but wasn't in the mood
Can't you see that I'm just feeling blue
What I do's got nothing to do with you

I feel like I'm in high school again
Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say
I don't have to be sad like you

"Boarding School"

Everyone from home
Says that you're so cool
Come on, everybody
To the boarding school
Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down
To the boarding school

L-L-Let's do drugs
Make love with our teachers
Come on, date a townie

Everyone from home

Come on, everybody
To the boarding school
Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool

With American flags on each little finger
You're crashing on Wall Street
While I'm blowing up as a singer

If you wanna get that scholarship
Yale's not a problem, let's solve it
Educated in the language of doing it
Get down like your tutor taught you to

You thought that I was just a calendar kitten
But now you heard me purring, tiger, you're smitten
So let's begin to major in the art of sinning

"Bollywood Hawaii"

Every time you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I can't see
He's someone I have never talked about
Cause I know that we'd both be dead if you found out
Every time you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something that I've been withholding
I'm not like every other girl

Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for

So if you begin to think that
My light might be supernatural
I'd have to say you're right
"You're right, mon cher, it is"
I came from a place that your mind can not even imagine
We say "Maha, mahaha, mahaha, maha"
And we sing

Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for

I need your love babe
I need your loving
I need your love babe
I need your loving

"Break My Fall"

The greatest line in history
Baby it's not you, it's me
What you think I'm dumb, dumb, baby doll
I'm big enough and bad enough
And I can tell when things get rough
Now nothing that you say can break my fall

Oh, oh
Stop right there
Oh, oh
If you really care

Don't go and blow it all, it's bad enough baby
I don't wanna hear you saying it's not you, it's me
If there's blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you're done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There's nothing you can say to break my fall

Greatest lie in history
Baby it's not you, it's me
Do you really think I'll buy your bullshit boy
Ooh-oh-oh-oh
Give a girl her self respect
You haven't gone and hurt me yet
But you know that I'll crumble if you call

Oh, oh
Stop right there
Oh, oh
If you really care

Don't go and blow it all, it's bad enough baby
I don't wanna hear you saying it's not you, it's me
If there's blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you're done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There's nothing you can say to break my fall

Break my fall
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I'm not gonna let you become a martyr
Not gonna let you pick up the gun
I'm gonna make this a whole lot harder
Won't make it easy for you to run
I'm not gonna let you become a martyr
Not gonna let you pick up the gun
I'm gonna make this a whole lot harder
Won't make it easy for you to run

Don't go and blow it all, it's bad enough baby
I don't wanna hear you saying it's not you, it's me
If there's blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you're done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There's nothing you can say to break my fall
Don't go and blow it all, it's bad enough baby
I don't wanna hear you saying it's not you, it's me
If there's blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you're done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There's nothing you can say to break my fall

"Buddy's Rendezvous"

Everybody's girl
What's the point in
Being everybody's girl
Maybe you think that way
There's no chance getting hurt
Living for no one cost me way
More than it's worth

So you're gonna be a singer
Well I'll be goddamn
You're as pretty as a postcard
No thank to the old man
It's the same coat I had on
The night that I went in
I can stay an hour at Canter's
The streets cool off by then

When can I see you again
Whatever happened to the girl
I knew
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Whatever happened to the girl
I knew
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Everything you want
What's the fun in getting
Everything you want
I wouldn't know but, look
Baby you should try
Forget that lefty shit
Your mom drilled in your mind

Give the world a new savior
Sell his pictures to the press
Buy a place out in the country
Leave this world for
Someone else
My destruction is an hour late
I'm at Buddy's Rendezvous
Telling the losers
And old-timers
How good I did with you
They almost believe me too
Whatever happened to the girl
I knew
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Whatever happened to the girl
I knew
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news
Whatever happened to the girl
I knew
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Whatever happened
Whatever happened

"Butterflies"

We're sipping cocktails, looking down upon the riot
You whisper "Baby, love the way you look tonight
I wanna save you, save you from the world outside."
I know it seems you're all I wanted and much more
But then, to tell the truth, I've been through this before
They say "I'll save you, save you", but they never do

I think you know I want to believe you
But in my heart, I know that I'll leave you
It's sort of sad how instincts deceive you, or does it please you
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you've done makes me wanna run, run

I made the decision that I can't be with you
Walking out the door but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies
I make the decision that I'm too good for you
Then I see you're calling, it's hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies

Well back in high school, in the yard, we used to fight
But you would sneak in through my window every night
"I wanna take you, take you to the world outside"
Well, I assume it's what I wanted at the time (oh, at the time)
But your eyes were like a constant warning sign (oh, warning sign)
"I wanna take you, take you" and I didn't mind

And even then I didn't believe you (no)
You had a smile so easy to see through
I know a little part of me will always need you (yes)
Try to reach you, try to please you (what)
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you done makes me wanna run, run

I made the decision that I can't be with you
Walking out the door but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies
I make the decision that I'm too good for you
Then I see you're calling, it's hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies

I know, I know, I know, we aren't good together
I can't let go, I'm sure that we should be forever

I look around, there's no one above you
I think you know that I'll always love you
And baby, I'm bad too, it's not just you
But I can't wait forever to trust you
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you've done makes me wanna run, run

I made the decision that I can't be with you
Walking out the door but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies
I make the decision that I'm too good for you
Then I see you're calling, it's hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies

"Butterflies (Part 2)"

You're hot for God, but we all got a hunch that
Maybe you've gone astray
Control yourself, but it's so hard
When you can look so good on Sunday
I know he knows that I knew what he's thinking
I know he knows
I know he knows that what he's doing is wrong
But I just tell him, "Go on, sing a sad song."

My baby has an eye for pretty things, pretty things
He thinks that little girls are butterflies and clips their wings
Sicko, psycho, sicko, but he's my beau
Puts them on a roller coaster, lures them in with Coca-Cola

Boy, you've been catching butterflies
All the girls believe your lies, don't they
Boy, you can pin me up if you like
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby
You give me butterflies
You're catching butterflies
You give me butterflies, I'm fluttering, fluttering high

You're hot to trot, but boy, you got a
Secret that you cannot betray
He likes it hot, you're burning up
But baby boy, your secret is safe
I know he know that I knew what he's thinking
I know he know
I know he know that what he's teaching is wrong
But, honey, this preacher's song has got me too far gone

My baby has an eye for girls who sing, girls who sing
He's lucky I'm the type, that's his thing, that's his thing
Sicko, psycho, sicko, but he's my beau
Dresses up in rings and rollers, poses as a Holy Roller

Boy, you've been catching butterflies
All the girls believe your lies, don't they
Boy, you can pin me up if you like
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby
You give me butterflies
You're catching butterflies
You give me butterflies, I'm fluttering, fluttering high

His butterflies are in a golden cage, safe and bound
He puts on "Lola" by The Kinks and he dances 'round
And he's so happy that his feet don't even touch the ground
And I'm in love cause I was lost and now I'm finally found

Boy, you've been catching butterflies
All the girls believe your lies, don't they
Boy, you can pin me up if you like
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby
You give me butterflies
You're catching butterflies
You give me butterflies, I'm fluttering, fluttering

Fluttering, fluttering
Fluttering, fluttering
Fluttering
(Psycho, sicko, psycho)

"C U L8R Alligator"

Don't say I'll see you later alligator, so cute
When you know it's not true
I know you're seeing her
But you can still see me, too
If you wanted to, baby

I know they say I'm cheap
And you're two-timing me
That's what you get
We're in the 21st century
So much for chivalry
I know you'll come to me
I have a way with men like you, baby

You're all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic's flawed and you've been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your little baby come, oh, come to you
When you gonna let me drive you crazy like nobody do
You're all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know you're scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby
When you gonna love your baby

I did the Playboy dip that made us famous
And you was watching there with your crew
I should have known just by the circumstances and who
I was meeting you through
That you were bad news

I know that's not the way
Most people meet but, hey
We're living in the fast lane
Post-modern day
You're not sure you can change
Or get out of the game
You're not the only one
I've heard say, "Maybe."

You're all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic's flawed and you've been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your baby tie you up and drive you crazy
You're all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know you're scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby
When you gonna love your baby

"California"
(unreleased, Honeymoon outtake)

Look at that, I'm walking around like I just don't care
Why is that Cause baby I don't now that I'm here
Look at me, I'm staying up late in my blue suede shoes
Shake it up, I'm dancing all night to the dirty blues

I like the light that shines on the water
I love the waves that break on the shore
I love the heat, can't get any hotter
And every night we dance, I love you even more

California, land that I love I'm not turning back
California, now that I'm home I'm not going back
California, I'm coming for ya
California, I'm coming for ya

Look at that, I'm walking around like I just don't care
Wildin' out, shaking it off shaking out my hair
I'm leanin' back, leaning so far I'm lyin' in the air
You're the man, and God it feels good just to say that, yeah

Like a dream, you glide on the water
And like a star I shine from the shore
Like the sun, can't get any hotter
You're the one I want, I won't look anymore

California, land that I love I'm not turning back
California, now that I'm home I'm not going back
California, I'm coming for ya
California, I'm coming for ya

He's my happy ending
Where the stars collide
Angels in the moonlight
Only you and I

California, land that I love I'm not turning back
California, now that I'm home I'm not going back
California, I'm coming for ya
California, I'm coming for ya

Boy you look so fine, fine

"Catch & Release"

So, I heard you wanna go to Rio, baby
Yes, I seen page six lately, ah
I told you both them broads was crazy
Hacking in your phone and shit
Diamonds and pearls, your little girl
She got the best, sparkling like a Hollywood movie, ah-ah-ah

If you got the cash, lock it down tight
I got the looks, you got my heart right
And you love me, 'cause I'm just like neon
Lighting up your night

Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
I didn't want nothing from you
Just to be like you, my king

I thought that you wanted a real girl, baby
You lured me in with all your gold
Catch and release, and you're so cold
Are you crazy
You didn't know what kinda fish you caught
'Cause I am a shark, beware of my bark
I'll eat you up like the center of a tootsie pop

'Cause we were a match in heaven, high
Only one catch, Frank was the boss, right
And it's so sad, 'cause the only way
That you know how to love is fight

Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
I didn't want nothing from you
Just to be like you, my king

Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
Give it to me, give it to me, everything

You know how I like my world on a string

"Caught You Boy"

Everything you do, everything I like
On the radio, dancing in the night
Flowers in my hair, roses on the vine
You can be my guy, and I'm your baby, right

My, my, apple of my eye
Looking really hot while I make ya cherry pie
Show me what you got, got a sparkle in your eye
You're so high

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

Every way I move, every way you like
Pulling on my dress, holding me too tight
I know we'll probably lose, only got tonight
But I love the way we kiss, love the way we fight

Like the way the bling on your pinkie ring shine
You spin me really fast and you catch me in the sky

Thunder in the air, trouble on my mind
Hold me in the dark, kiss it all behind

A dangerous army of one and I caught

"Children Of The Bad Revolution"

Take me in your fast car, Mercedes
Kissing on your neck while you drive, he, he
Doesn't care, I'm always on my Blackberry
All the time, all the time, buying into every lie

I'm a flashy little lush, but he thinks I'm really fine
Notorious and wild, takes me where I'm gonna shine
Where the bad boys roll hard, dressing like James Dean
And the vixen starlets feels so good to be

We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Get free

Baby, we are chancers on the scene
Glamour in the gutters, only so RT
Sick graffiti artists and tabloid queen
Mix it up, mix it up
Every 'do you've ever seen

We're acting really tough
Like the world belongs to us
Cause it does, yeah, it must
What we do creates the buzz
Where the bad boys blow smoke
Just like they're James Dean
And the it girls blow kisses
Just like Marilyn

We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Get free

Run for our lives
Break outta the chains
So cutting edge
Create our own games
DJs, rock stars, posers we are
The new politicians
The celebrity editions
And it's so pornographic, then it's tragic
Nothing magic makes us free
To be what we wanna be, wanna be

We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Get free
We're gonna get free, oh

Peace, we can't have it

Please, you've got habits
And you won't stop it (stop it)

And I threw all your stuff out of my window, and I didn't even blink an eye

Before the dawn or the valley shines

Girls with pink lips cultivate the sound
They watch, we kiss on a bed of roses
As he lays me down

Said that LSD could be good for me
Lay down, lay down

Makes them believe that there's nothing wrong
Parades me 'round like his fucking daughter
All the way, bow down

"Damn You"

I won't cry myself to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
Now, you fall asleep with another
Damn you

'Member how we used to escape for the summer
Fireworks and sparklers would light up the black skies
We'd hold on tight for our lives to each other
Hello, hello, where did you go

We were two kids living life on the run
Like the American dream, baby
Nothing to lose and we'd get messed up for fun
We went too fast, too young

But I won't cry myself to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
Now, you fall asleep with another
Damn you
Damn you

Flowers in my hair, and your breath smelled like whiskey
Promise anywhere that I go, take you with me
Dancing on your feet, like a child, to the radio
Hello, hello, where did you go

We were two kids living life on the run
Of the American dream, baby
Nothing to lose and we'd get messed up for fun
We went too fast, too young

But I won't cry my self to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
Now, you fall asleep with another
Damn you
Damn you
Damn you
Damn you

Every once in a lifetime
Dreams can come true
Now and then, when the stars shine
You meet somebody like you

And I won't cry myself to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
I pray your life is sweet, you fucker
Damn you
Oh, oh, damn you
Damn you

Chic, delicious, sweet tart
Sipping on my Diet Coke
Singing in the trailer park

"Daytona Meth"

It's like a Hollywood movie
The black and white waves sparkling truly
My man likes to watch me while I watch TV
While he's t-t-touching me

I remember vintage green wallpaper
Your criminal arms, I couldn't feel safer
King Creole daddy, chasing that paper
I l-l-love you

Baby you'll never be old in my eyes
With your golden grill true love never dies
We're forever young in paradise
As long as you got the Chevrolet, I will ride
I will ride
I will ride

Baby you know mama never had much money
But I plan on using this face to pay, honey
Give me give me give me give
You're so funny, love you 'til I die

Who's living life like it's the Belvedere
Swinging all night on the crystal chandelier
Bring that velvet Elvis over here

Come on, baby you never know 'til you try
Baby you never live 'til you die
Baby you never love 'til you're mine
C'mon you're mine, you're mine, you're mine

"Dragonslayer"

She is a Spanish seorita
Her eyes are green and her heart is gold
You have a vision, you'd like to meet her
And so you're walking down that road to the sea

You hear a lot of things about her
Her reputation's widely known
The people talk but that don't matter
Because to you she feels like home
You feel free because

She'll never bring you down
You're hot, then she'll bring you water
She wears a flower crown
She is the people's daughter
She's holy, holy
Maria's prayer, the dragonslayer
She's fighting fire by the sea

She is a Spanish la Lolita
Her eyes are green and her dress is gold
She is a siren, la femme Nikita
Her children young but her soul is old
She feels free

She'll never bring you down
You're tired, she'll bring you water
She'll never leave this town
She is the father's daughter
She's holy, holy
Maria's prayer, the dragonslayer
She's fighting fire by the sea
Maria's prayer, if you should see her
Give her my best wishes for me

Holy, dragonslayer
These troubled waters
They don't mean nothing to you
Patron saint of troubled daughters
Hold your light and you have it true
Because you're holy, you're holy
Holy, holy, you're holy, holy

Mariah's prayer, the dragonslayer
She's fighting fire by the sea
Mariah's prayer, if you should see her
Give her my best wishes for me

"Dreamgirl"

I can be your dream girl
I can be your dream girl

When you wake up to the day
And see the city, dark and gray
You can already see the curtain coming down
Sitting, open up your files
Right click JARs to see her smile
Transfer to your heart, and let the world go 'round
Shoo-wop shoo, baby

I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
When it all gets too much
Darling, I'm soft to the touch
Hush, hush and stop your rushing
I can be your dream girl, baby

iPhone ringing, boss is screaming
On the TV, news streaming
It means nothing to you though, you tune it out
Close your eyes and change the station
Switch the pictures on your wavelength
Put me on your playlist, I'm your favorite song
Shoo-wop shoo, baby

I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
When it all gets too much
Darling, I'm soft to the touch
Hush, hush and stop your rushing
I can be your dream girl, baby

Candlelight burns twice as bright, baby burns half as long
So keep your fire burning, so you always love me strong
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Whoa-whoa
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Whoa, baby
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Whoa-whoa
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Whoa, baby

Now it's night time, driving uptown
City's sparkling, but you shut down
So you signal right and turn your engine off
Cars fly by you, stars beside you
Turn that radio inside you
Tune the station that's playing the one you love
Shoo-wop shoo, baby

I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
I can be your dream girl
When it all gets too much
Darling, I'm soft to the touch
Hush, hush and stop your rushing
I can be your dream girl, baby
I can be your dream girl, baby

"Drive"

I've been out on that open road
You can be my full-time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
You can be my full-time baby, hot or cold

Don't break me down (Me down, me down)
I've been traveling too long (Too long, too long)
I've been trying too hard
With one pretty song (Hmm-hmm)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just drive, just drive
Just drive, just drive

Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life an art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it
Light 'til dark

Don't leave me now (Me now, me now)
Don't say goodbye (Goodbye, goodbye)
Don't turn around
Leave me high and dry (Hmm-hmm)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
I just drive, just drive
Just drive, just drive

You think I'll ever feel different than I do now
You think I'll ever feel any magic again
You think I'll ever transform into the man
God meant to make when he began

Hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
I just drive, just drive
Just drive, just drive

"Driving In Cars With Boys"

They say I'm wasting time, they say that I'm no good
Summer of my life, not doing what I should
Call me poison ivy 'cause I'm far from good
But pretty from afar, like a dark star

They think I'm dangerous, they think I'm really bad
I'm just making up for what I never had
Go out every night whenever I feel sad
All this drive-by love got me crazy like a drug

I wear my red lipstick, got my make-up on
Stumble into trouble, siren with a sad song
They all got girlfriends but I'm the one that they want
Miss America with the blue mascara on

I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock 'n' roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know

Mommy's Mercedes or Billy's pick-up truck
Come home late at night and baby picks me up
Tell him just drive on and d-don't ever stop
Don't take me home again, take me to a new land

I wear my red lipstick, grab my coat and gun
Wonder if this is it, it's darkest before dawn
Sometimes I wanna give in but I just have to go on
Miss America now I'm gone, baby, gone

I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding 'round town drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock'n'roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know

I was born to live fast, die young
Leave a beautiful corpse, live my life on the run
I got my cash and my Louis Vuitton, diamonds and guns
Girls just wanna, just wanna have fun

I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding 'round town drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go

I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go

French vanilla ice cream
Just the way I like
Dripping on your windscreen
I can't get a bite
Guess we could be more than friends
'Cause this kiss won't end
And you got me trembling

Touch me to ignite
Boy, you're a wild thing
Rocking on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you're dynamite

Speeding through the wasteland
Sparkling in the lights
Roll up to the boardwalk
Derelict delight
Eyes all on my dress again

"Elvis (Demo)"

Platinum and vale acrylics
Skim the paper for the critics
Baby's breathing Elvis lyrics
On the copper bar
Late in motel lounges singing
Spotlight on the band is swinging
Chateau Marmont memories fading
Hope is very far

Elvis, where are you when I need you most
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my Chantilly lace catching
Baby, on the chandelier

Sweeping scents and blue hydrangea
Summer hail and summer stranger
Baby, he's in constant danger
Help is very far
You look like a Florida native
"Are you" I said, at the rate of
Slow molasses from the state of
Vermont with a Southern drawl

Elvis, where are you when I need you most
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my Chantilly lace is catching
On the chandelier

He said he'd come to welcome, warn me
Just your diamond to adorn me
Come to be and see the one and only
For my final year
Well, thank you

Elvis, where are you when I need you most
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my Chantilly lace is catching
On the chandelier
It's catching on that chandelier
It's catching on that chandelier
Where are you when I need you most

"End Of The World"

Why does the sun go on shining
Why does the sea rush to shore
Don't they know it's the end of the world
Cause you don't love me any more

Why do the birds go on singing
Why do the stars glow above
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when I lost your love

I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything's the same as it was
I can't understand, no, I can't understand
How life goes on the way it does

Why does my heart go on beating
Why do these eyes of mine cry
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye

Why does my heart go on beating
Why do these eyes of mine cry
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye

"Every Man Gets His Wish"

You can whistle for it

Baby, you'll never grow old in my eyes
With your golden grill, true love never dies
You wanna watch me while I watch TV
While you're t-t-t-t-touching me
We're forever young in paradise
As long as you got the Chevrolet, I will ride

We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in that Chevrolet from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Every man deserves to see the sunrise

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine

You said I'd never make it out outta here alive
At the rate I was going, I'd be lucky to die
I was born so bad, not naturally right
The brightest star on Hollywood and Vine

We're gonna party like we're running outta time
We're getting drunk and driving fast on cherry wine
Never do belong to anyone I find
Leaving everything I ever knew behind

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
Promised me this
Well, you lied

I learned how to make love from the movies
He found me waitressing at Ruby Tuesday's
He said I wanna buy you a classic white milkshake
I said I'll serve you up a special side of heartbreak
Special side of heartbreak
I was working down in the corner cafe
You drove by in a Chevrolet
Whistle at me as my hips go sway
Lana Del Rey, how you get that way
How you get that way
I said, "He loves my heart shaped sunglasses
He loves the heart shape my ass is
Cristal, crystal champagne glasses."

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
Promised me this
Well, you lied

"Fake Diamond"

You're like a fake diamond
Sparkling when the lights are on
But when the nighttime comes
And all the lights go off
You turn off with them
(Where do you go when the lights turn low boy)
You're like an old film reel
Kissing me when the crowd can watch
But when the velvet falls
And the projector coughs
I can be sure you're gone
(You say it's not true but I know how you do, boy)

I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me

You're like a fake diamond
Sparkling in the moon and sun
You shine like the only one
But when the darkness comes
Baby, you're on the run
(Where do you go when the lights turn low boy)
You're like my ex-boyfriend
Kissing me when the camera's on
I'm candy for your arm
Look like a debutante
But I'm not what you want
(You say it's not true but I know how you do, boy)

I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me

I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me

Baby I can hold you tight
Let me love you right
In the middle of the night
I don't wanna fight
Give it to me
Sing it to me
Show me the light
(You say it's not true, but I know how you do, boy)

I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me
I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me

"Find My Own Way"

Snow is coming down like rain
I'm at it myself again
A little tired, even more confused
Come on, baby, don't be shy
You can say what make you high
I see the way you be lying, be abused

I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, don't you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
I don't care what you think

Breathing getting fast again
Now I'll start my worrying
When will I learn that there ain't nothing I can do

Jesus was a dying man
If he can't do it, no one can
When will you learn that we ain't nothing without you

We don't need anybody when we're down
We don't really find it hard to get around
We'll find our own way back to town
And oh, don't you tell us how we need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
We don't, we don't care what you think

I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, don't you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody but me
And I don't care what you think

"Fine China"

I wore diamonds for the birth of your baby
For the birth of your son
On the same day, my husband-to-be
Packed his things to run
Was bittersweet to say the least
One life begins, one comes undone
I've always been a strong woman of faith
Strong like a tree, but the unlucky one

I'm going down now
With all of my

Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they
They said that love was enough, but it wasn't
The Earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire, but we were wooden

I wore diamonds for the day of our wedding
For our day in the sun
On the same day, my mother-to-be said she wouldn't come
It's always been that way with me
No time for change, no time for fun
It's always been that way, it seems
One love begins, one comes undone

I'm going down now
With all of my

Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they
They said that love was enough, but it wasn't
The Earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire, but we were wooden

All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
Blue, ah, blue
All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
Blue, ah

Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they
They said that love was enough, but it wasn't
The Earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire, but we were wooden

Fine china, fine china, fine china
Fresh linen, fresh linen, fresh linen

"For You"

All these feelings I'm tired of them
Ruling over my life again
Emotions aren't my friend
I keep them ordered as best I can

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Layman, workman, his man, her man
How about about the weather

All these people I'm tired of them
Sifting into my life again
Their questions, the "how and when"
I try and answer the best that I can but

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Layman, workman, his man, her man
How about about the weather

All my worries, they come and go
They tend to leave when I let you know
On bad days I take it slow
I try to dance when I hit a low

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man
It will all get better

Oh, the days they go so fast
I can't believe what is in my past
The future's here at last
I don't need to have what she has

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man
It will all get better

Sing it out, sing it loud
Sing it out, sing it loud
Be proud, come out
Be proud, come out

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man
We can make it better, yeah
We will have it better

"Fordham Road"

30 blocks to Fordham Road
That's a bad neighborhood
Crack house on the corner
I know I shouldn't do what it is I could

The stone Mary in the garden
She let me know she watching
She said I better get walking
I better walk away

I don't know why it is that I wanna stay
I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way
But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say
I'm just gonna walk, I'm gonna walk away

I catch a dollar in the wind and I
Buy a cup of coffee
There's a place on Valentine
That still charge ninety cents
I keep on walking in the daytime
And in my eyes, it's always nighttime
And I like it when it's me at night
'Cause that's when all the stars come out
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh

I don't know why it is that I wanna stay
I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way
But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say
I'm just gonna walk, I'm gonna walk away

It's the greatest, it's the greatest day
It's the greatest, it's the greatest day, oh

I'm not gonna do what I hear me say
I'm just gonna walk, I'm gonna walk away

"Freak Like Me"
(Freak Demo)

Flames so hot that they turn blue
Palms reflecting in your eyes, like an endless summer
That's the way I feel for you
If time stood still, I'd take this moment, make it last forever

Your halo's full of fire
I'm rising up, rising up
My hot love's full of fire
Love's full of fire
La, ah

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

Leather black and eyes of blue
Sun reflecting in your eyes, like an easy rider
Life makes sense when I'm with you
Looking back, my past
It all seems stranger than a stranger

So let's dance in slow motion
Tear it up, tear it up
Let's dance by the ocean
Ah, ah

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

Marry me, marry me
Take a long vacation
Money and power and dresses, big standing ovation
Loving you can't be wrong
There's no complications, no

Marry me, marry me
Use all your relations
Carry me, carry me
Fuck our generation
Loving you can't be wrong
Love is our salvation now

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

I'm talking to him while I'm thinking of you
I'm trying my best, I don't know what to do

Talking to him, I don't know what it's about

"Golden Grill"

What happened to 'nobody does it better'
See ya walking 'round like you were born to kill
Driving in your Escalade flash that golden grill
You're picking up a bad habit you get the ones that no one will
Where did your love go babe before you turned criminal

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way

So here we are, there we go and that's the way
That you gonna roll, that you gonna fight, gonna play
It doesn't really matter to me that you find your way
You've been gone for so long that you're a shell of yourself babe

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way

The sun once shined for you
I've changed my mind for you
Your golden day has turned to night
Your golden day has been denied

There's no more chances for you now, you never learn
You lit my fire baby, but I just got burned

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happen to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way

"Greenwich"

Hey, back in, ah
Baby, come on

Are you back in Greenwich, dropping acid
Are you at the Archive, watching television
Did you leave for Battery with your weed
And your leather, looking like Ray Gillen
Are you still the king of rock 'n' roll, babe
Bet you miss hearing me sing, calling me Lana
And did you take your run today
Along that West Side Highway
Do you miss your baby mama
Blue hydrangea
Will my forever love never come back to me

Does it feel like yesterday to you, yet
How quickly you forget how I made you smile
I remember everything
The diamond horseshoe, wedding ring, and the tiara
Blue hydrangea
Will my forever love never return to me

"Hangin' Around"

You'll see me hanging around on the edges of town
I could be bad for you
And honey don't think about chasing this girl around
I could be bad for you

And anywhere you go, I will follow
Even if it's only in spirit, baby
But honey you should go by tomorrow
I predict that shit's gonna get real crazy

Leave while you still can
Before I take you down, take you down
Boy there's still a chance
For you to get out now, get out now

You'll see me hanging around on the edges of town
I could be bad for you
And honey don't think about chasing this girl around
I could be bad for you

And anywhere you go, I will follow
Even if it's only in spirit, baby
But honey you should go by tomorrow
I predict that shit's gonna get real crazy

Leave while you still can
Before I take you down, take you down
Boy there's still a chance
For you to get out now, get out now

"Hawaiian Tropic"

Hawaiian tropic, dark, and a bottle of jack in the Cadillac
As I drive down the highway
You aren't coming back and I know that now
So I let the wind hit me in my face

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish

Your red Hawaiian shirt and your hair jet black
Hanging 'round with your friends by the track
Baby, you can't come back from being that bad
Just to sit at home, pledge allegiance to the flag

Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone

Copacabana, yes in my party dress
I'm shimmering in love on that crystal meth
A Coca Cola kid, roller coaster child
You my everything, give me that baby doll smile

Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, where is mine
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, were you lying

And the velvet Elvis and the rosaries
And your white Corvette under willow trees
You the one for me, my one true king

Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone

I remember party dresses
I remember party dresses

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
But sometimes it comes too late

"Heavy Hitter"

I was lounging at the Chateau Marmont
Glimmering by the swimming pool
My man walked in like a slow-motion movie
I said, "You're so cool."

I heard a man screaming, "Lights, camera, action"
I c-c-can't remember what happened
I overdose, you throw me over your shoulder
I was dying, you were screaming
"Open up that Lamborghini."

Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Open up your butterfly doors
(What do you say)
Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Let's ch-ch-change our DNA
Let's change our DNA

You're the king mafia baby
I'm the Queen of Alchemy
I know a way to make gold
By mixing our souls to escape reality

Me and Monterrey went to that ocean
I got that magical trance potion
Gotta leave, I can't wait 'til I'm older
You was laughing, I was running
Use that remote to open up

Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Open up your butterfly doors
(What do you say)
Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Let's ch-ch-change our DNA
Let's change our DNA

You can be my higher power, baby
I can be your endless USA
We can go on drives for hours, baby
Let's cha-a-ange our DNA
Let's change our DNA
Let's change

Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Open up your butterfly doors
(What do you say)
Open up your butterfly doors
(Heavy hitter)
Let's ch-ch-change our DNA
Let's change our DNA

"Hey Blue Baby"

Hey blue baby
Put that Hank Williams on
It's your little blue baby
Calling for her favorite song
Get out that whiskey
Pour it right quickly
Put them hallway lights on
I hope one day you can remember
Our love before it all went wrong

But the only stars we saw were in the sky
Not the boulevard
And the only thing we wanted was to be free
And the only girl you had eyes for played downtown
At the local bar
That was me
She was me

Hey blue baby
Get that old pickup going
Turn it once, twice, three times
If you love me, oh
Get out that dirt bike
Get on that turnpike
Do what you have to do
Just know your baby's back here waiting
Just know she thinks you're really cool

And the only stars we saw were in the sky
Not the boulevard
And the only thing we need is to be free
And the only girl you have eyes for plays downtown
At the local bar
That was me
She was me

I tell you all the time, get yourself in line
Tired of waiting, tired of crying
I tell you all the time, get yourself in line
Tired of yelling, tired of hollering
You're making me blue, you're making me blue
Making me blue, just do what you do

And the only stars we need were in the sky
Not the boulevard
And the only thing we want is to be free
And the only girl that you love still
Plays downtown at the local bar
Yeah she's me
Yeah she's me

"Hey You"

Do, do
Ah, ah
I said

Hey you, what you doing
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
Hey you, what you doing
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me

He's a walk with the past
Love of the fast
Girls in the fast lane
His knuckles are brass
A heart like a horse
Love of the games, gold in his veins

Met him at the club
Singing my songs
He says, "Are you famous"
I was once
A b-movie actress
Has been, but never was
He knows that it's love

He saw me on stage
Pointed my way
The look of desire, all on his face
I gave him the eye
And took my place
I could tell that he'd be mine by daytime

Hey you, what you doing
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can't stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me

He's a man with a cast
Cane and a glass
Rim full of champagne, looking for class
A mind like a steel cage
Soul full of rage
Tactical nature so they call him insane

Met him at the club
And from that night on
He called me his princess, right on
I'm his little ex-beauty queen
Never going back to where I've been

Hey you, what you doing
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can't stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me

No one can save me
Oh, do, do, woah
When did I ever care
What they said about our love, my baby
My baby boo

Yo, our friends think it's sad
Living so bad
I'm always crying
He's always mad
Our life is a mess
Oh it's a shame
"What did they see in each other" they say

I met him at the club
And from that night on
Called me his princess, right on
I'm his little ex-beauty queen
Never going back to where I've been

Hey you, what you doing
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can't stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me
Hey you, what you doing
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can't stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me

No one can save me
No one can save me

"Hit And Run"

Hollywood and New York, mister major

Sitting in your lap for my interview

Let's hit it and run
Hit it and run the world

Baby, hit it and run
Hit it and run the world

Eyeing you from across the room
Watching me, wa-watching you

Hit it and run
Let's hit it and run
Hit it and run the world
Hit it and run

Nothing's for free
It's money and technology
Together we'd be deadly
You know this world is mean

"Hollywood"

One day, my hoops will be made of diamonds
My knuckles made of real gold
I'll spend my days getting high with all my friends
In the glamorous and green old part of Hollywood

Sun will rise, I'm a supernova
Body electric and I dance like Morrison
When the night begins, baby comes alive again

In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
I'm alive again
I'm alive again

One day, I'll drive in a gold Mercedes Benz
Singing opera on Bel Air Road
Hair to my ass will be flying in the wind
Shooting heroin and speedballs

See the sea, I'm a supernova
I walk on water and I dance like Joplin
When the sun descends, I dive into the waves again

In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
I'm alive again
I'm alive again

Oh-oh, oh-oh, c-can you see me
Whoa-oh, my heart beating fast
I can feel it chasing in the speed-lights
I was built to last
Whoa-oh, c-can you feel that
Ah-ah, ah-ah, my heart shaking fast
I can feel that you're the one for me
You'll be my first, and you'll be my last

In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
I'm alive again
I'm alive again

I'm alive again
I'm alive again

"Hollywood's Dead"

Our kind of love
It was once in a lifetime
It couldn't last
It was doomed from the first time
And you
Were '50s cool
In blue suede shoes
But it was a cover for all of the trouble
You got into

I always fall for the wrong guy
Things that are bad always taste nice
That's what girls like me do, lose you

Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Vicious in flames
Roland is dying
And in the light, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful

This kind of life
Wasn't meant for the good girl
Try as I might
In the end, it's a cruel world
And you
Are living proof
Sinatra aloof
But you were an actor who only went after
The ones who swooned

I always fall for the same type
Gangsters in Vegas on game night
That's what girls like me like, the limelight

Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Marilyn's sad
Hendrix is lying there
In the light, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful

If you should go before me, then know
That I always loved you
There's no one above you, babe

Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Lennon, wake up
Cobain, stop lying there
In the light, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodnight, you're so beautiful

Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead, yeah
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead, yeah

They're scared of your name
They know you're insane
I like it that way
I have to be your girl
I gotta be your girl

You're hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
You know that I want what you got
You shot, shot, shot, shot, shot
An arrow through my heart now I want you a lot

Life is like, like a little game
That we like to play
Just for fun, just for fun
'Cause we take nothing seriously
Nothings wrong, nothings wrong, oh
Life is like, like a piece of cake

Just for fun, in the sun
Yeah we know nothing means a thing cause

Jimmy pulls up in his blue Chevy Nova
I have been dying for him to come over
I'm in my party dress, he say "You such a mess"
I am the New Jersey Dance Queen
He is the gangster action king
He knows that I be selling the body
My man the best 'cause he knows what's up

He knows it's a big bad world, knows that I'm a good girl
He understands the sale of self

J is a romantic roller-coaster
He don't do anything he supposed to

I am the trailer park darling, he is the one-time come-back king
He knows that I be looking to die
He says, baby, pay respect to the high

He knows it's a big bad world, knows that I'm a good girl
He understands the sale of self
Cause cash comes quick when looks can kill

Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill

"I Can Fly"
(from "Big Eyes" soundtrack)

I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

I had bright wishes in the summer, I was bathing in sunlight
Painting in the garden like a ghost in mid-July
Running fast from something with my eyes wide like
Saucers spinning in the sun

I had a dream that I was fine
I wasn't crazy, I was divine

I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

Your lies were hot kisses in the summer
I was dreaming of a lake
Dreaming of the water where I'd rise like a phoenix
Or an iron from the fire
I've got things to tell you like I know that you're a liar

I had a dream that I was fine
I wasn't crazy, I was divine

I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

Your words cut like a knife in butter
I was fighting for my art
Fighting with my lover, you had me so tied up
Thinking there's no other
Yeah, right
Yeah, right

I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

"I Don't Wanna Go"

He don't like no small things
Even riding 'round on tall dreams
I don't wanna go
He's a sweet baby, but he looks mean
In his soft leather and his blue jeans

He got a way, oh, baby, he got a way, oh, baby
He got a way with his words
They be like diamonds and pearls
They be like diamonds and pearls
He gives to his little favorite girls

I don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

He don't like no spotlight
Stands real quiet in the moonlight

He got a way, oh, baby, he got a way, mm, baby
He got a way with those words
They be like diamonds and pearls
They be like diamonds and pearls
He gives to his little favorite girls

I don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

Loving you isn't right
Black leather moonlight (I give in)
Loving you isn't right
It's original sin

I don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

I feel like I can do anything
Like I can do anything
Like I can do anything that I like
I feel like I can do anything
Like I can do anything
Like I can do anything
Tonight
Baby, tonight
Tonight

"I Must Be Stupid For Being So Happy"

Well I must be stupid for feeling so happy
I must be crazy for calling you mine
My life's like a movie but I just let it move me
So slow like a two-step, you hold me real tight

All my friends say my lifes
Like a bad country song
I just smile, say "I know, but I like to sing along"
For the sweet wedding days
I just put Hank Williams on
I must be stupid for feeling so happy
But they can call me what they want

They think I'm crazy but I keep laughing
They think I'm funny for wearing a smile
But its just in my nature and it's just how you move me
Real slow like a movie and I wanna rewind

All my friends say my life's
Like a bad country song
I just smile, say "I know, but I like to sing along"
For the sweet wedding days
I just put Hank Williams on
I must be stupid for feeling so happy
But they can call me what they want

Ah, la, la
Ah, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
I must be stupid for feeling so happy
But they can call me what they want

"I Still Love Him"

And I remember when I met him, it was so clear that
He was the only one for me
We both knew it, right away
And as the years went on, things got more difficult -
We were faced with more challenges
I begged him to stay
Try to remember what we had at the beginning

He was charismatic, magnetic, electric and everybody knew it
When he walked in every woman's head turned, everyone stood up to talk to him
He was like this hybrid, this mix of a man who couldn't contain himself
I always got the sense that he became torn between being a good person and missing out on all of the opportunities that life could offer a man as magnificent as him

And in that way I understood him
And I loved him
I loved him, I loved him, I loved him
And I still love him
I love him

"I Talk To Jesus"

One, two
One, two

I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
What the fuck happened here
I guess what they meant when
They paid the price
I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
Where are the trailer parks
And where all the Christmas lights

I had a boyfriend
He came from this town
We used to pretend we were married and start again
He read the Bible
Showed me what Jesus said
He said I should rewrite (He only read the red)

I want Jesus to take me out this life, baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
Nothing looks familiar here
No one even that I like
I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
I was so much happier when I was gonna be your wife

We had a deal and
I fucked it up when
I made the decision to become someone
We had the one thing that no one ever had
True love
It's true love

I ask Jesus to take me out this life baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

I never meant to hurt you baby
It's so hard to be true
In this world where everything's so black and blue
I never meant to hurt you darling
It's so hard to be good
In this world where you do what you know you shouldn't

I want Jesus to take me out this life baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

"I Want It All"

Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address

I'm the national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on", he said "Yes, yes, yes..."
(Of course we can, my darling)

And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on the stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact kiss, kiss

I sing the national anthem
While I'm standing over your body, hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron
He says to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real
Don't you know who you're dealing with
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds
(Yes, of course I will my darling)

And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on the stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs, and our love, and our dreams, and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well
I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel

Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

I'm the national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of sweetness and danger
Queen of Saigon
He says to be cool and I know he means it
He's loving my look
And I'm loving all his strategic ways
I said "do you think you'll kill for me one day"
(Yes, of course I will, my darling)

And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on his stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
I'm your national anthem, national anthem
I'm your national anthem, national anthem

"I Was In A Bad Way"

Wait, wait, for me
Wait, wait, wait, for me
Come on, baby

I was in a bad way, honey
'Til I met you
I was in a bad place, honey
I need you

I was going nowhere fast, you were bringing me down
I wanted to go, you were the cutest guy in town

Wait, wait, wait, for me
I don't wanna go
Wait for me
I wanna go, I wanna go
Wait for me
I wanna go

I was in a bad way, honey
I was in a bad way, I was in a bad way

Bring it on punk, you know that I want it
I'm not a bad girl but when I go to clubs, I want to flaunt it
I feel like, you're Superman, and I'm not
It's on your terms, we can waste all my time
Because I want you, I want to go with you
Don't leave me here, I want to go with you

Can I be your baby doll, my my
Can I be your cherry pie
Why do all the best girls like bad guys
Cause they're to die for

I know what they say about you, you know that I never care
You were always my type with your dark heart and your long, black hair, yeah
Baby, I wanna take you higher, higher
So let me, so let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me love you
Let me love you, let me love you

I don't wanna go
Take me with you
I don't wanna go away, no
Take me with you

I need you, I want you, you know that

"If I Die Young"
(AKA "On & On & On")

All the roses are red and Jupiter, too
I'm lying in my nightgown making confessions to you
It's all over now, baby blue
All my secrets are out
I told them all to you

And it's a little grim
But I sing a hymn only for you
I seal it with a kiss
And it goes like this
"Baby, love me too"

If I die young, let me die in California
And when I'm gone, let 'em play my favorite song
It's Jimmy Buffet
To remember life's a beach, baby, enjoy it
When I'm done, let the music play on
And on and on and on
Go on and on and on

All my stories are out
All the lies are out, too
When we drive in the nighttime
I lift them up to you

And it's a little grim
But I sing a hymn only for you
I seal it with a kiss
And it goes like this
"Baby, love me, too"

If I die young, let me die in California
And when I'm gone, make 'em play my favorite song
It's Jimmy Buffet
To remember life's a beach, baby, enjoy it
When I'm done, let the music play on
And on and on and on
Go on and on and on

Be my baby (Ohh)
Be my baby, tonight
We'll go on and on and on
Be my baby (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Be my baby, tonight
Go on and on and on

It's a little grim
But I sing a hymn only for you
I seal it with a kiss
And it goes like this

We'll go on and on and on
Be my baby (Mmm)
Be my baby, tonight
Go on and on and on

"In The Sun"

Everybody said that it wasn't love
I was dumb
I was getting high on your sugar rush
For too long
You told me that we could have it all
Now you're posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, what the hell
We were in heaven then we fell
I believed you, said I'd never leave you
I-

I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Living with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now you're posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, having fun, having fun

Everybody said, "Careful of that guy"
Baby couldn't stop, it was suicide
Headed for a cliff, eyes open wide
You were feigning love by holding tight
But I need you, don't want to, but need to
I-

I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Living with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now you're posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, having fun, having fun

You been messing around with my beating heart
You should be ashamed
Boy, you never loved me from the start
Such a wicked game
I told you I needed somebody
I never used you for love or for money, boy
I feel like I can't trust nobody
Beat on my heart and you left it all bloody, now

I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Living with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now you're posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, having fun, having fun

"In Wendy"

Well, dark clouds they'll subside for awhile
And sit down, I can make my friends smile
I have lost a lot but I'm sane, you know
And I'm calling you up just to say hello, so
Hi, my lovely, hi, my lovely
I am someone else

I did think I would live life alone
I was sure I was made out of stone
I have lost a lot but you helped me find
What was really real and some peace of mind
And I'm awfully thankful and I am so grateful
I need no one else

Will you think of me when I am gone
Will you comfort me when I am wrong
I have a lost a lot but I'm feeling fine 'cause I
Finally found out nothing's mine and I'm
Only human, I'm so human
I am nothing else

"Is It Wrong"

I guess it's symptomatic of a slight infatuation
Stalking you has sorta become like my occupation
Used to be a beauty queen with simple acquisitions
Met my local rock star now I'm having visions

I fell for you, you like me too
Let's get it on, check one, two
I fell for you, you want me too
Let's get it on

Is it wrong
Is it wrong
I'm making out with you while you're singing your song
Is it wrong
Is it wrong
You're playing your guitar and it's turning me on
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walking around like you don't care
You got me in the back of your car like a star
Is it wrong
Is it wrong
If it's wrong, I don't wanna be right

I get so systematic in this kind of situation
I need it, have to have it, t-take over, domination
Used to be so simple, never wanting, never wishing
Now I'm hooked on fame and I'm a girl on a mission

I fall for you, it's all for you
Let's get it on, check one, two
I fall for you, it's all for you
Let's get it on

Is it wrong
Is it wrong
I'm making out with you while you're singing your song
Is it wrong
Is it wrong
You're playing your guitar and it's turning me on
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walking around like you don't care
You got me in the back of your car like a star
Is it wrong
Is it wrong
If it's wrong, I don't wanna be right

A funny little thing about love is that you're blind all the time
And even when you think you had enough
You're wanting more, it isn't right but
You can't stop

You got your eyeliner, long hair, walking around like you don't care
You got me in the back of your ca-ca-ca-car-r-r
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walking around like you don't care
You got me in the back of your ca-ca-ca-car-r-r
Is it wrong
Is it wrong
If it's wrong I don't wanna be right

"Jesus Is My Boyfriend"

He's Jesus Christ
And I'm his babydoll
I'm his favourite human but he saved them all

He's my personal saviour
He's my personal saviour

Jesus is my boyfriend
Jesus is my boyfriend
Jesus is my boyfriend
Jesus is my boyfriend

He's my personal saviour
He's my personal angel
My God thinks I'm smashing
He thinks I'm fine
My God takes me dashing cross the party line

He's my personal saviour
He's my personal saviour
My God treats me special
Gives me lots of things
I had some of his boyfriends offer diamond rings

He's my personal saviour
He's my personal saviour

He's my personal angel
He's my cherry pie
Said to call him "Dick Chasey"
He's my private eye
When I get in my gown
He comes to me in the night

"JFK"

You smell like a million roses
Bathed in rock 'n' roll
Ours was the greatest
Love story ever told
Throat like an angel with a voice that was made of gold
That's my baby

He was the king of the town
With a crown that would never fall
A heart that would beat
Like a bass for his baby doll
One in a million, inimitable soul
That's my baby

Young or old, summer or cold
Young or old, summer or cold

You've got a way
Like JFK when you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart, and it drives me crazy

He was the king of the town
With a crown that would never fall
A heart like a bass that would beat for his baby doll
Mind like a diamond
An un-imitable song
That's my baby

Young or old, summer or cold
Young or old, summer or cold

You've got a way
Like JFK when you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart, and it drives me crazy
It drives me crazy

You've got it
And I want it
Late summer nights in July, flaunt it
You know that you can always come home
To the one who gave you your name
'Cause I see a light in your eyes
It's so bright, and
The skies, they open wide for you
So come to me, my baby

You've got a way
Like JFK when you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart, and it drives me crazy

It drives me crazy
It drives me crazy
Crazy, oh, oh-oh

"Kinda Outta Luck"

I was born bad, but then I met you
You made me nice for a while
But my dark side's true
You never cared what I did at all
Motel singer or the silver pole
I did what I had to do

Femme fatale, always on the run
Diamonds on my wrist
Whiskey on my tongue
Before I get bad, I gotta get drunk
So get over here
Pour me a cold one

Babe, you can see that I'm danger
Teetering off of the stage, yeah
Sparkling in sequins, say, hey-yeah
Time to give in to the kindness of strangers

Is it wrong Mom that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck
Is it wrong Mom that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck

Wrong, I know, killing someone
It gets a little easier when you've done it once
You know that I'm fun, you know that I'm young
So tell me you're mine
Let's get it on

Babe, you can see that I'm dangerous
Glamorous, but I'm deranged, yeah
Teetering off of the stage, yeah
I said it really nicely, so can you be my savior

Is it wrong Mom that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck
Is it wrong Mom that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck

I was a dangerous girl
You were too nice for this world
And now I'm back on the prowl
Who wants to give it a whirl

Is it wrong Mom that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck

When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck

"Lake Placid"

He don't like no spotlight
He the kinda man, stand real quiet
He don't wanna go, go home
He don't wanna go, go home

He's a sweet baby, but he looks mean
In his soft leather, and his blue jeans
He don't wanna go, go
He don't wanna go, go, go

You are just an American boy, you got your youth and you got your dreams
You ride your Harley like there's nothing to lose, you got the wind, but you're not free

And you don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
We don't wanna go, go home
Baby tonight
Baby tonight

He don't like no small things
He be riding round on some tall dreams
He don't wanna go, go home
He don't wanna go, go home

Hollywood sun, small town things
Probably he's changed, that's why he drinks
He don't wanna go, go home
He don't wanna go, go home

He was just an American kid, liked rock and roll and wanted to have fun
He felt the same way all of us did like probably he was the only one

And you don't wanna go, go home
I won't wanna go, go home
We won't wanna go, go home
Baby tonight
Baby tonight

I was just an American girl, I was reaching for the sun
I never really had big dreams when I saw you, were my only one
And I don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
Baby tonight
Baby tonight
Baby tonight
Baby tonight

"Last Girl On Earth"

Baby has a broken heart
She can't belong to only one
Until another girl is found
I don't pay for anything
My cigarettes or diamonds rings
My feet don't even touch the ground

Chariots of gold, I ride with Jay-, Jared Leto
I'm a superpower, now they call me the tornado
I got roses in my hair, I belly dance, and do the tango
Sometimes I get lonely, everybody told me no

No one lives forever, but that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on

Cleopatra used to rule
But she got nothing on me now
'Cause I'm the last girl on earth
I turn the television on
They only play my favorite song
Since I'm the last girl on Earth

Chariots of gold, I'm sitting, sipping cherry cola
Caesar said he'd fall in love with me if I was older
I own all of Mexico and I got my own roller-coaster
Sometimes I get lonely, millions can hold me now

No one lives forever, but that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on

I stay up late at night, try not to think about it
Pretend I'm happy, ruling all the world without love
I get so tired being on display somehow
Sometimes I get lonely, but millions all know me now

No one lives forever, but that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love
There's no such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on

"Let My Hair Down"

You make me wanna let my hair down, man
You make me wanna let my hair down
You make me wanna let my hair down, man

You got me dancing up the stairs now
You got me dancing up the stairs now, man
You got me dancing up the stairs now

"Life Is Beautiful"

Don't be that way
Don't you pretend
You're not awake
When you know you are
I see the way
You're lying there
I know you can't
Be very far

God wouldn't do that
He knows how I feel
I can't go through that
And so it's not real

Life is still so beautiful
Life is still so beautiful

Don't be so still
You never are
You like to play
Your soul's on fire
I don't believe this is the end
And I still feel your heart's desire

God couldn't do that
He knows you belong
To me and me only
And so I'll be strong

Life is still so beautiful
Life is still so beautiful

Come on, boy, let's go
We can hit the road
We don't have to say
Where we're going
We can go anywhere
We can go anywhere
We can go anywhere
Right now

Life is still so beautiful
Life is still so beautiful

"Lift Your Eyes"

You should have let me know
That I had no chance at all
I can never be what you wanted
Should have let me know
That you're still thinking about her
Should've told me you was on it

Sometimes I wonder why
Why I even bother
Trying to pull you out, boy
Should have let me know
I would lose you to the drink

Lift your eyes, lift your eyes
Just a little higher, just a little higher
Lift those eyes, look into mine
Cause I can guide ya, I can guide ya
Lift those eyes, lift your eyes
I know that you're scared to death
Running out of breath
But I can hold you, hold you

You should have let me know
That you worked around the clock
Could have tried a little harder, yeah
You should have let me know
That you were afraid to love me
Afraid of looking like a liar

Sometimes I wonder why
Why I even ask you, but I do

Lift your eyes, lift your eyes
Just a little higher, just a little higher
Lift those eyes, look into mine
Cause I can guide you, I can guide you
Lift those eyes, lift your eyes
I know that you're scared to death
Running out of breath
But I can hold you, hold you

"Looking For America"

Took a trip to San Francisco
All our friends said we would jive
Didn't work, so I left for Fresno
It was quite a scenic drive
Pulled over to watch the children in the park
We used to only worry for them after dark

I'm still looking for my own version of America
One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly
No bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind

I flew back to New York City
Missed that Hudson River line
Took a train up to Lake Placid
That's another place and time, where
I used to go to drive-ins and listen to the blues
So many things that I think twice about before I do now

I'm still looking for my own version of America
One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly
No bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind

It's just a dream I had in mind

"Lust For Life (BloodPop Remix)"
(feat. The Weeknd)

There's nobody here, just us together
Keeping it hot like July forever

'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
There's no way for us to come, wait
'Cause boy we're gold, boy we're gold
And I was like

Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all of your clothes

They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight, yeah

And a lust for life (and a lust for life)
And a lust for life (and a lust for life)
Keeps us alive (keeps us alive)
Keeps us alive (keeps us alive)
And a lust for life (and a lust for life)
And a lust for life (and a lust for life)
Keeps us alive (keeps us alive)
Keeps us alive (keeps us alive)

'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
So there's no need for us to hesitate
We're all alone, let's take control
And I was like

Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all of your clothes

They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight, yeah

And a lust for life
And a lust for life

We dance on the H of the Hollywood sign
'Til we run out of breath, gotta dance 'til we die
My boyfriend's back and he's cooler than ever
There's no more night, blue skies forever

And a lust for life (and a lust for life)
And a lust for life (and a lust for life)
Keeps us alive (keeps us alive)

"Lust For Life (Demo 3)"

One foot in the door
I've been trying
To get your attention
Is it working out yet
Love me or love me not
I don't care anymore
But baby, I've been dying
To get your attention
And I was like

Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes

That just ain't us
Plus you're having too much fun
You're not in a rush

But it's funny how some things just change in a day, or even in an hour
I'm like a wild caged animal, lying by the swimming pool, losing all my power
It's funny how my life just stopped and shifted from meeting you as a stranger
Now I'm like a wild caged animal, lying by the swimming pool, trying to avoid danger

But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive

Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes

They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight

But it's funny how some things just change in a day, or even in an hour
Now I'm like a wild caged animal, sitting by the swimming pool, losing all my power
It's funny how life can change or be shaped passing by a stranger
Now I'm like a wild caged animal, lying by the swimming pool, trying to avoid danger

But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive

It's funny how some things just change in a day, or even in an hour
I'm like a wild caged animal, sitting by the swimming pool, losing all my power
It's funny how life can change or be shaped passing by a stranger
Now I'm like a wild caged animal, lying by the swimming pool, trying to avoid danger

But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive

"Madly"

I was off the coast of Havana Maria
Broke like I always wanted
You were hopped up, getting drunk on sangria
Drunk like you always wanted
Couple crazy kids but by the physical
I think you're crazy, bitch, but purely musical

Swim across my blue lake
Come into my boathouse
Eat my birthday cake
Take all your clothes off

I don't want your cherry
I just want you very badly
I don't wanna marry you, just wanna be your darling
I don't wanna fall in love, just wanna make you happy
Let me love you more, more, more
La, la, la love you madly

We can go down, pray to Santa Maria
Fuck what I've wanted and followed
Somewhere far on the road near Virginia
Life like I always wanted
Feel like I first did
We're fucked on the physical
It's just the way life is
I don't know what I want

Swim across my blue lake
Come into my boathouse
Eat my birthday cake
Take all your clothes off

I don't want your cherry
I just want you very badly
I don't wanna marry you, just wanna be your darling
I don't wanna fall in love, just wanna make you happy

Love you madly

"Maha Maha"

Every time that you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I can't see
He's someone I have never talked about
'Cause I know that we'd both be dead if you found out

Every time you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something I have been withholding
I'm not like every other girl

Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for

So if you begin to think
That my light might be supernatural
I'd have to say "You're right, you're right, mon cher, it is"
I come from a place that your mind cannot even imagine
Where we sing "Maha, maha, maha, maha"

Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for

Maha, oh Maha
Oh Maha, Maha
I give my loving, I'm your devoted
I'll give my love, babe
I'm your devoted

Maha, Maha, Maha, Maha
Maha, Maha, Maha

"Making Out"

Hiya honey
What ya doing
I been hula-hooping waiting for you, aah
Whoa haters, fakers, mass-manipulators
Don't know what you're trying to prove
I'm the New York City queen queen
You should hear me sing sing
Baby I'm the real thing, check one two
Stop looking at my train-wreck life and start
Listening to the way I sing the blues

You know, I know what they say about me
I know that they think I'm danger
So what if it makes me happy, happy, happy

It doesn't really matter what you say
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Baby you can't stop me, stop me, now
When I'm hot, I'm hot

"Hiya honey
How's it going
Saw you skipping up on TV looking blue aah
You're shaking, making music and you're famous
Deep down you're the same girl I knew"

She said, I know what they say about you
I know that they think you're crazy
I know that they are mistaken, baby, baby

It doesn't really matter what they say
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Baby you can't stop me, stop me, now
When I'm hot, I'm hot

Singing for the gangsters
Chasing all that paper
Living life so dangerously
And there's nothing for my anger
Money is my savior
I can be whatever I think
It's like heaven, heaven
Living on the edge never knowing where I'm going to be
And I am dreading, never settling down
That's when dying is beginning to please

It doesn't really matter what you say
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Honey you can't stop me, stop me, now
When I'm hot, I'm hot

"Match Made In Heaven"

If they're gonna talk, let 'em

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of

What I'll never do, I really fell for you
You give me butterflies, heart skipping one, two

I, I, I, gotta get it started
I want it bad, bad, I want it bad

I know you're sick, boy, I wanna get the flu
I'm running temperatures thinking of your love, boo
Dizzy spells, ooh, is your love true
I'm under influence, getting hot and chills too

I, I, I, gotta get it started
I want it bad, bad, I want it bad

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

Sweet neighborhood

And so has every other girl, that's why they want you
My local rock star, the Willie B. crew
You out there on the grind
Now come home to your queen, boo

I, I, I, gotta get it started
I want it bad, bad, I want it bad

You're number one, boy, no one else will do
I'm like a prize fighter, clocking chicks to get to you
This race I run for you, won't stop until I'm through
I'm out there doing shit that I should never ever do

I, I, I, gotta get it started
I want it bad, bad, I want it bad

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

Down on your knees, begging me, please
I am your queen, oh-ah

Don't wanna trip but I could fall for you
Heaven is a place called earth on your arm, ooh

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

"Meet Me In The Pale Moonlight"

Understand this, I'm not looking for true love tonight
If you wanna be my little baby
You can meet me in the pale moonlight
I been working every day 8 to 9 and
Serving coke and fries at the movie blue drive-in
If you want me, you know where to find me

I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby

Understand this, I been liking you since I was small
I don't wanna get you running scared
When there's no pressure there at all
I been working 8 to 9 every day
And think about you almost all the time, all the time and
If I wanna see you, I drive by

I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby

I'm the sweetest girl in town so why are you so mean
When you gonna ditch that stupid .... you got
It's me you should be seeing

Hello-o-o you are looking so fine, so fine
Fantasy about you's like a gold mine, gold mine
Asking everybody, "Is he mine Is he mine"
Not quite yet, but I'm gonna get-get him
Not quite yet, but I'm gonna get-get him

I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby

"Melancholia"

If it was the New York Times, they'll say that I'm dead
And if it's Rolling Stone, they'll say I'm uninviting
I don't really give a fuck, it's no surprise
I never had friends here either
Still I'm on a run with the light in my eyes
And if you did it wouldn't happen either

Sometimes bad things happen to good people
And sometimes angels touch pure evil
That don't mean they stop
They can fight for what's right and I will
'Cause I don't have the time to kill
And I, I don't have the will

If you see the light in my eyes, know I'm shining
I walk my road alone 'til here, so I'll keep writing
I don't need your love, I've been this far down
Back into the New York City
I've been sober for eleven years right now
If that don't mean a thing, well, I try

Sometimes bad things happen to good people
And sometimes angels touch pure evil
And I won't stop, I won't fight
I'll just stray towards the light
'Cause I know sometimes bad things happen to good people
And that's mine

Jesus, walk with me
I don't have anything I can offer up to you
But Jesus can comfort me
I don't really wanna drink, some pot will do
Heaven is on Earth
I have peace and that's more than you
I can live in the light like a maniac
In the stars attack, in the zodiac

So ride for the first time and die for the last time
I'm with the angels and I'm stressed in the back row
Keeping me harder, I try and I start
But I'm scared I won't catch up and it don't matter

Sometimes bad things happen to good people
And sometimes angels touch pure evil
And I will fight for the right
To keep on making art out of my life
Fight for the right to be different
In a world full of fake bitches

"Methamphetamines"

Methamphetamines, pink flamingo
Blue 50's queen, blue oyster cove
For the big dream, why don't we go
To Coney Island
When the hour numb the guy lies on
The record spins blue '50s song
The veranda looks ocean now
Neon palms sway
What's happening Where did we go
The Jersey Shore was long ago
As with our hopes and ocean grove
And so I bid you farewell

"More Mountains"

I top every mountain there's a hurdle in the sky
When at last you've found them you will understand as I
There is no solution
Life is without resolution

You must ask yourself what you really want in life
You must trust in me when I tell you it's alright
It's alright tonight
It's alright tonight

I remember New Year's that your everything seemed right
We had not made plans and we just drove all the whole night
Let's all go find a friend
Don't stop until the end

You must ask yourself, am I really the one
You can't be of help if you can't have any fun
I'm your one if you want me to be
Please leave me be
Who are you to say a soul won't live forever
Yeah, yeah

Atop every mountain there's a hurdle in the sky
When at last you've found them you will understand as I
Each breath is sent from angels
These people, they are not strangers

You must ask yourself what you really want in life
You must trust in me when I tell you it's alright
It's alright tonight
It's alright tonight

Even my best days without you
Were nothing in comparison to my worst days
Once I had found you
Once I had you
I had everything

When I was sleeping without you
Haunted by the baddest dreams
I asked you beside me
I have you, yes I have you
Smiling in your sleep
You would talk to me, in my wildest dreams
I never knew I'd find somebody like you
Like you
Like like
I'd find somebody like you
Like you
Like you

When I was sleeping without you
Haunted by the baddest dreams
At last you're beside me
I have you, yes I have you
Smiling in your sleep
Pillow talk to me
In my wildest dreams
I never knew I find somebody like you
Like you
Like like
I find somebody like you
Like you
Like you

"National Anthem (Music-Video Version)"

Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday, Mr. President
Happy Birthday to you
Thanks, Mr. President
For all the things you've done
The battles that you've won
The way you deal with US Steel and our problems by the ton
We thank you so much
Everybody

Money is the anthem
Of success
So before we go out
What's your address

I'm your National Anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons
Bugatti Veyron

He loves to romance them
Reckless abandon
Holdin' me for ransom
Upper echelon

He says to "be cool" but
I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on"
He said, "Yes, yes, yes"

Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Booyah, baby, bow down
Making me say wow now
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Sugar, sugar, how now
Take your body downtown
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and
Baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your National Anthem

Money is the reason
We exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact
Kiss, kiss

I sing the National Anthem
While I'm standing over your body
Hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me
Or your pants on
See what you've done to me
King of Chevron

He said to "be cool" but
I'm already coolest
I said to get real",
Don't you know who you're dealing with
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds

Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Booyah baby, bow down
Making me say wow now
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Sugar, sugar, how now
Take your body downtown
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and
Baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your National Anthem

It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick sick rampage
Wining and dining
Drinking and driving
Excessive buying
Overdose and dyin'
On our drugs and our love
And our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely
I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well
I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his bell tower, hotel

Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara, and your party dress

I'm your National Anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of
Sweetness and Danger
Queen of Saigon

Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Booyah, baby, bow down
Making me say wow now
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Sugar, sugar, how now
Take your body down town
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and
Baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your National Anthem

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success

And I remember when I met him.
It was so clear that he was the only one for me.
We both knew right away.
And as the years went on things got more difficult,
We were faced with more challenges.
I begged him to stay,
Tried to remember what we had in the beginning.
He was charismatic, magnetic, electric, and everybody knew him
When he walked in every woman's head turned.
Everyone stood up to talk to him.
He was like this hybrid, this mix of a man who couldn't contain himself.
I always got the sense that he became torn between being a good person and missing out on all of the opportunities that life could offer a man as magnificent as him.
And in that way, I understood him.
And I loved him, I loved him, I loved him, I loved him.
And I still love him, I love him.

"Never Let Me Go"

Hold me in your arms
Love me like your best friends did
Promise I won't hurt you, kid
Hold me really tight until the stars look big
Never let me go

All the world is ours
Like they say in Scarface, kid
You can push your drugs and I can make it big
Singing at CBGB's, have a real good gig
Hey, you never know

'Cause, baby, we were born to live fast and die young
Born to be bad, have fun
Honey, you and me can be one
Just believe, come on

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Boy, we're in a world war, let's go all the way
Put your foot to the floor, really walk my way
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay

L.A.'s gonna look real good
Drive me in your car until the sky gets big
Never let me go

Send me to the stars
Tell me when I get there, kid

Get into some trouble like our parents did

I remember when I saw you for the first time
You were laughing, sparkling like a new dime
I came over, "Hello, can you be mine
Can you be mine Can you be mine"

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Baby, it's a sweet life, sing it like a song
It's a short trip, only getting one
Can count on you, my love, more than anyone
Never let me go

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Boy, we're in a world war, let's go all the way
Put your foot to the floor, really walk my way
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay

Walking is an art, so is my body

I'm Miss Parlor-Tricks, sips of the Bacardi
I can make you dope, sick from the naughtiness
He says, "Who the best" You is

I'm glamorous, famous
Notorious, dangerous, "But you're crazy"
"I'm gonna leave you,"
He said, "You're not a real girl
You're like a cartoon

Yo, good luck, good luck, good luck
May all the stars in the sky
Bow down to you, we're through."

You gotta be smart and I'm a little smarty

Party favor favorite of them all
He says "Baby doll is so sick"
Sick off your naughtiness-ness-ness-ness-ness

Let's go to Vegas
He say "Who the best"
He said "She is, she is but, yo

And she's full of rage like me
And I like the game, yo"

Cause I'm glamorous I'm famous
Notorious dangerous but I'm crazy, yo
Glamorous dangerous
Notorious but famous but I'm crazy

"On Our Way"

You, you light my red fire babe
Hot white, and blue
And I, I think that you

Loving everything you do

You say we're gonna run away
Put on your sundress, summer day
Flying around on the highway

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and every day
Top down, gonna make a getaway, top down
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
You found me when I had lost my way
Foot down, we're going all the way, touchdown
Gonna make a getaway, top down

You know what I want
Take me to the K-Mart, pick me up pink lip gloss
How you get so hot
You're making me crazy
Hoping you'll never stop

You say that we were meant to be
We'll be together finally
Flying around and I'm finally free

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and every day
Top down, gonna make a getaway, top down
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
You found me when I had lost my way
Foot down, we're going all the way, touchdown
Gonna make a getaway, top down

We're on our way
We're on our way
We're on our way
We're on our way

Why do I think too much
You tell me not to worry
Because you're the boss
And you, you got a real good plan
My trouble's all over now
Because you're my man

You don't know what you've done to me
You're heavier than heavenly
Life on the run has set me free, me free now

We're on our way

You tell me not to worry
Because you're the boss

"Once Upon A Dream"
(from "Maleficent" soundtrack)

I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you, that look in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem

But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-aah mmh
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-aah mmh, mmh-mmh, mmh-mmh

But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream

I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you, that gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem

But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream

"Ooh Baby"

"Paris"

Baby, say goodnight
Text me when you get home safely
Like you always did when we was first dating

You're sitting in your office, dreaming of a different life
You say you wanna make me smile and see my wild side
If we don't leave town now
We're never gonna get out of here alive
I'm walking home from school
My thoughts are drifting into space
Why don't we leave tonight
And take off to a different place
Don't tell my daddy why
Gotta get on that plane and just fly

Take me to Paris
Let's go there and never look back
Paris (ooh), we can be crazy like that
You're such a naughty boy
Why you taking that Polaroid
Put on a show you'll enjoy
Take me to Paris
(Ooh, la-la, ooh, la-la)
(Ooh, la-la, ooh, la-la)

I wanna be that fantasy that you got on your mind
Flying across the sea to somewhere that they'll never find
We should go while we're young
'Cause one day, we will want to rewind

To our time in Paris
Take me to Yves Saint Laurent
Paris (ooh), make out in a dark restaurant
We'll dance until we die
Why not go out every night
Promise we won't say goodbye

Take me to Paris
Let's go there and never look back
Paris (ooh), we can be crazy like that
You're such a naughty boy
Why you taking that Polaroid
Put on a show you'll enjoy
Take me to Paris
(Ooh, la-la, ooh, la-la)
(Ooh, la-la, ooh, la-la)

Walking through the streets at dawn
We dance by empty carousels
Singing at the Sacr-Cur
And climbing up the Tour Eiffel
Under the stars, we are, we are
Dreaming (of Paris)

You're such a naughty boy
Why you taking that Polaroid
Put on a show you'll enjoy

Take me to Paris (ooh)
Take me to Yves Saint Laurent
It's Paris (ooh), make out in a dark restaurant
We'll dance until we die
Why not go out every night
Promise we won't say goodbye
Take me to Paris
(Ooh, la-la, ooh, la-la)
(Ooh, la-la, ooh, la-la)

Baby, say goodnight
Text me when you get home safely
Like you always did when we was first dating

"Party Girl (St. Tropez)"

Standing on the rooftop
Just out of earshot
Looking at this gangster guy

Thinking he's a hot shot
Pouring me a big shot
Trying to get me drunk and high

He wishes to be seen with me in his limousine
And he says, "We'll have a real good time"
Well, O, but I want you to know

Every single night, in the lights I'll be sparkling bright
I'm just a party girl, trying to get my drinks for free from you
If you hold me tight, it's alright, let the fire ignite
I'm a party girl, and I'm just warning you

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
Came tonight to put my work on display
Bringing New York down to St. Tropez

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
I won't fall in love, I won't ever stop
I'm partying all night, I'm gonna make it pop

Kissing on your white yacht
Show me what you got got
Play a little rock n' roll
On an island hop stop, maybe we should dot dot dot
(Lose control)

Do you think it's really mean that I'm only on the scene
'Cause I want a little danger boy
Well, O, but I told you so

Every single night, in the lights I'll be sparkling bright
I'm just a party girl, trying to get my drinks for free from you
If you hold me tight, it's alright, let the fire ignite
I'm a party girl, and I'm just warning you

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
Came tonight to put my work on display
Bringing New York down to St. Tropez

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
I won't fall in love, I won't ever stop
I'm partying all night, I'm gonna make it pop

It's not about us, just forget about us
Tonight
Put your cigarette down, baby, light up the town
Beside me

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
Came tonight to put my work on display
Bringing New York down to St. Tropez

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
I won't fall in love, I won't ever stop
I'm partying all night, I'm gonna make it pop

"Pin-Up Galore"

Pin up girls at the roller derby
Take me down to Newark, New Jersey
American flags
Blue, blue streamers
Everybody's laughing
The crowd is cheering

Baby, I've become someone
Baby, I've become
Baby, I've become someone
Not of this world
Not of this world

Dance at night back in Alabama
Christmas lights on my teal-green trailer
American flags
Blue, blue streamers
All the men are watching
The crowd is screaming

Baby, I've become someone
Baby, I've become
Baby, I've become someone
Not of this world
Not of this world

Prizes, prizes
A diamond tiara
Here's to the girl with the blue mascara
I have a disco ball mind
Lights flashing all of the time
I have a disco ball mind
I wanna die, I wanna die
I wanna die, I wanna die

Ooh, ooh

Baby, I've become someone
Baby, I've become
Baby, I've become someone
Not of this world
Not of this world

"Pink Champagne"

I don't really wanna die
I just want the pain to be over
I know that I talked about it all the time, babe
Just wanted you to come over
I got tired of America
It got hard to just stay sober
Then I met you and you blew my mind
That was it, game over

We could get lost in the purple rain
Talk about the good old days
I could get drunk on some pink champagne
Lost in the purple haze

Let me love me like you a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be your one time beauty queen
You don't know the world like I do
You don't know how good our love can be
Let me love me like you a woman
Let me take you to infinity
Baby, take you to infinity
Baby

I don't really wanna fly
I just want this tour to be over
I know that I dreamed about it all my life
Then the dream got closer
I miss the smell of America
Green palms, green clover
I can still feel it when I close my eyes
It comes right over

We could get lost in the purple mist
Think about the good old times
Let it come down like the ocean wave
Hold your body in my mind

Let me love me like you a woman
Let me love you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be your one time beauty queen

You don't know the world like I do
You don't know how good people can be
Let me love me like you a woman
Let me take you to infinity
Baby, take you to infinity
Baby

I n-n-n-need you
Don't, don't fucking leave yet
I need, n-n-n-need you
Don't fu-, don't fucking leave yet

Let me love me like you a woman
Let me love you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be your one time beauty queen

You don't know the world like I do
You don't know how good people can be
Let me love me like you a woman
Let me love you like a baby
Baby, take you to infinity
Baby, take you to infinity

Baby, get drunk on some pink champagne
Get lost in the purple haze

Keep my feet on the ground
Pocket full of nursery rhymes
I'm just biding my time
Biding my lines

I'm wearing the invisible crown
You can't see it yet
Touring up and tearing the town, a soul sinner, yes
Sometimes I rap too
I'm a white girl, but the world is my oyster
I'm a little pearl, yep

They all know my name now
It's just another lonely day on the playground

Rain, rain go away, now

"Playing Dangerous"

Everybody knows I'm a good girl officer
No, I wouldn't do a thing like that, that's for sure
The house was already on fire, I swear I'm not a liar
Well I'm a little shaken, but I'm fine, thanks for asking
Tell me, do you always work alone so late
Gosh, I'm a little shy standing here in my nightgown
Do you really have to put those tight handcuffs on

Looking at me, then suddenly
I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane

I've been bad, I've been wrong
Playing a dangerous game
I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane, hurricane, hurricane

Let's get in the back of your cop car, officer
You can ask me anything you want
Anything, anything

Do you have a girl
I don't see a ring on your finger
Well that's interesting have you
Ever thought of dating a singer

The flames are getting higher
So is my desire
It's kind of exciting
Don't you think

Then suddenly he is uncuffing me
I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane

I've been bad, I've been wrong
Playing a dangerous game
I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane, hurricane, hurricane

If you can't stand the heat
Then stay out of the fire
You might get what you desire
Boy, love is strange
Sometimes it makes you crazy
It can burn or break you

If you can't stand the heat
Then stay out of the fire
You might get what you desire
Boy, love is strange
Sometimes it makes you crazy
It can burn or break you down

I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane

I've been bad, I've been wrong
Playing a dangerous game
I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane, hurricane, hurricane

"Prom Song (Gone Wrong)"

Boy, it's late, walk me home, put your hand in mine
At the gate, stop and say, "be my valentine"
You are, by far, the brightest star
I've ever seen, and I never dreamed
I'd be so happy that I could die

You used to say that I was beautiful like Cleopatra
But you the king, too, so I would say, "Back at ya"
I flip my hair and make you stare and put my make-up on
And make up stories 'bout my life and put on very cherry bomb
And even then, I knew that we were something serious
That you would dominate my thoughts like radio to Sirius
I'd see you in the hall like, "Hello, hello"
Up against the wall like, "Let's go, let's go"

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste within this teenage wasteland
You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me

If you're lonely, baby, hold me, you're my only one
Watching television, kissing 'til we see the sun
So far, we are safe in the dark
And I never dreamed that I'd be the queen
And I'd be so happy that I could die

You used to call yourself The Don and call me Queen Diana
You always make me blush and say, "Shut up boy, you bananas"
You pull my hair and push me down and chase me, make me run
You played me Biggie Smalls, and then my first Nirvana song
So even then, when no one's friends were really serious
I knew you loved me by the way you looked in second period
I'd see you in the hall like, "Hello, hello"
Up against the wall like, "Let's go, let's go"

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste within this teenage wasteland
You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me

I know that they say that all I want
Is to have fun
And get away for rainy days
I know that they think I've come undone
But I'm in love, I wanna run, run, run away
I'm leaving, are you coming with me

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste within this teenage wasteland
You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me

"Puppy Love"

It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love

You make me wanna be like one of those girls
From the 1950s wearing those big pearls
I'll cook you breakfast, coffee on your desk, yes
I might burn your toast but baby I'm still the bestest

It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love

You make me wanna be like one of those girls
On the color TV, it was a new world
The Dick van Dyke show, we're Cher and Bono
The way I sing "I Got You Babe", makes you say, "Oh, no."
Cause you're the class president without Jackie O
And I'm singing "Happy Birthday" like Marilyn Monroe

(One) This is not a school girl crush (No)
(Two) This is not puppy love (uh-uh)
It's the real thing when you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby

(One) This is not a school girl thing (No)
(Two) What about the diamond ring (uh-uh)
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it, baby

It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love

You make me wanna be like one of those girls
Calendar pin-up queen, in platinum curls
I'll do my summer pose, golden sand between my toes
You can pack my favorite snack, a Veuve Clicquot and Ho Hos
You're everybody's hero and you're hitting it hard
While I'm singing for the soldiers like Marilyn Monroe

(One) This is not a school girl crush (No) (Two)
This is not puppy love (uh-uh)
It's the real thing when you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby
(One) This is not a school girl thing (No) (Two)
What about the diamond ring (uh-uh)
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it, baby
And if I call you on the telephone, I might overdose
Cause I'm strong but I'm lonely like Marilyn Monroe
This is not a school girl crush
This is not puppy love

It's the real thing when you told me you loved me
What ever happened to hold me and trust me, baby (One)
This is not a school girl crush (No)

(Two) This is not puppy love (uh-uh)
It's the real thing when you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby
(One) This is not a school girl thing (No) (Two)
What about the diamond ring (uh-uh)
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it, baby
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love

What you do to me is indescribable
Got me sparkling just like an emerald

"Resistance"

Oh, baby, when you call me, I come to
From dreams I'll wake, and I'm waiting for you
Oh, baby, when you call me, I come to
I jump through hula hoops of fire just to get to you

You're making me crazy, oh, little baby
Shut your complaining, aye-aye-aye-aye
You make me so angry, someone should pay me
Why don't you get the sty-y-y-yle
Make me smile

Life's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul
You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance

Oh, honey, when you call me, I want to
Stay on the telephone for hours just to get you home
Oh, sugar, when you call me after school
I see your smile and I could run a methampheta-mile

I'll never forget it, oh, you'll regret it
Nowhere to kiss it, aye-aye-aye-aye
Take it or leave it, better believe it
You'll never see why-y-y-y
Say goodbye

Love's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul
You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance

New kind of porno
One that has yet been born, oh
Loving you's like loving a hurricane, I'm tired of
All the mess you make, all the hearts you break
Loving you's like loving a dirty bomb, you're blowing up
All the cash I'm paid, all the love we made

Love's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul

Love's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul
You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance
Your problem with commitment is
The bane of my existence

True love, it comes once
You messed it up, you stupid

"Ride"
(Music-Video Version)

[Spoken introduction]
I was in the winter of my life, and the men I met along the road were my only summer
At night I fell asleep with visions of myself, dancing and laughing and crying with them
Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour, and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me, and my only real happy times
I was a singer. Not a very popular one
I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet, but upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky that I wished on over and over again, sparkling and broken
But I didn't really mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted, and then losing it to know what true freedom is
When the people I used to know found out what I had been doing, how I'd been living, they asked me "Why", but there's no use in talking to people who have home
They have no idea what it's like to seek safety in other people, for home to be wherever you lay your head
I was always an unusual girl
My mother told me I had a chameleon soul, no moral compass pointing due north, no fixed personality just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean
And if I said I didn't plan for it to turn out this way I'd be lying
Because I was born to be the other woman
Who belonged to no one, who belonged to everyone
Who had nothing, who wanted everything, with a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldn't even talk about it, and pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me

I been out on that open road
But you can be my full-time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
But you can be my full-time baby, hot or cold

Don't break me down (Don't break me down)
I been traveling too long (I been traveling too long)
I been trying too hard (I been trying too hard)
With one pretty song (With one pretty song)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life and art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it, light 'til dark

Don't leave me now (Don't leave me now)
Don't say goodbye (Don't say goodbye)
Don't turn around (Don't turn around)
Leave me high and dry (Leave me high and dry)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
It's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just ride

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

[Spoken ending]
Every night I used to pray that I'd find my people, and finally I did on the open road
We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore, except to make our lives into a work of art
Live fast. Die young. Be wild. And have fun
I believe in the country America used to be
I believe in the person I want to become
I believe in the freedom of the open road
And my motto is the same as ever
"I believe in the kindness of strangers. And when I'm at war with myself I ride, I just ride."
Who are you
Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies
Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them
I have. I am fucking crazy
But I am free

"Roses"

(Uh, feeling's gone, feeling's gone)
(Uh, this love is dead)

You always buy me roses when I'm mad
Do you think I'll forgive you just like that
Did you forget who you were seeing, yeah
I'm not letting you off easy, I'm still sad

I'm kissing you hard, you got my lipstick on your face
I stole your girlfriend's keys, kicked her out of your place
Cause I want you more than I did before, -fore
I'm missing you hard, give you my soft-core baby face
And then we start to fight, tumble down the staircase
And when we hit that floor, you want me even more, more

And then you buy me roses and it's fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you're mine
I'll let you off easy, it's alright
And then you buy me roses and it's fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you're mine
I'll let you off easy, it's alright

You always buy me roses like a creep
Asking for forgiveness, unsexy
What happened to the man you used to be
If you still want my love then work for me

You're kissing me hard, you got my lipstick on your face
You show me what you got and put a girl in her place
If you want me more than you did before
(Uh, feeling's gone, feeling's gone)

And then you buy me roses and it's fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you're mine
I'll let you off easy, it's alright
And then you buy me roses and it's fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you're mine
I'll let you off easy, it's alright

We had conversations, ain't nothing said
This girl is crazy, I've done lost my head
"Her life is awesome", the doctor said
But my shit feel awful, this love is dead

And then you buy me roses and it's fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you're mine
I'll let you off easy, it's alright
And then you buy me roses and it's fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you're mine
I'll let you off easy, it's alright

See I could see the pain
In her eyes, in her eyes
This love is dead
This love is dead

"Run Motorcycle"

This is stupid, this whole sober
This is stupid, this whole sober thing
All the boys with me like to drink
This is stupid, this whole music thing
I'm burnt out, and I don't wanna sing

But I've got nothing better, but my sleeve
If life can't be fun, then I guess I'll have to leave
I said, "Run motorcycle run"
Run motorcycle run

Am I lovely Flowers in my hair
Do you love me You, yes you over there
Everybody asks me who I am
I'm nobody, I'm only a man

And I got nothing better, but my sleeve
If life can't be fun, then I guess I'll have to leave
So I say "Run motorcycle run"
Run motorcycle run
Run motorcycle run
Run motorcycle run

"Say Yes To Heaven"

If you dance, I'll dance
And if you don't, I'll dance anyway

Let the fear you have fall away

Say yes to Heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to Heaven
Say yes to me

If you go, I'll stay
You come back, I'll be right here

I've got my mind on you

Say yes to Heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to Heaven
Say yes to me

"Serene Queen"

"Serial Killer"

Wish I may, wish I might
Find my one true love tonight
Do you think that he could be you
If I pray really tight
Get into a fake bar fight
While I'm walking down the avenue
If I lay really quiet
I know that what I do isn't right
I can't stop what I love to do
So I murder love in the night
Watching them fall one by one, they fight
Did you think you'll love me too

Baby, I'm a sociopath
Sweet serial killer
On the warpath
'Cause I love you just a little too much
I love you just a little too much (much, much)
You can see me drinking Cherry Cola
Sweet serial killer
I left a love note
Said, you know I love the thrill of the rush
You know I love the thrill of the rush

Do it for the thrill of the rush
Love you just a little too much, much

Love you just a little too much, much

My black fire's burning bright
Maybe I'll go out tonight
We can paint the town in blue
I'm so hot, I ignite
Dancing in the dark and I shine
Like a light, I'm luring you
Sneak up on you really quiet
Whisper, "Am I what your heart desires"
I can be your ingenue
Keep you safe and inspired
Baby, let your fantasies unwind
We can do what you want to do

Baby, I'm a sociopath
Sweet serial killer
On the warpath
'Cause I love you just a little too much
I love you just a little too much (much, much)
You can see me drinking Cherry Cola

"She's Not Me"

Down, down, down
Mm, uh-huh
Huh, let's go

When you got her in the back seat
Driving round the back streets
Trying to block me out
(Do you remember my name)
Cruising down Santa Monica Boulevard
Does it light up the spark
(Do you remember my name)

Is she your ride-or-die bitch
Does she know I'm tattooed onto your heart
You can try to fight it
I have left my mark on you
There is nothing you can do

When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real-life suicide blonde
(You like that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me

When you take her to Chateau Marmont
'Cause you booked the top suite
Lay her on the bed
(Do you remember my name)
Strip her down to her bare ass
In her Kiki de Montparnasse
Like I used to have
(Do you remember my name)

Is she your ride-or-die bitch
Does she make you shiver under your skin
Just the way that I did
It won't be the same again
She don't compare to who I am

When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real-life suicide blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me

You try to forget and you tell her that you miss her
But I bet every time you go to kiss her
You get a hot rush feeling on your lips
It's me taking over you, throwing you a curve ball
Reminding you of our true romance and
Just like the first time you learned to dance and
I showed you all those moves she can't do
She's not me (me, me)

When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real-life suicide blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me
When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real-life suicide blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me

"So Legit"

You were the freak king of the piercing shop
All the girls thought they could sing
But they're really not, shit, I don't get it
You're looking like a man, you're talking like a baby
How the fuck is your song in a Coke commercial Crazy
I don't get it, your taste once exquisite

What happened to Brooklyn
What happened to New York
What happened to my scene
What happened to punk rock, rock

You called me the queen of the downtown scene, babe
How the fuck would you go switch it up and then replace me
I don't get it, I'm so legit

Tell me, was it 'cause I wasn't platinum in jewels
That perhaps, you thought I was a little bit of an uncool
Kid, was that it

Stefani, you suck, I know you're selling twenty million
Wish they could have seen you when we booed you off in Williamsburg
You're hurt, I know my words don't hurt ya

Oh, girl, I see you walking 'round in your pearls
Thinking that you're number one
You're so funny, 'cause honey, you're not

What happened to Brooklyn, the last frontier
They said you could make it anywhere if you can make it here
But where
No magic in the air

What happened to Brooklyn
What happened to our scene, baby
Have we all gone Gaga crazy
Remember when the streets used to be dangerous
And we were born bad
And we were born bad

Punk rock, punk rock
The boys used to punch each other in the face
And girls were walking 'round wasted
Everyone had a good night, come back in sunlight
Punk rock, rock, rock

"Starry Eyed"

Oh, boy, you're starry-eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You've got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

Life doesn't always work out like you planned it
They say, "Make lemonade out of lemons,"
But I try and I just can't understand it
All this trying for no good reason
Man makes plans and God laughs
Why do I even bother to ask, Honey
Well, once you and I, we were the king and queen of this town
It doesn't matter now
The sun's setting on our love, bye, baby

Oh, boy, you're starry-eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You've got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

Life doesn't always work out like you planned it
They say, "Make lemonade out of lemons,"
But I try and I can't understand it
All this begging for no good reason
Man makes plans and God laughs
Why do I even bother to ask, Honey
Well, once you and I, we were the king and queen of this town
It doesn't matter now
The sun's setting on our love, bye bye, baby

Oh, boy, you're starry-eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You've got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

It doesn't matter what they say
Let's go do it anyway
Cause you and I have an undying kind of love
You can be mine, I'll be yours, c'mon baby

Oh, boy, you're starry-eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You've got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

Oh, boy, you're starry-eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You've got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

"Stoplight De-Lite"

I had a man, he was sweet as pie
I met him as I waked right by him
He said, "Baby you so fine that when you walk
Even the stoplights stop talk about you
I saw you and I had to make you mine
'Cause you ultimately the most fine
You know a man like me
Gotta have a woman that's killer
She's got a be killer, killer, killer, baby"

Fly body, dope in the face
Fly body, dope in the face

The way you talk, well, you make me smile
And I'm looking down 'cause I'm kinda shy
You know you're so fine that when you talk
Even the roses get up to walk to you
You're crazy but I knew that at the time
I just cannot resist your golden grill
And your stupid pickup line

Fly body, dope in the face
Fly body, dope in the face

There's something about you when you say
"Come on, come on with me babe."
And I don't know why but I know
Wherever you go, I'm gonna follow

Fly body, don't mean a thing
Fly body, don't mean a thing
Fly body, dope in the face

You're gonna be the, you're gonna be the
You're gonna be the death of me
(Yes you are, you are)

You so fly, you so dope, babe
You so fly, you so dope, babe
Fly like a bird

"Strange Love"

Hey, stranger, my strange love
Would you be mine
Am I what you're dreaming of
Hey, stranger, my strange love
What makes you shine
What makes you fall in love

It's strange the way we met
A desert road and then
My car had stopped and you pulled off
On your black motorcycle
You rode me to the bar
We danced all night under
The Christmas lights and the dark black night
With the lightning and the thunder

Hey, stranger, my strange love
Would you be mine
Am I what you're dreaming of
Hey, stranger, my strange love
What makes you shine
What makes you fall in love

You took me to the edge
Of town, that's where you slept
You liked it best when no one else
Could find you or could bother
You poured us mint juleps
And kissed me the lips
You held me tight in the TV light
And you said you never loved her

You have a dark heart, like mine
Things that you've seen in dark time
Let me love you, let me touch you
Let me show you you'll be fine

Hey, stranger, my strange love
Would you be mine
Am I what you're dreaming of
Hey, stranger, my strange love
What makes you shine
What makes you fall in love

(feat. A$AP Rocky & Playboi Carti)

It's never too late to be who you wanna be
To say what you wanna say
It's never too late to leave if you wanna leave
Or to stay if you wanna stay
But, baby, I got a feeling in my bones
Can't get you out of my veins
You can't escape my affection
Wrap you up in my daisy chains

"Summer Of Sam"

Like the summer of Sam, back in '69
I'd be heavenly, deadly on the grind
'Cause to sing this nice has to be a crime
I be murdering and murdering 'em

Like the summer of love back in '69
You can say that I'm yours, but my body is divine
I belong to everybody that I walk by
Like hi, hi
I'm the master of my destiny
You haven't seen the best of me
And if you want the rest of me
You'll have to pay a lovely fee
Hard to stay far, far away from me
'Cause I am the baddest girl in NYC
You can look but please don't touch, boy
Stay away from me

Baby, I'm a cinnamon girl
Keeping it fresh on the far east side
Baby, I'm a tenement girl
Keeping it in touch, your cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Baby, I'm a dangerous girl
You should stay away from me

I've been murdering and murdering 'em
I be murdering and murdering 'em

Like the summer of Sam, back in '69
I'll be tying them up, and hang 'em out to dry
'Cause I'm hot like that when I walk, they die
I be murdering and murdering 'em

Like the summer of love back in '69
When I get on the microphone my, my
They be looking at each other like ay, ay, ay
Like bye, bye

Please excuse m-my vivacity, capacity for hating
'Cause it's incredible
It's better if you stay away from me
I know it's hard, hard to stay far, far away from me
I am the baddest girl in NYC
You can look but please don't touch
But boy, step away from me

Baby, I'm a cinnamon girl
Keeping it fresh, on the e-east side
Baby, I'm a tenement girl
Keeping it in touch, your cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Baby, I'm a dangerous girl
Baby, you should stay away from me

I've been murdering and murdering 'em
Happily
Murdering and murdering 'em ah, ah
Murdering and murdering 'em

I'm diggable, predictable
No, everyone knows all my people
I'll give you a fistful
You know you'll be in a fight
Unmissable, invincible, behavior is despicable
If you're looking for fun you can come out with me tonight

I am the baddest girl in NYC
I am the baddest, ya liking what you see Yup

Baby, I'm a cinnamon girl
Keeping it sweet, on the far east side
Baby, I'm a tenement girl
Keeping it in touch, your cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Honey, I'm a dangerous girl
You should stay away from me

"Summertime Sadness (Cedric Gervais Remix)"
(with Cedric Gervais)

I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feeling alive

Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzling like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness

I'm feeling electric tonight
Cruising down the coast, going about 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzling like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness

"Super Movie"

Drop me off at the Copacabana
You're my one true love, aren't you man, ah
I'm your little Super 8 movie
You know I'm in love with ya truly, yeah
So when, baby, if you
Don't get down (ah ah ah)
Don't get down

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
It's finally time to make a safe get away
I could not be happier

Drop me off, Santo Casino
I got an idea, why don't we go to Mexico
Like we said we would, and you, don't want, want to
But I think, I think it'd be good for you, Billy
You never want to do nothing anymore and I
Remember the days when you used to sway and you'd

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
It's finally time to make a safe get away
I love you, baby

What happened to us Me and you
I was funny once and you were funny, too
One day, we woke up and I found that we had grew
And only I wasn't me, I had come out blue
And you, I don't know what to make of you
You're not a color, you're more of a shape
Of your former self, like they say, babe
I remember the days when you'd

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
And I'll continue always to keep that way

Yellow, red or blue
Don't matter to me if it don't matter to you
We'll just keep on trucking and see what we do and
I remember every way that you love me, baby

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
Top down, howling "Vegas" all the way
We almost had it all, didn't we, baby

"Teenage Wasteland"

Boy, it's late, walk me home
Put your hand in mine
At the gates stop and say
"Be my Valentine."

You are by far
The brightest star
I've ever seen
And I never dreamed
I'd be so happy
That I could die

Used to say that I was beautiful
Like Cleopatra
But you the king too so I would say
"Back at'cha"

I flip my hair and make you stare
And put my make-up on
And make up stories 'bout my life
And put on Very Cherry Bomb

And even then I knew that we were
Something serious
That you would dominate my thoughts of
Radio Two serials

I'd see you in the hall like
"Hello, hello"
Up against the wall like
"Let's go, let's go"

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste
Within this teenage wasteland

You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place
Now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me

If you're lonely, baby, hold me
You're my only one
Watching television, kissing
'Til we see the sun

So far, we are
Safe in the dark
And I never dreamed
That I'd be the queen
And I'd be so happy
That I could die

You used to call yourself "the Don"
And called me "Queen Diana"
You always make me blush I say
"Shut up, boy, you bananas."

You pull my hair and push me down
And chase me, make me run
You play me Biggie Smalls and then
My first Nirvana song

So even then when no one's friends
Were really serious
I knew you loved me by the way
You looked in second period

I'd see you in the hall like
"Hello, hello"
Up against the wall like
"Let's go, let's go"

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste
Within this teenage wasteland

You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place
Now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me

I know that they say
That all I want
Is to have fun
And get away for rainy days

I know that they think
I've come undone
But I'm in love
I wanna run, run, run away

I'm leaving, are you coming with me

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste
Within this teenage wasteland

You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place
Now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me

"Television Heaven"

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Mm-mm, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Come on, come on

I hope you remember me like this
Smoking cigarettes in my sundress
Glamorous and gangster, oh yes
(My battle lines look like paradise next to you)
I hope I remember you just like that
Looking fresh to death in your ball cap
You say you'll tap it like a hi-hat
(Your stupid lines, they're like dynamite)

The future's looking bright as black tonight
You tell me that our love cannot endure
Baby, if it's wrong, I don't wanna be right
Oh, I don't know a thing of this, I'm sure

There's nowhere on this Earth I would rather be
Than in your bedroom breathing heavily
The way you're smiling, it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly, t-television heaven with you
Swinging in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothing but that t-t-television on
We're kissing in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that MT-TV on, t-television heaven with you
(And now, here's Johnny)

I wonder if you'll think of me like this
On your fire escape like a hot mess
You say, "You're beautiful but hopeless"
("Come on inside, oh, you crazy child, look at you")
I promise that I'll think of you as the king
Quoting Corleone like you're so mean
It's Cosa Nostra 'cause it's our thing
(I made you mine like a thousand times)

Lucy's in the sky with ice tonight
Heaven knows I've tried hard to find a cure
Baby, if it's wrong, I don't wanna be right
And if you ask again, I'll say I'm sure

There's nowhere on this Earth I would rather be
Than in your bedroom breathing heavily
The way you're smiling, it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly, t-television heaven with you
Swinging in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothing but that t-t-television on
We're kissing in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that MT-TV on, t-television heaven with you

Stay up tonight, turn out the light
It feels so right, baby, you're a vision in blues
Stay up tonight, turn out the light
It feels so right, watching television with you

There's nowhere on this Earth I would rather be
Than in your bedroom breathing heavily
The way you're smiling, it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly, t-television heaven with you
Swinging in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothing but that t-t-television on
We're kissing in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that MT-TV on, t-television heaven with you

"The Man I Love"

All that's real to me is Marilyn and Jesus
Jumping off of bridges
Sparklers and streamers, honey
I wanna fly, I wanna fly, I wanna fly

Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me
Don't you know that I have really never loved nobody but you
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me
Don't you know that I have really never loved nobody but you

All that's real to me is Halloween and Jesus
Coney Island beaches
Chandeliers and seizures, honey
I wanna fly, I wanna fly, I wanna fly
I can't be with the man I love
I can't be, if he treats me rough
I can't see him, I can't call him up
All that's real to me is trailer parks and beaches
Alabama breezes
Platinum and peaches, honey
I wanna fly, I wanna fly, I wanna fly
I can't be with the man I love
I can't be, if he treats me rough
I can't see him, I can't call him up

Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me
Don't you know that I have really never loved nobody but you
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me
Don't you know that I have really never loved nobody but you

"There's Nothing To Be Sorry About"

Little boy
Living without you won't be easy to do
Little boy
You are the love of my life
And if you don't wanna talk to me
Well, then I think that's alright

Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
My love

Knowing you are hurt inside
I think of all your happy times
Oh, my
When I ask what I can do
You say remember me the way I was six months ago, oh
I could do so much more for you, y'know
I could make you well if you just asked me to
Oh

Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
I'll do anything
For you or for him
Or whoever else needs some help out there
I swear, I swear

Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
Always

Think of you on quiet nights
At traffic lights and
Every highway and
I get a little scared sometimes when
Everyone I meet I find has
A friend

Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
My love

"Tired Of Singing The Blues"

You know, sometimes I think God is playing a little game with me
Looking down from heaven, laughing, and trying to see how much I can take
Because the way things go, it's like a joke
Nobody's had more shots at the moon, and missed, than me

It's like I got my life stuck, stuck on rewind
Trying to make something of myself, life's got something else in mind
I'm fighting a losing game and I'm biding my time
You won't be my man, do I understand No, stop
I don't want to hear another word about your 'Why not's'
I bought your bullshit all before, now you trying to sell me more, babe

Man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired

I'm walking down the streets, you wouldn't know what I was thinking
It's just another white girl day, hey ribbons in my hair, and I am sinking down
A double life, a sordid past, and I am drinking now
I want to be bad, you say you were glad to see me, shut up
I don't want to know another thing you think you know about me
I'm not who you think I am, smiling, but I ain't happy

Man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired

Oh, I'm so far gone, I can't turn off my mind
It's like a ticking time bomb
Trying to kill me from inside
Haunting day and night
Is there no remedy for memory

I've felt this way before I've known the depths of utter desperation
My boyfriend says I'm like an old movie star with loneliness as my occupation
I know that he's right but I don't care tonight
I want to be bad, I want to be bad, I can't stop
I keep running around the same town, knocking you down, I'm fucked
How can I get out when there's nowhere to go for miles around

A man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired

"Trash (Miss America)"

Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you

I'll do my hair up all high and wide, wild flowers tied
Green swimming pool pink flamingos, high Christmas lights
Blue bedspread and silver tinsel, my hearts delight

Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you

Do you like my fake nails daddy
Black palm tree pink tiger-stripes
Used to go to the kamfreena
Will you buy me a slice of cherry pie
We didn't know much, just worked at night
Sweet trailer light

1, 2
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you

He said, "Lana Rey, will you serve me lemonade"
And I said, "Yes, Bill, I will. It's the day of the parade
And you look even more handsome than you did
On the day that I left you
How do you spend your nights, honey
Still watching TV I long to be in your arms, honey
Come back to me
Please."

Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you
Don't ya wanna come to my motel honey
Don't ya wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me
Don't ya know that I have really never loved nobody, but you

All I want is to feel good
All I want is to feel good
All I want is to feel good, you know

Come on now if you want to

"TV In Black And White"

If you get lonely, think of me only
Prison isn't going to keep me from you
Remember Coney Island and how we
Went into the water, 'til the waves turned blue
Nobody does have to know that our love's alive
Keep it on the low if you want to hide
Got that same address if you want to write
One Greenwich Avenue, wishing and thinking of you

Living without you's like TV in black and white
You turned me on and brought color into my life
When I'm around you, suddenly, I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

If you get lonely, think of this only
Heaven hasn't forgotten about you
Though you can't hold me, pick up and phone me
Use your one phone call on your ex girl, boo
I won't tell a single soul how you spend your nights
In that single cell, holding your pillow tight
If you really are afraid, then you ought to know
That you're the one I want, the one I want forever more

Living without you's like TV in black and white
You turned me on and brought color into my life
When I'm around you, suddenly, I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

I know you get scared sometimes, boy
Nothing to be feared when you're in my heart
Troubles come in threes but in your case
They came in millions and trillions, but that's all right

Living without you's like TV in black and white
You turned me on and brought color into my life
When I'm around you, suddenly, I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white

"Unidentified Flying Bill"

Bill takes me down to the beach
In the coat that he got from his father
He whispers to me that sometimes
He thinks he sees things over the water
Like maybe UFOs or something
Flying in the air
Well, I don't know about those, Bill
But I don't care

Slow burn, I'm hot like a fire
I'm sober, but you're getting higher
Life is so crazy, I can't take it
But at least we've got the night
We still got tonight

Bill takes me down to the beach
In East Hampton and walks on the water
Says they don't know it yet
But I'm the second coming of the Father
And he keeps on fishing
Tryna turn one into twenty
He's turnin' the ocean into wine for the summertime

Slow burn, I'm hot like a fire
I'm sober, but you're getting higher
Life is so crazy, I can't take it
But at least we've got tonight
We still got tonight
We still got tonight
We still got tonight

Tell it to me
Tell me I'm wrong
Come to me
Come to me
Tell me I'm wrong
Come to me
Send me, now
Tell me I'm wrong
(Tell me I'm wrong)
Ohh

Slow burn, I'm hot like a fire
I'm sober, but you're still getting higher
Life is so crazy, I can't take it
But at least we've got the night
We still got the night

"Velvet Crowbar"

I was addicted to you but I didn't know it
You were afflicted by booze
You didn't show it huh

Life is a velvet crowbar
Hitting you over the head
You're bleeding but you want more
"This is so like you," I said
Put yourself on back to bed

You're like crack to me I don't want to leave
I'm watching you sleep, afraid you'll stop breathing
My baby's on his eighth life darling
Staying with him 'til the morning

You're like crack to me so fun I can't see
With your golden grill, your purple dream
My baby's on his eighth life darling
Gonna watch him 'til the morning

I was addicted to you didn't wanna blow it
You were a dick with your crew
Always on the road

You wanna touch life so hard
Why can't you give it a rest
You're not that bright for a star
Burned yourself out nothing left
Burned yourself out nothing left

You're like crack to me I don't want to leave
I'm watching you sleep, afraid you'll stop breathing
My baby's on his eighth life darling
Staying with him 'til the morning

You're like crack to me so fun I can't see
With your golden grill, your purple dream
My baby's on his eighth life darling
Gonna watch him 'til the morning

Styrofoam on the microphone
Can't give it up, can't go it alone
Flame-colored paradise for you darling
But death doesn't come with a warning

Life is a velvet crowbar
Hitting you over the head
You're bleeding syrup amour
Bleeding to death

You're like crack to me I don't want to leave
I'm watching you sleep, afraid you'll stop breathing
My baby's on his last life darling
I'm staying with him 'til the morning

You're like crack to me so fun I can't see
With your golden grill, your purple dream
My baby's on his eighth life darling
Gonna watch him 'til the morning
Gonna stay with him 'til morning

My baby's on his eighth life, darling
(Gonna stay around 'til morning)

My baby's on his eighth life, darling
And death doesn't come with a warning

"Wait"

Wait a little longer kid
What you want to grow up so fast for
Why you doing like I did
Didn't you say I got what I asked for

But you're afraid to find out
Like me and climb out
But you're always close to me
You got a different story
It's the same damn thing
Got a long way, rest your feet
I know you can do anything

You were such a handsome boy
Don't you give up your glory
Why you want to hit them streets
Didn't you never hear my story

And it's fine to waste time
But you got a beautiful mind
And you're always close to me
You're a different kid
But it's the same damn thing
And it's a long way, you better rest your feet
I know that you want everything

That's what you told me
I still believe you
I still see it's true
I need you and I know you, dear
But if you've gotta make it then
I can take it from here

Wait a little longer kid
Didn't I never say I would miss you
Don't go until I come home
Please don't go until I kiss you

And it's hard to grow up
But we all know it's tough
Yeah, you're always close to me
You have a different story
It's the same damn thing
You got a long way, c'mon and rest your feet
I know you can do anything

"Watercolor Eyes"
(from "Euphoria" soundtrack)

Why you always doing that
Breaking up with me then making up
Just to make me mad

I think that you taste like rock candy
Sweet like beaches, leave me all sandy
Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes
Young love don't always last forever
Wild horses can't keep us together
So what if you taste just like heaven
That don't make it right
Hot summer and cold watermelon
Your love stings like blood and a lemon
Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes

Watercolor eyes, watercolor eyes, watercolor eyes
That don't make it right

Why you always doing that
Playing guitar while I'm sleeping
Acting like a brat

I think that you're sweet like rock candy
Warm like beaches that leave me sandy
Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes
Young love don't always last forever
Wild horses can't keep us together
So what if you taste just like heaven
That don't make it right
Hot summer and cold watermelon
Your love stings like blood and a lemon
Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes

Watercolor eyes, watercolor eyes, watercolor eyes
That don't make it right
Watercolor eyes, watercolor eyes, watercolor eyes
That don't make it right

Why you always doing that
Breaking up with me then making up just to make me mad
Oh, hey-hey, why
That don't make it right

"Wayamaya"

He was a big wave surfer
Living down by Waimea Bay
We had a few friends
Never thought it would end

I remember an all white day with 8-story waves
He said, "Your eyes are gray." (Beautiful)
We were living on Cte d'Alene
On Carol Lane, sun Manta Ray

Driving in our Mercury down to Waimea
Driving in our Mercury
Driving in our Mercury down to Waimea
Driving in our Mercury

I remember we came in May
And we changed our names to Lana and Ray
We be up 'til the sun rose, ay
I'm in gold Lam, your pink floral, hey

Driving in our Mercury down to Waimea
Driving in our Mercury
Driving in our Mercury down to Waimea
Driving in our Mercury

Waikiki-ko, Waikiki-ko
Waikiki, Waikiki, Waikiki-ko
Waikiki-ko, Waikiki-ko
Waikiki, Waikiki, Waikiki-ko

"Westbound"

You didn't think about anyone else
You didn't think about any of us
When you left that place
You didn't want to go anywhere else
Nothing could satisfy you 'til you left
So you went away

Where did you go
Where are you now
I ask about
So many of my friends
Oh, about their ends
What about us
Are we just dust
On the floor again
I thought we were on the mend

You really put me in a quite a position
You got me struggling as a musician
With a song
You like to write about all of your problems
Put them in songs because you think it will solve them
But you're wrong

Why did you go
I guess I know
Maybe my question is
Why must it come to this
You talk about
Being strong, yeah
How I want to be
You and your melody

Trying to learn about something important
You keep taking up space, you're annoying
But I love you so
Yeah, you already know
They're trying to teach me about new ways of living
They're trying to teach me about ways of forgiving
But you make it hard
You're such a bad, bad boy

I love you anyway
No matter what they say
You were not approved
But you are on the moon
I care about
How this turns out
It's just more than I
Ever knew how to fight
I guess I won't
Tell me I have to
Tell me I have to
I know you could
I said I know you could
Where are you now
I ask about

"What's A Girl To Do"

Don't tell me that I'm fine
You break me all the time when you don't mean to
Yo, heartbreak's not a crime
But maybe it should be when it comes to you
I don't really know why you do them things
But maybe now, baby, if I start to sing
I can knock a little sense into you

What's a stupid girl to do
When she loves somebody as fucked up like you
Where am I supposed to go
When the only boy I ever knew said no
Absolutely nothing

Don't tell me it's alright
You never really knew what you meant to me
I'm, I'm crying every night
Because everything's so strange when you're not with me

And I don't really know why you had to go
But I have to trust that only God can know
If I pray, maybe I'll find out what's true

What's a stupid girl to do
When she loves somebody as fucked up like you
Where am I supposed to go
When the only boy I ever knew said no
Absolutely nothing

Ahh, ahh, uh uh oh
Ahh, ahh, uh uh oh

You break me down
I get back up
You're telling me
I say "What's up"
Nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing
Can't go back to you

What's a stupid girl to do
When she loves somebody as fucked up as you
And where am I supposed to go
When the only boy I ever loved said no
Absolutely nothing

Absolutely nothing, no
Absolutely nothing
Absolutely nothing, no
Absolutely nothing
Absolutely nothing, no
Absolutely nothing

"Wild One"

Can't be bitter when I talk about him, Mike
I should have known better but I left without him and I
I used to dance for him, dance for him
I used to dance every Saturday night
I used to shake it for him, shake it for him
I want to stay but there's something ain't right

I'm wild, I'm free
No man can handle me
I write, I sing
Freedom's my love, God is my king
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one

I ain't no sinner, but sometimes I wonder why
It's the middle of winter but in my mind it's summer, Mike
Used to move for you, move for you
Was a pleasure and the pleasure was mine

I'm wild, I'm free
No man can handle me
I write and I sing
Freedom's my love, God is my king
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one

God bless America
God bless the world at large
Guide these two wheels of ours
Right to the stripes and stars

I'm wild, I'm free
No man can handle me
I write and I sing
Freedom's my love, God is my king

I'm wild, I'm free
No man can handle me
I write and I sing
Freedom's my love, God is my king

I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one

"Yes To Heaven"

If you dance I'll dance
And if you don't I'll dance anyway
Give peace a chance
Let the fear you have fall away

I've got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you

Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me

If you go I'll stay
You come back I'll be right here
Like a barge at sea
In the storm I stay clear

'Cause I've got my mind on you
I've got my mind on you

Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me

If you dance I'll dance
I'll put my red dress on again
And if you fight I'll fight
It doesn't matter, now it's all gone

I've got my mind on you
I've got my mind on you

Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me

I've got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you
I've got my mind on you

"You & Me"

Got a light in your eyes, I can see it
Look into my mind to believe it
Try hard to remember the beach
Blue water from the sea, hands all over me
Tattoos, they were glistening
It's been so long since someone made me different

Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Be free and alive
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Just feel alive
It's just you and the sun, it's just you and the sun now baby

Gonna light up the skies, I can see it
You're God's favorite child, boy, believe it
Try hard to remember the days
Sick as fucking cyanide
Diamonds and getting blazed
Your tattoos, still magnificent
No longer high, but you're not very different

Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Be free and alive
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Just feel alive
It's just you and the sun, it's just you and the sun now baby

I get so damn tired
You set my soul on fire
Ignite me, inspired
Make me higher and higher

Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Be free and alive
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Just feel alive
It's just you and the sun, it's just you and the sun now baby

"You Can Be The Boss"

You taste like the Fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my
I love you but I don't know why

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Don't let it stop
You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don't let it stop

He had a cigarette with his number on it
He gave it over to me, "Do you want it"
I knew it was wrong but I palmed it
I saved it, I waited, I called it
The liquor on your lips, the liquor on your lips
The liquor on your lips makes you dangerous
I knew it was wrong, I'm beyond it
I tried to be strong but I lost it

You taste like the Fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Don't let it stop
You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don't let it stop

He has a white corvette like I want it
A fire in his eyes, know, I saw it
He's bleeding from his brain and his wallet
He's sick and he's taken but honest
The liquor on your lips, the liquor on your lips
The liquor on his lips I just can't resist
As close as I'll get to the darkness
He tells me to, "Shut up, I got this"

You taste like the Fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Don't let it stop
You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don't let it stop

I need you, I need you babe
Like I never needed anyone
You're wrong but you're so much fun
You say you treat 'em mean
To keep 'em keen
But you, you're not that nice
But you taste like the Fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Don't let it stop
You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don't let it stop

All the gin joints
In all the towns in all the world
She walks into mine

"You're Gonna Love Me"

Cherry says that anytime
I think I have a good idea
That I should do the opposite
Of whatever it is I feel
And that's because I have a bad mind
And I have gold in my veins
But he says I got the purest heart
That he's ever seen

What'd God give me a brain for
He won't help me use it
What'd God give me a plan for
If he won't help me do it

You're gonna love me
I'm gonna make you
You're gonna love me
I'm gonna make you

Well I can tell that you're the type
To never trust a beauty queen
But I was never voted for nothing
And high school never meant
Anything to anybody
Never ever gave myself away
But even when I'm funny
You think I'm acting, so I say

What'd God give me a brain for
If he won't let me use it
What'd God give me a plan for
He never helps me do it

You're gonna love me
I'm gonna make you
You're gonna love me
I'm gonna make you

You say that you don't want to be hypnotized
But baby I, I don't want to hypnotize you
There's nothing from you that I want to take
I just want to be like you
(Maybe love you just a little bit)
Please

Jim, I'mma dedicate this whole album to you
You told me to get my way
That's exactly what I'm gonna do
I'm going to strike out, right now
I'm striking out right now with this song
But I can't help myself
I can't do right for long
You know that

What God give me a brain for
He knows that I can't use it
I don't know why he'd give me a plan for
He never lets me do it

You're gonna love me
I'm gonna make you
You're gonna love me
I'm gonna make you

"You, Mister"

I'm doing alright, most of the time
In fact, yesterday, I was even doing real well and I
Think that I might claim you as mine
So that my head can rest and everybody can tell, and I

Had a strange dream and I
Called you at night and I
Had to make known that I wasn't alright
And say that I had you on my mind
Had you on my mind

I make it a point to rest through my day
To close my eyes and visualize my troubles away and I
Think of you here and I close my eyes tight
Somehow the vision of you near makes me feel alright and I

Had a strange dream and I
Called you at night and I
Had to make known that I wasn't alright
And say that I had you on my mind
Had you on my mind

Had you on my mind
Had you on my mind
Had you on my mind

"Young And Beautiful"
(from "The Great Gatsby" soundtrack)

I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful

I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful

Dear Lord, when I get to heaven
Please, let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that You'll let him in
Father, tell me if You can
All that grace, all that body
All that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful

Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful
Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful

"Your Band Is All The Rage"

I think we're losing what we used to have, you know
You loved me better one year ago, oh
Don't let me down, don't let me down so low

But I won't be ashamed if you leave me
I won't be all that mad if you go
'Cause I know, yes I know

You always spending all that stupid time
With your band on the road
But your band is all the rage
So I've been told
But you can still come home
You can still come home when you want
And I won't be ashamed to take you back in
Won't be ashamed to put a kiss on your lips
'Cause I know, I know

Boy, don't call me up quickly on the phone
It's been five nights since I heard the tone of your voice
You act like everything's alright
But we both know, we both know that it's not
And it's far from ever being good again
Darling, I'm gonna love you forever
If you come back, I'll take you back in baby
Back in, baby, back in, back in

I love you more than I will even know
You're so special
I guess that's why you got it where you go
But when you get real big, baby
Remember that little old cowgirl
Waiting for you back in that Red River Valley
Waiting back in that Tallahassee
I love you

"Your Girl"

Carry me off the stage
I can't do this anymore
Been gone for 3 years
Is that enough for you boy

Carry me to my bed, paint my toe nails blue
Tell me all about the things that you and I will never do

I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah

Carry me off the stage
Had too much to drink
Been on tour too long
And I've had too much time to think

Carry me to my bed
Lay me in a pillow town
Kiss me on my head
And remind me of the way we will not know

I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah

Late at night, baby you're my sign
Call me late if you wanna get high
Late at night, laying in Versailles
You and I get to know one another

Late at night, baby you're my sign
Call me late if you wanna get high
Late at night, baby you and I
Can get to know one another

Cause late at night, we have one life to kill
Oh you and I
Can get to know the thrill
Cause baby you're my sign
And I wanna get to know ya

I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah

(Ah)
(Ah)
(Ah)

"Friend"

Pictures of the old us got me feelin' older
I just thought you should know I never wanted closure
But you had no problem leavin'
Now I'm the one to feel it

I just can't believe you don't know what I'm feelin'
Guess you got the best of this
Pickin' up the pieces, you just wanna leave 'em
Killin' me a little bit
And I hate the way you love me
And I hate that I still care
Funny how you feel like we would ever talk again
How could you think I'd be your friend

I'm sure you're doin' fine, but I don't wanna hear it
And if I left my T-shirt, you can keep it

I don't wanna see you again if it's different
'Cause I'll only see all the things that I'm missin'
And I should've cut all the ties, but I didn't
I didn't let go

I just can't believe you don't know what I'm feelin'
Guess you got the best of this (Guess you got the best of this)
Pickin' up the pieces, you just wanna leave 'em
Killin' me a little bit (Killin' me a little bit)
And I hate the way you love me
And I hate that I still care (I still care)
Funny how you feel like we would ever talk again
How could you think I'd be

You had no problem leavin'
Now I'm the one to feel it

I just can't believe you don't know what I'm feelin'
Guess you got the best of this (Guess you got the best of this)
Pickin' up the pieces, you just wanna leave 'em
Killin' me a little bit (Killin' me a little bit)
And I hate the way you love me
And I hate that I still care (I still care)
So funny how you feel like we would ever talk again
How could you think I'd be your friend

"21"

I missed your 21st birthday, I been up at 'em
Almost tried to call you, don't know if I should
Hate to picture you half drunk, happy
Hate to think you went out without me

I'm sorry if you blame me, if I were you I would
Thought you'd see it comin' but you never could
I still haven't heard from your family
But you said your mom always loved me

Sometimes I go blurry-eyed
Small talk and you tell me that you're on fire
Lights on and it's black and white
I couldn't stay forever

I see the look in your eye and I'm biting my tongue
You'll be the love of my life when I was young
When the night is over don't call me up
I'm already under

I get a little bit alone sometimes and I miss you again
I'll be the love of your life inside your head
When the night is over don't call me up
I'm already under

Audrey said she saw you out past twelve o'clock
Just because you're hurting doesn't mean I'm not
If it doesn't go away by the the time I turn 30
I made a mistake and I'll tell you I'm sorry (Sorry)

Sometimes I go blurry-eyed
Small talk and you tell me that you're on fire
Lights on and it's black and white
I couldn't stay forever

I see the look in your eye and I'm biting my tongue
You'll be the love of my life when I was young
When the night is over don't call me up
I'm already under

I get a little bit alone sometimes and I miss you again
I'll be the love of your life inside your head
When the night is over don't call me up
I'm already under

"Under  Over"

Funny when I think about the months
That I could not get out of bed
Going back and forth over the letters that I wrote but never sent
Wake up and repeat it
But I was barely sleeping
Swimming in the memories, I'm floating in the deep end
How come you're not still in my head

I got, you got, we got too much time on our hands
Used to be so caught up
In the things we had planned
I'm not chasing feelings that I don't understand
I'm underwater
But I'm over you

Thought that I'd be good the day
I took down all your pictures in my room
How'd it go from easier to everything still leading back to you

Can I be honest I think about you constantly
You're closing every door
But now I'm looking for an opening
Maybe I'm just getting confused

I got, you got, we got too much time on our hands
Used to be so caught up
In the things we had planned
I'm still chasing feelings that I don't understand
I'm underwater
Am I over you

"tehe"

We played grown-up
Drowned in bathtubs
But you never opened up
And I never said enough

Thunder warning
Should've called it
But we never gave it up

Now I know it wasn't right, wasn't right
We pretended to hold it
Went quiet
And we blamed it on the time
On the time
On the timing, we broke it
Went silent

Slept on floors of
Angry mornings
But you never let me in
So I stopped wanting it
Tearing every wall and
Breaking down the doors
Kept bending every rule
Till all of me was yours
And pushing things aside
But nothing ever worked
Worked

Now I know it wasn't right
Wasn't right
We pretended to hold it
Went quiet
And we blamed it on the time
On the time
On the timing, we broke it
Went silent

Tearing every wall and
Breaking down the doors
Kept bending every rule
Till all of me was yours
And pushing things aside
But nothing ever worked
Worked

Now I know it wasn't right
Wasn't right
We pretended to hold it
Went quiet
And we blamed it on the time
On the time
On the timing, we broke it
Went silent

"I Miss You, I'm Sorry"

Do you remember
Happy together
I do
Don't you

Then all of a sudden
You're sick to your stomach
Is that
Still true

Said forever, in the end, I fought it
Please be honest, are we better for it
Thought you'd hate me but instead you called and
Said, "I miss you," I caught it

Good to each other
Give it the summer
I knew
You too

But I only saw you
Once in December
I'm still
Confused

You said forever and I almost bought it
I miss fighting in your old apartment
Breaking dishes when you're disappointed
I still love you, I promise

Nothing happened in the way I wanted
Every corner of this house is haunted
And I know you said that we're not talking
But I miss you, I'm sorry

I don't wanna go
Think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us

I don't wanna go
We been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you

I don't wanna go
Think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us

I don't wanna go
We been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you

I don't wanna go
Think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us

I don't wanna go
We been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you

I don't wanna go
Think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us

I don't wanna go
We been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you

"Long Sleeves"

Packing while you're asleep
You were the catalyst
I don't know what it is about how you breathe
About how you breathe

I want to be alone
Hate it that no one knows, you're good to everyone
All them but me
All them but me

And if you hear me leaving in the morning
Could you just pretend that it was only wind

'Cause I can't love you even if I want to
Got a lot to work through
You don't know where I've been

It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming

Say something sweet to me
It never meant a thing
Used to the turbulence
I wore long sleeves
I wore long sleeves

Fought till you tethered me
Swept under surfaces
Never enough of it
You didn't think
You didn't think

If you hear me leaving in the morning
Could you please pretend that it was only wind

'Cause I can't love you even if I want to
Got a lot to work through
You don't know where I've been

It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming

Coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down

Coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming

Coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down

"minor"

Hit me 310
And I'll be home at some point
Past sundown, because traffic
You already know that, oh
I'll put on a show
If you just come over
I'm sorry your house is in Glendale
Or somewhere far

I would drive all night to get to you
But my curfew is early and mom's up at home
I would run for miles to get to you
But you gotta understand, I can't 'cause

M-I-N-O-R
I'm minorly stuck
And it's not your fault
Just how things are
M-I-N-O-R
I'm all out of luck
I'm minorly stuck, oh

Hit me 310
We'll meet by the freeway
It's shady, but better than nothing
Oh, take my word
I grew up not far, but never been down here
At this time
Your house is in Glendale
Or somewhere far

I would drive all night to get to you
But my curfew is early and dad's at the door
I would run for miles to get to you
But you gotta understand, I can't 'cause

M-I-N-O-R
I'm minorly stuck
And it's not your fault
Just how things are
M-I-N-O-R
I'm all out of luck
I'm minorly stuck

M-I-N-O-R
I'm minorly stuck
And it's not your fault
Just how things are
M-I-N-O-R
I'm all out of luck
I'm minorly stuck

"Feels Like"

Oh
We almost got away, we cut it close
The city's getting loud, if I choke
It's only 'cause I'm scared to be alone
Been trying to work it out, you should know

I would do whatever you wanted
We don't have to leave the apartment
Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like

Living in a movie I've watched and
Funny 'cause I couldn't have called it
Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like

Oh
The train was cold, we left Connecticut
We stayed a couple hours, our clothes
Matched enough to throw me off a bit
Your phone was playing Towers, and I

I would do whatever you wanted
We don't have to leave the apartment
Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like

Living in a movie I've watched and
Funny 'cause I couldn't have called it
Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like

And I need you sometimes
We'll be alright

Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like

And I miss you some nights
We'll be alright

Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like

I would do whatever you wanted
We don't have to leave the apartment
Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like

"Rockland"

Hey
I feel like I might say the wrong thing
I hung up when I started calling
You probably would've laughed then
If you had seen it happen

Hey
Who took my place in bed when I left
Who laughs at everything that you've said
I'm sure that I would like her
If I were slightly nicer

Bet you
Wish you
Never even met me
I don't
Blame you
Broke your every heartbeat

Hey
I parked across the street from your house
The lights were on the music got loud
I doubt you would've seen me
I hid from everybody

Hey
I feel like if we gave it one night
You'd hate me less and make it alright
Just wish that we could fight now
I'd hold you on the comedown

Bet you
Wish you
Never even met me
I don't
Blame you
Broke your every heartbeat

Bet you
Wish you
Never even met me
I can't
Blame you
Broke your every heartbeat

I see you every night in my sleep
Anticipating every bad dream
Like falling with a knife you cut deep
You cut deep
You cut deep

I see you every night in my sleep
Anticipating every bad dream
Like falling with a knife you cut deep
You cut deep

Bet you
Wish you
Never even met me
I don't
Blame you
Broke your every heartbeat

Bet you
Wish you
Never even met me
I can't
Blame you
Broke your every heartbeat

I see you every night in my sleep
Anticipating every bad dream
Like falling with a knife you cut deep
You cut deep
You cut deep

I see you every night in my sleep
Anticipating every bad dream
Like falling with a knife you cut deep
You cut deep
You cut deep

"For Real This Time"

I think that maybe I was right
Back when I knew to draw the line
Already gave what I could offer
Maybe we'll work another time

I guess the thought of it's enough
No going back or switching up
I really wish that I could do that
Walking away from you is tough

I know we've run it dry
I've heard that happens sometimes
I shouldn't be surprised
Should I

I've packed my bags in the middle of the night
A thousand times I got up to say goodbye
I could be wrong but I think that I'm for real this time

I've taken down all the pictures in my room
I've hidden things that reminded me of you
I know I've lied but I think that I'm for real this time

Couldn't you tell when I was off
You never asked me what it was
I kind of hope you feel the same way
So that I'm not the only one

Who thinks we've run it dry
But still we've stayed a long time
I'm sorry if I make you cry tonight

'Cause I've packed my bags in the middle of the night
A thousand times I got up to say goodbye
I could be wrong but I think that I'm for real this time

I've taken down all the pictures in my room
I've hidden things that reminded me of you
I know I've lied but I think that I'm for real this time

I know that I've lied
But we're running dry
Know I won't come back this time

I know that I've lied
But we're running dry
Think that I'm for real this time

I've packed my bags in the middle of the night
A thousand times I got up to say goodbye
I could be wrong but I think that I'm for real this time

"Camden"

I never said it but I know that I
Can't picture anything past twenty-five
Not like I care to know the timing
Not like I'm looking for that silence
Self-diagnosing 'til I'm borderline
I'll do whatever helps to sleep at night
Until I'm feeling like an island
Until I'm strong enough to hide it
What was I thinking looking for a sign
As if I've ever seen the stars align
Somebody take over the driving
Somebody notice how I'm trying

Somebody notice how I'm trying

When I'm toeing that line
All of the time
Calling it fine
Calling it fine
Toeing that line
All of the time
Calling it fine
Calling it fine

How do you call it when
You're in your head
Like when you're really keep inside of it
I only talk into the mirror
I'm only scared of getting bigger
At least I'll never turn to cigarettes
My brother shielded me from all of that
He said that smoking was a killer
He said he knows that I've been bitter
Maybe I'm waiting for the go ahead
The validation that I never get
Most of the game is unfamiliar
Most of the girls are getting thinner

When I'm toeing that line
All of the time
Calling it fine
Calling it fine
Toeing that line
All of the time
Calling it fine
Calling it fine

All of me, a wound to close
But I leave the whole thing open
I just wanted you to know
I was never good at coping
All of me, a wound to close
But I leave the whole thing open
I just wanted you to know
I was never good at coping
All of me, a wound to close
But I leave the whole thing open
I just wanted you to know
I was never good at coping
All of me, a wound to close
But I leave the whole thing open
I just wanted you to know
I was never good at coping

I never said it but I know that I
Can't picture anything past twenty-five
Not like I care to know the timing
Not like I'm looking for that silence
I never said it but I know that I
I bury baggage 'til it's out of sight
I think it's better if I hide it
I really hope that I'll survive this

"The Bottom"

I told you I was down bad
You hate to see my like that
I don't know how you look passed
My stupid fucking setbacks

When you opened up the door
You let me in when you should have your guard up
What a painful back and forth
Oh

It's hard to ignore all of my problems
Gonna regret being too honest
Calling it love but this isn't falling
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom

'Cause I'm no good
You could do better
You should walk out
It's now or never
I took the most that you could offer
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom

I told you I was down bad
You could never fix that
I'm happier when I'm sad
So leave and never come back

When you opened up the door
You let me in when you should have your guard up
What a painful back and forth
Oh

It's hard to ignore all of my problems
Gonna regret being too honest
Calling it love but this isn't falling
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom

'Cause I'm no good
You could do better
You should walk out
It's now or never
I took the most that you could offer
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom

Watch me drag you down
No saving you now
Watch me drag you down
There's no getting out
Watch me drag you down
No saving you now
Watch me drag you down

It's hard to ignore all of my problems
Gonna regret being too honest
Calling it love but this isn't falling
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom

'Cause I'm no good
You could do better
You should walk out
It's now or never
I took the most that you could offer
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom

"Wishful Thinking"

Meet you down at the bottom
Finish a bottle
You know I know all your problems now

Flaked on me back in August
And if I'm honest
You've gotten harder to figure out

I know that you got everything you wanted
I heard a rumor everybody's talking
About you now

I really thought that I could fix this
But nothing's different
How come I'm stuck on thinking you'd grow up
I really hoped that we'd be passed this
Problems past tense
Is it just wishful thinking that you'd grow up

Dropped it all in a second
After your message
Do you remember me calling out

Meet you back in the wreckage
Right where you left it
Do you regret how I see you now

You said that you got better you saw me
I heard a rumor
It's medicine and molly
You're blacking out

I really thought that I could fix this
But nothing's different
How come I'm stuck on thinking you'd grow up
I really hoped that we'd be passed this
Problems past tense
Is it just wishful thinking that you'd grow up

"Older"

Pinch me now
You're caught in my crossfire
Fell into my arms but they got tired
We were so good, weren't we
Till it just stopped working

Almost like we tore out the same page and
Left a lot of room for new mistakes
You never quite let me in
When you felt cracks again

I stopped waving a flag
I just dropped all caring for that
I went quiet
And you went cold
Guess that happened
When we got older

Humor me
Could taking a break be the better thing
Just letting each other breathe
Won't you just look at me
Or am I too draining

You spent hours awake holding back
I know I'm to blame for the small talk and tip toeing over
Guess that happened when we got older

You spent hours awake holding back
I know I'm to blame for the small talk and tip toeing over
Guess that happened when we got older

"Better"

Don't feel it all
Talk slow and leveled
Foot off the pedal
Same shirt and perfume on

The two of us were accidental
But so good together
Now all I feel is

So bad about it
I barely left my bed
We talk around it
All for nothing

So if that's all it was
If you're good giving in, giving up
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now
And if that's what you want
If you don't wanna see me at all now
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now

It's been a while
Old clothes fit larger
You're looking smaller
What happened when I left

I'm still sad about it
You've barely left my head
We talk around it
All for nothing

So if that's all it was
If you're good giving in, giving up
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now
And if that's what you want
If you don't wanna see me at all now
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now

I'd turn the car round if you'd let me
If you let me, you let me
You know I'd cry my eyes out till I'm empty
Till I'm empty, I'm empty

So if that's all it was
If you're good giving in, giving up
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now
And if that's what you want
If you don't wanna see me at all now
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now

Hope you feel better now
Hope you feel better

"Hard To Sleep"

I only thought it for a minute but it got me down
That kind of feeling when you've got something to cry about
And all the talking turned to screaming that I couldn't help
This isn't me, me, me
I only thought it for a moment but it's crippling
I guess the gravity have growing out of sinking in
What if I'm missing the capacity for all of it
This isn't me, me, me

And I'm so scared of losin' all control
Don't you tell me it's better to let go
When the weight of the world feels so close
It's only me, me, me

Audrey told me that she thinks I might be in my head
How I'm overthinking everything I never said
How it's killing me a little to be different, oh
It isn't me, me, me

But I'm so scared of losin' all control
Don't you tell me it's better to let go
When the weight of the world feels so close
It's only me, me, me

Hard to sleep, could it be
Only me, only me
Hard to sleep, could it be
Only me, only me
Hard to sleep, could it be
Only me, only me
Hard to sleep, could it be
Only me, only me
Mm-mm, mm-hmm

I'm so scared of losin' all control
When they tell me it's better to let go
When the weight of the world feels so close
It's only me, me, me
And I'm so scared of losin' all control
When they tell me it's better to let go
When the weight of the world is so close
It's only me (Me), me (Me), me
It's only me, me, me

"Augusta"

Feel like maybe I might go to Boston
Cut my hair in the way that I've wanted
Change my number and bury my wallet
California makes me exhausted

I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost

Heard a poem about mid October
How the leaves in the fall feel like closure
About a girl that the guy wasn't over
Think that I might relate when I'm older

I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost

Tough I don't know a lot that could hurt me
Learned the hard way to forget my body
Till you're walking around like a zombie
Still don't know how to talk through that story

I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost

"Painkillers"

I almost liked the way you fooled me
To make me feel like this would last forever
But twice a night, I'd wake up sweating
To sleep without you here would do me better

I-I, I-I
Called you out and labeled you a problem
I-I, I-I
I should know that it takes one to know one

You represent the codependence
I was down, you wore the shining armor
The side-effect is cold resentment
Tricked me into thinking you were stronger

I-I, I-I
Called you out and knew you were my problem
I-I, I-I
I should know that it takes one to know one

Hold me slowly
You don't even know me
Home now, lights out
Pictures just destroy me
Come through late, and
Tell me that you want it bad
Hold me slowly
You don't even know me
Home now, lights out
Pictures just destroy me
Come through late, and
Tell me that you want it bad

"Alright"

I still avoid medication
I'd rather take a vacation
Drive around all of the outlets
Buy things and later regret it
Spend the whole week in Hawaii
Fall asleep under the palm trees
Down a whole bottle of whiskey
Countin' the people who hate me

I don't know if I'll be alright
What will it take to make this good
Oh, someone tell me it gets better
Better, better, better
Because for tonight, I'm just not alright

What if I drove to you backwards
Jump in the shallow end headfirst
Burn my emergency contact
Run for the hills when it gets bad
What if I never move out
I'd live in the basement my whole life
I got the chills when I said that
I never thought of a fallback

I don't know if I'll be alright (Alright)
What will it take to make this good
Oh, someone tell me it gets better
Better, better, better
Because for tonight, I'm just not alright

"Best"

I was bored out my mind
Lost my whole appetite
When I could come to life, I didn't
You were there all the time
You're the worst of my crimes
You fell hard
I thought good riddance

I never was the best to you
I never was the best to you
I never was
I never was

Used to lie to your face
Twenty times in a day
It was my little strange addiction
But you still tried to stay
While I'd self isolate
And I knew but I stayed hidden

I never was the best to you
I never was the best to you
I never was
I never was
I never was the best to you
I never was the best to you
I never was
I never was

And I destroyed every silver lining you had in your head
All of your feelings, I played with them
Go ahead, we can just call it conditioning
We were too different
You were so sensitive
Gave me the best of that, I was so negligent
Now I feel terrible about how I handled it

And now I
Now I bet you resent all of me, all of it
Angry, blocking me over the internet
Promise, I don't forget all of my fault in this
'Cause look at me, I'm alone, sitting here, staying home
All of my self control kinda got difficult
But I deserve it though
But I deserve it though

You were there all the time
You're the worst of my crimes
You fell hard
I thought good riddance

I never was the best to you
I never was the best to you
I never was
I never was
Oh, I never was the best to you
I never was the best to you
I never was
I never was

"I Know It Won't Work"

I left you here
Heard you keep the extra closet empty
In case this year
I come back and stay throughout my twenties
What if I won't
How am I supposed to put that gently
And down the road
You will love me until you resent me

I've had the thought
Tried to work it out through anxious pacing
What if I'm not
Worth the time and breath I know you're saving
But it's a lot
All the shine of half a decade fading
The whole facade
Seemed to fall apart, it's complicated

And part of me wants to walk away till you really listen
I hate to look at your face and know that we're feeling different
'Cause part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh
Why won't you try moving on for once That might make it easy
I know we cut all the ties but you're never really leaving
And part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh

I know it won't work like that

I'll open up
I'm thinking everything you wish I wasn't
The call was tough
But you're better off, I'm being honest
So won't you stop
Holding out for me when I don't want it
Just brush me off
'Cause I'm your ghost right now, your house is haunted

And part of me wants to walk away till you really listen
I hate to look at your face and know that we're feeling different
'Cause part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh
Why won't you try moving on for once That might make it easy
I know we cut all the ties but you're never really leaving
And part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh

I know it won't work like that, huh
I know it won't work like that, huh

And part of me wants to walk away till you really listen
I hate to look at your face and know that we're feeling different
'Cause part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh
Why won't you try moving on for once That might make it easy
I know we cut all the ties but you're never really leaving
And part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh

"Full Machine"

I'm a rollercoaster
You're a dead end street
But won't you stay for a while
I wish that you'd never leave

I know I know better
You're no guarantee
But if you asked me to run away
I'd go easily

I almost lost it
I'll heal eventually
But faster if you're next to me
Next to me
I'm codependent
But trying hard not to be
I'm better when you're next to me

I'm a shameless caller
You're a full machine
But won't you answer tonight
And say something nice to me
And you don't have to mean it

You can lie to me
But if you asked me to run away
I'd go easily

I almost lost it
I'll heal eventually
But faster if you're next to me
Next to me
I'm codependent
But trying hard not to be
I'm better when you're next to me, next to me

But do you think we could talk
'Cause I've been trying to tell you
How you're the one that I turn to

But I should probably stop
Instead of forcing a break through
It's just that I'll always choose you

I'm a forest fire
You're the kerosene
I had a life here before you
But now it's burning

I know I know better and
You're ignoring me
Still if you asked me to run away
I'd go easily

I almost lost it
I'll heal eventually
But faster if you're next to me
Next to me
I'm codependent
But I'm trying hard not to be
I'm better when you're next to me, next to me

Do you think we could talk
'Cause I've been trying to tell you
How you're the one that I turn to (Turn to)

But I should probably stop
Instead of forcing a break through
It's just that I'll always choose you

"Where Do We Go Now"

24th street
Where you held me, grabbed my arm
What a mental fire alarm
'Cause a lot of that felt wrong
Like I miss you
But when I kissed you back I lied
You don't know how hard I tried
Had to fake the longest time

Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now

You look hopeful
Like we're supposed to work somehow
Can't you tell our light burned out
Got a lot to cry about
There's nothing left here
All our best years are behind
What a brutal way to die
But you choose it every time

So, where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now

We could meet down the line
After all of the time and
Give an actual try
I can't promise you'll like it
I know I changed overnight
So I can't blame you for fighting
And I'd be losing my mind
If you lived in your writing

'Cause
Now I'm half of myself here without you
You're the best in my life and I lost you
And we had no control when it fell through
It was one-sided hate how I hurt you
If I could I'd have changed every feeling
Reservations were up to the ceiling
Guess the space was the thing that I needed
But I miss you

Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now
Where do we go now

"I Should Hate You"

Last night, I spiralled alone in the kitchen
Making pretend that the furniture listened
Wasn't the best of my mental conditions, but I tried
Thinkin' of you without any forgiveness

Because I was the one who would stay up and call you
And I'd drive to your house for the shit that you went through
Then I wasted my breath when I tried to console you, didn't I
'Cause we didn't happen the way we were supposed to

I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you

Pulled the knife out my back, it was right where you left it
But your aim's kinda perfect, I'll give you the credit
I just drank something strong to try to forget, but it wasn't right
No, you're not even here, but you're doin' my head in

I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
Ooh, ooh

I should hate you, I feel stupid
Like I almost crashed my car
Drivin' home to talk about you
At my table in the dark
All I ever think about is
Where the hell you even are
And I swear to God I'd kill you
If I loved you less hard

After all of this time, I still get disappointed
Bet you're doing alright and you don't even know it
How it's all 'cause of you that my standards are broken in my mind
I would bend back to you if you left the door open

I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
Ooh, ooh
I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
Ooh, ooh

"Will You Cry"

When you talk you get shallow
Where I walk you don't follow
When I scream you're my echo
Will you cry if I let go

Damage
Lined up
Wreckage left behind us
How'd we get stuck
Now I'm what you're bored of

Now you walk through me
With my heart heavy
Breaking my reverie
I could die early
With your arms 'round me
Habits go slowly
Would it not kill to say goodbye

When you talk you get shallow
Where I walk you don't follow
When I scream you're my echo
Will you cry if I let go

Pieces broken
All we left unspoken
Aimless hoping
Left my mouth wide open

It's kinda funny when it goes from all to nothing
You have to laugh before you start to cry
'Cause now I stop myself from holding on to something
That makes me feel a little less alive

When you talk you get shallow
Where I walk you don't follow
When I scream you're my echo
Will you cry if I let go

You don't move me
I see through you
I don't follow
I don't want to

You don't move me
I see through you
I don't follow
I don't want to

You don't move me
I see through you
I don't follow
I don't want to

You don't move me
I see through you
I don't follow
I don't want to

Now you walk through me
With my heart heavy
Breaking my reverie
I could die early
With your arms 'round me
Habits go slowly
Would it not kill to say goodbye

When you talk you get shallow
Where I walk you don't follow
When I scream you're my echo
Will you cry if I let go

When you talk you get shallow
Where I walk you don't follow
When I scream you're my echo
Will you cry if I let go

Will you cry if I let go

Will you cry if I let go

Will you cry if I let go

Will you cry if I let go

"Amelie"

I met a girl once
She sort of ripped me open
She doesn't even know it
She doesn't know my name
We sat on the sofa
She asked me a million questions
I answered and by eleven
Memorized her face

Where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie
Where'd you go
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie
I don't know

Why'd it feel louder
When all of it went unspoken
All I can do is hope that
This will go away
She had her hair up
She cried about her obsessions
But she doesn't know I'd let her
Ruin all my days

Where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie
Where'd you go
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie
I don't know
Where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie
Where'd you go
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie
Tell me no

Tell me more, I would give all my time
All your words felt like a nursery rhyme
Comfortable, handing you my whole life
When all your words felt like a funeral rite

So where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie
Where'd you go
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie
I don't know, oh
Where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie
Where'd you go
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie
I don't know

So where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie
Where'd you go
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie
I don't know, oh
Where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie
Where'd you go
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie
Tell me no

"Difficult"

My double vision
Is only amplifying everything he isn't
Till I feel less attached and bored to death but listen
It's no one's fault, it's just my terrible condition

And I've been thinking if I move out this year
I'll feel my parents slipping
Away and also I'm just scared of that commitment
I really think sometimes there's something that I'm missing

Oh I know spiraling is miserable
I should probably go back home
Why does that feel difficult, difficult
Oh I hope I wake up invisible
I'd be someone no one knows
I guess I'm just difficult

To name this feeling
Would take a hundred thousand years, some kind of grieving
But over what I never had, so I've been speaking
To my therapist, I call her every weekend

I meant to tell you
How I've hated how we left things when it fell through
'Cause you were everything to me, where did you run to
Was it something that I said that colored you blue

Oh I know spiraling is miserable
I should probably go back home
Why does that feel difficult, difficult
Oh I hope I wake up invisible
I'd be someone no one knows
I guess I'm just difficult, difficult

Difficult
Difficult

I've been drinking
And staying up too late reliving bad decisions
I thought eventually my ranting here would fix it
I really think sometimes there's something that I'm missing

Oh I know spiraling is miserable
I should probably go back home
Why does that feel difficult, difficult
Oh I hope I wake up invisible
I'd be someone no one knows
I guess I'm just difficult, difficult

Oh I know spiraling is miserable
I should probably go back home
Why does that feel difficult, difficult
Oh I hope I wake up invisible
I'd be someone no one knows
I guess I'm just difficult, difficult

"This Is What The Drugs Are For"

This is what the drugs are for
Turn the lights off on the come down
I still get emotional
When I think about your old house

Hopefully, the high
Works to change my mind

Now, I feel you in my room
Haven't seen you in a lifetime
What am I supposed to do
When you used to be my lifeline

I've counted all the days
Since you walked away

Look now I'm alone again
I've gotten used to sleeping here without you
Though I've tried I can't pretend
That I don't sit around and think about you
When all I ever do is think about you

In the middle of the night
I got caught inside a fever
Almost called a hundred times
Just to ask if you might leave her

She appears in dreams
Chasing after me

Look now I'm alone again
I've gotten used to sleeping here without you
Though I've tried I can't pretend
That I don't sit around and think about you

Look how I just lost a friend
I'm burying your things inside my bedroom
All distractions in the end
Don't work, I'm left to sit and think about you
Like all I ever do is think about you

I'm still waiting by the phone
You painted my life indigo
A kind of blue I hate to know
Where everything turns kind of cold

Look now I'm alone again
I've gotten used to sleeping here without you
Though I've tried I can't pretend
That I don't sit around and think about you

Look how I just lost a friend
I'm burying your things inside my bedroom
All distractions in the end
Don't work, I'm left to sit and think about you
Like all I ever do is think about you

"Fault Line"

You could go, and I won't even feel it
Wouldn't hold up the road when you're leaving
You're a bad holiday
You're the drug that I take
When I want to forget how I'm feeling

I know you're a fault line
But I'll break too
Cracking at the same time
Does it shock you

When I'm down
I fall right back to you, it happens
I know you're a fault line
But I'll break too
I'll break too

You could go, and I bet I'd recover
Overnight, finish hurting each other
You feel light years away
If I met you today
I would run to the arms of another

I know you're a fault line
But I'll break too
Cracking at the same time
Does it shock you

When I'm down
I fall back in to you, it happens
I know you're a fault line
But I'll break too
I'll break too

And all my imaginary friends are scared of you
I've gone and cried to them in our bedroom
Most nights I will pretend
I left this sooner

But I know you're a fault line
But I'll break too
Cracking at the same time
Does it shock you

When I'm down
I fall back in to you, it happens
I know you're a fault line
But I'll break too

I'll break too
I'll break too
I'd break too

"The Blue"

You live in Hollywood
You're half an hour from me
Your reputation's good
I hope we've got a lot in common

I kinda think you should
Just drop it all and call me
You'd tell me on the phone
You really want to meet my family

What are you doing to me now
What are you doing to me now

You'd talk about your dad
He used to get so angry
He'd scare you and your brother
Till you felt you needed saving

I know I'd let you in
On all my bad decisions
You'd make them feel less terrible
The second that you'd listen

What are you doing to me now
What are you doing to me now

You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted

You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted

I wonder if you know
If you can tell I'm losing
I'm going down without a fight
I don't know how you do it

You say we share a brain
Apologizing for it
But I take it as a compliment
You make me really nervous

What are you doing to me now
What are you doing to me now

You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted

You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted

What are you doing to me now
What are you doing to me
What are you doing to me now
Mmm, mmm

Send me every song
That keeps you up from sleeping
I bet I could recite 'em all
I won't forget the feeling

Of staying up with you
Despite the space between us
I've never felt this close to someone
What if you're my weakness

You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted

You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted

You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted

You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted

"Right Now"

Look at me, I feel homesick
Want my dog in the door
And the light in the kitchen
From the fridge, on the floor
And the faint overhearing
Of my mom on the phone
Through the walls of my bedroom
Things that I shouldn't know

Think the bus might be broken
'Cause the shocks never work
We're collectively hoping
That the drive will be short

People 247
It's the best and a curse
All they do is remind me
That I'm still introverted

I'm so high, but can't look down
Left my past life on the ground
Think I'm more alive somehow
I feel like myself right now

Pretty far from the ocean
Never thought that would hurt
Every lake here is frozen
Which is making it worse

This is somebody's hometown
Never been here before
Writing down every street sign
Missed the spelling, I'm sure

And I ended a friendship
On the day that I left
And though I really meant it
It still makes me upset

Am I losing my family
Every minute I'm gone
What if my little brother
Thinks my leaving was wrong

Oh, oh, I'm so high, but can't look down
Left my past life on the ground
Think I'm more alive somehow
I feel like myself right now

I'm so tired, but can't sit down
What if this is it for now
Think I'm more alive somehow
I feel like myself right now

I feel like myself right now
I feel like myself right now
I feel like myself right now
Mmmm

"Block Me Out"

I'll say whatever you want, but I've become such a liar
I used to follow my gut, but now I'm just getting higher
It's been a couple of months since I turned to something violent
I should be happier now, so why do I feel this quiet

Now I only let me down
When there's no one else around
I've been thinking way too loud
I wish that I could block me out

I wish that I could block me out
Out

I think I'm burning alive, but nobody sees the fire
'Cause when I open my mouth, I seem to be stuck in silence
I thought of leaving tonight, but I couldn't drive this tired
Plus after all of this time, I should be a pretty crier

And now I only let me down
When there's no one else around
I've been thinking way too loud
I wish that I could block me out
Don't know how they see me now
Feeling lost in every crowd
I feel ten feet off the ground
I wish that I could block me out

And in my head, I make a mess of it
I'm getting tired of feeling delicate
I look around, to find it desolate
I used to try, but nothing's helping it
And in my head, I make a mess of it
I'm getting tired of feeling delicate
I look around, to find it desolate
I used to try, but nothing's helping it

Wish I were heavier now I'm floating outside my body
It's not their fault, but I've found that none of my friends will call me
Until I'm left to myself, it's honestly kind of funny
How every voice in my head is trying its best to haunt me

'Cause now I only let me down
When there's no one else around
I've been thinking way too loud
I wish that I could block me out
Don't know how they see me now
Feeling lost in every crowd
I feel ten feet off the ground
I wish that I could block me out
Out

I wish that I could block me out
I wish that I could block me out

"Unsteady"

Hiding
I kinda feel like an island
I should go home
But I'm fighting that right now
People freak me out
And I panic
I should be cool but I panic
Out of the blue
And I end up on the ground
Weaker all around

But it's so hard
When it feels like my fault
When I keep 'em so far
Happens when I go dark
I'm so unsteady
It's so hard
When it feels like my fault
When I keep 'em so far
Happens when I go dark
I'm so unsteady

Deeper
Words seem to cut so much deeper
Right to the bone
And I let 'em break me down
Someone pull me out right now
And I'm in danger
The girl in the mirror is a stranger
At all of the parties
I talk but there's no sound
Violet shrinking down

And it's so hard
When it feels like my fault
When I keep 'em so far
Happens when I go dark
I'm so unsteady
It's so hard
When it feels like my fault
When I keep 'em so far
Happens when I go dark
I'm so unsteady

Lately I've been staring at the ceiling
It's a sort of funny quiet feeling
Lately I don't know what to believe in
None of this is changing with the seasons

Hiding
I kinda feel like an island
I should go home
But I'm fighting that right now
People freak me out

But it's so hard
When it feels like my fault
When I keep 'em so far
Happens when I get dark
I'm so unsteady
It's so hard
When it feels like my fault
When I keep 'em so far
Happens when I go dark
I'm so unsteady

I'm so unsteady
I'm so unsteady
I'm so un-
I'm so unsteady

"405"

I, I took the 405
I drove 100 miles an hour to forget you
And I blew through the traffic light
If I were to go tonight, I think I would regret you

You took the half of me that I needed
And how'd you walk away so easy
It's almost like you like to let me down
You took half of me, could you leave it
And go back to when we were speaking
I hate the fact that I miss you around

Please, you won't even look at me
It's getting embarrassing, I'm crying to my family
And now I'm, I'm harder to recognize 'cause
I cut all my hair last night while you think of me barely

You took the half of me that I needed
And how'd you walk away so easy
It's almost like you like to let me down
You took the half of me, could you leave it
And go back to when we were speaking
I hate the fact that I miss you around

Tell me why
How the hell I slipped your mind
You forgot me overnight
Didn't even try to hide it
All the while, lost my head and appetite
You've consumed, like, all my nights
Now I know it's unrequited

'Cause I, I took the 405
I drove 100 miles an hour to forget you

You took the half of me that I needed
And how'd you walk away so easy
It's almost like you like to let me down, down
You took half of me, could you leave it
And go back to when we were speaking
I hate the fact that I miss you around

"Two People"

Turn around, why are you talking so slowly
Why's it feel like you don't even know me
How are you looking at me like a stranger
I'm the radar for every deal breaker

I loved you so hard for a time
I've tried to ration it out all my life
We could go yellow to black overnight
I take you for granted because you are mine

Don't know what to say
Two people can change
Don't think we're above
Might happen to us
Oh, isn't it strange
We'll die anyway
Don't think we're above
Might happen to us
Mmm

Now to make sense of half of a decade
Feels like walking alone on the freeway
'Cause you know everything that could kill me
And you know, you know every inch of my body

I loved you so hard for a time
So why am I clawing you to survive
Hate how we touch just to push things aside
When you take me for granted, I make it alright

Don't know what to say
Two people can change
Don't think we're above
Might happen to us
Oh, isn't it strange
We'll die anyway
Don't think we're above
Might happen to us

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm

Don't know what to say
Two people can change
Don't think we're above
Might happen to us
Isn't it strange
We'll die anyway
Don't think we're above
Might happen to us
Mmm

"Abby (Demo)"

Climb up the ivy, come through the window
Hide from your family, here with your face close
Tell on your brother, how he's been so cold
I'll make you dinner, put on your headphones
Tune out the bad news, letters from college
You miss your best friend, she should be calling
Just fall asleep right here on the carpet
I'd never wake you, stay 'til the morning light

I'm right here, fall to me, to me
Fill your head with sweet dreams, sweet dreams
You'd never hurt a thing, nothing
I hope you know to talk to me

When we were little, we shared a haircut
Wanted to kill you, I was embarrassed
Mothers insisted that we would grow up
And things would be different 'cause we would be closer
Tell me your secrets, ask every question
My door is open 247
Think you were made from something in heaven
You made me love the number 11

I'm right here, fall to me, to me
Fill your head with sweet dreams, sweet dreams
You'd never hurt a thing, nothing
I hope you know to talk to me

I was just thinking, do you remember
Going to New York back in November
Swallowing chocolate, sharing a king bed
Judging an album, judging my boyfriend
Isn't it funny, we're getting older
You used to fit right up on my shoulders
I can't believe our childhood is over
I'm really grateful I get to know you

I'm right here, fall to me, to me
Fill your head with sweet dreams, sweet dreams
You'd never hurt a thing, nothing
I hope you know to talk to me

I'm right here, fall to me, to me
Fill your head with sweet dreams, sweet dreams
You'd never hurt a thing, nothing
I hope you know to talk to me

"Brush Fire"

Started as a simple lie
Thinking love had chose us
We would talk into the night
And nobody noticed

And I held on to every word
Couldn't let you go and called it hope
Now I'm so low, I can't ignore
We only ever made it worse

Then we become a brush fire, burning all the pain
How can we survive a desert without rain
And all along your promise is that you're changing
Boy, you know what to say before I turn away
Your words hit me like a hard rain in LA

Scared to turn and look behind
Think I'd see you hurting
And even when I close my eyes
I feel like the burden

But I'm not yours anymore
Everything you broke is ash and smoke now
I'm so low, I can't ignore
We only ever made it worse

Then we become a brush fire, burning all the pain
How can we survive a desert without rain
And all along your promise is that you're changing
Boy, you know what to say before I turn away
Your words hit me like a hard rain in LA

Then we become a brush fire, burning all the pain
How can we survive a desert without rain
And all along your promise is that you're changing
Boy, you know what to say before I turn away
Your words hit me like a hard rain in LA

"Cedar"
(from "The Buccaneers Season 1" soundtrack)

It's been good to know ya
This goodbye felt worst of all
No defining closure
No instruction manual
If you thought to call me
I would answer every time
Breaking up is funny
I forget you aren't mine

I forget you aren't mine
I forget you aren't mine
I forget you aren't mine

It's impossible to acclimate
Every time we talk, we understate
Oh, I know we both could die
We both could die
But you told me that you felt the same
When I told you how I needed space
But I think it was a lie
It was a lie

It's been tough to leave you
Every empty Sunday night
You come back in pieces
Every detail amplified
If you think to write me
It'll go internalized
Breaking up is funny
I forget you aren't mine

I forget you aren't mine

It's impossible to acclimate
Every time we talk, we understate
Oh, I know we both could die
We both could die
But you told me that you felt the same
When I told you how I needed space
But I think it was a lie
It was a lie

And it's wild how it dissipates
How you're further from me every day
This could be the worst goodbye
The worst goodbye
I don't even know what's left to say
'Cause we called it back then anyway
Could you just remind me why
Remind me why

It's been weird to miss you
Hits me at the strangest times
Seven years would cut through
Other people like a knife
If I tried to meet you
Couldn't look you in the eye
Breaking up is funny
I forget you aren't mine

I forget you aren't mine

"Delusional"

Look at me now
Said I wouldn't do it, but I hunted you down
Know you had a girl, but it didn't work out
Know you bought a house, but you had to move out
I'm not proud, 'cause I'm just scared of you shootin' it down
You can just talk and I'll stare at your mouth
It could be bad, but I won't find out

And I wake up, in the middle of the night
With the light on
I feel like I could die
'Cause you're not here
And it don't feel right
'Cause you're not here

God, I'm actually invested
Haven't even met him
Watch this be the wrong thing, classic
God, I'm jumping in the deep end
It's more fun to swim, and
Heard the risk is drowning, but I'm gonna take it
I'm gonna take it
Oh whoa, oh whoa

Isn't it fun thinkin' I'm right when I'm probably wrong
Holding my breath, livin' in slowmo
Knowing damn well that I haven't been touched by you
Behind you in the club, you're coming to me
You get to my door, and you can't even speak
But I think that it's sweet, yeah I think that you're sweet

And I wake up, in the middle of the night
With the light on
And you're not here

God, I'm actually invested
Haven't even met him
Watch this be the wrong thing, classic
God, I'm
Jumpin' in the deep end
It's more fun to swim and
Heard the risk is drowning, but I'm gonna take it

I'm gonna bend 'til I break and
You'll be my favorite mistake
I wish you would hold me, you're shakin'
You're the risk, I'm gonna take it
Why aren't you here in my bedroom
Hopelessly boring without you
Too soon to tell you, I love you
Kiss you and tell you I love you

God, I'm actually invested
Think I really want this
I'm not even kidding
No, I'm actually invested
Haven't even met yet
Wish that I was kidding, I'm not and
I hate it
God, I'm actually invested
Haven't even met him
Watch this be the wrong thing, classic
God, I'm jumping in the deep end
It's more fun to swim and
Heard the risk is drowning, but I'm gonna take it
Whoa-oh-oh
I'm gonna take it
Heard the risk is drowning, but I'm gonna take it

Too soon to tell you I love you
Too soon to tell you I love you
Too soon to tell you I love you
You're the risk, I'm gonna take it

"Mean It"

Talk to me more
You're a little bit bored, I'm a little bit tired
We don't fight though
You've been acting so cold, I don't know what you wanted

Every time we touch it's like the last time
Holding onto something when it's not right
Tell me to my face that you are all mine
You don't know what I'm feeling

Maybe that thing you said under your breath, you mean it
Holding on to thin lines till we just walk between 'em
Getting so loud, I can't pretend that I don't hear 'em
Maybe that thing you said under your breath, you mean it
I know you mean it

Do we let go
Are we too far gone I don't know what we started
I guess I don't know
Where we took a wrong turn, everything got harder

Every time we touch it's like the last time
Holding onto something when it's not right
Tell me to my face that you are all mine
You don't know what I'm feeling

Maybe that thing you said under your breath, you mean it
Holding on to thin lines till we just walk between 'em
Getting so loud, I can't pretend that I don't hear 'em
Maybe that thing you said under your breath, you mean it
I know you mean it
I know you mean it
I know you mean it
I know you mean it

"Mess It Up"

Open to double doors
Typical, pretty sure I could grow up
Probably chemical
I took up walking to turn it all off
Doesn't feel bearable
Guess I thought when I left it would all stop
It would all stop

Did I fall out of line when I called you
When I told you I'm fine you were lied to
How could I think that all that I gave you was enough
'Cause every time I get too close I just go mess it up

Funny that didn't work
I could be anywhere
I'm on your block
Cynical
Terrible
Kicking myself with my gut in a knot
'Cause I heard that you're happier
Hope that you're sleeping well, knowing I'm not
I'm doing too much

Did I fall out of line when I called you
When I told you I'm fine, you were lied to
How could I think that all that I gave you was enough
'Cause every time I get too close I just go mess it up

I keep thinking maybe if you let me back in
We could make it better, breaking every habit
Pull myself together
You could watch it happen
Let it happen
Let it happen

I keep thinking maybe if you let me back in
We could make it better, breaking every habit
Pull myself together
You could watch it happen
Let it happen
Let it happen

I keep thinking maybe if you let me back in
We could make it better, breaking every habit
Pull myself together
You could watch it happen
Let it happen
Let it happen

I keep thinking maybe if you let me back in
We could make it better, breaking every habit
Pull myself together
You could watch it happen
Let it happen
Let it happen

"Spark"

I heard a spark, something that glowed hundred feet higher
I opened my eyes when there is light to see if I'm closer
What if I stopped just for a while to make it go slower
Still up the night, just for a while to see if I'm finer, live like I'm finer

Tell me a tale, something with fire to break from the sorrow
To break through the dirt, piles of earth, to see where the sun goes
What if I stopped just for a while to see if I'm closer
Still up the night, just for a while to see where the sun goes

I heard a spark, something that glowed hundred feet higher
I opened my eyes when there is light to see if I'm closer
What if I stopped just for a while to see where the sun goes
Still half the night, just for a while to see if I'm finer, live like I'm finer

"Stay"

You told me something when I left but I don't remember
Maybe 'cause all I could do then was stare at the floor
I held myself 'cause you wouldn't, all wrapped in my sweatshirt
Wonder if you even noticed that that one was yours

And maybe I should've but I never told you I'm sorry
Know that I tried but my words always got in the way

Could you hold me without any talking
We could try to go back where we started
I don't even have to stay
I don't even have to stay but

If I woke up with you in the morning
I'd forget all the ways that we're broken
I don't care if you've changed
I don't even have to stay

I don't remember the last time I heard from your sister
Didn't expect to but I sort of thought that I would
Wish I could tell you by now that I felt more indifferent
Catch myself thinking about you more than I should

And maybe I should have but I never told you I miss you
I almost said it but don't know if you feel the same

Could you hold me without any talking
We could try to go back where we started
I don't even have to stay
I don't even have to stay but

If I woke up with you in the morning
I'd forget all the ways that we're broken
I don't care if you've changed
I don't even have to stay

"You Aren't Mine (Demo)"

It's been good to know you
This goodbye felt worst of all
No defining closure
No instruction manual
If you thought to call me
I would answer every time
Breaking up is funny
I forget you aren't mine

I forget you aren't mine
I forget you aren't mine
I forget you aren't mine

It's impossible to acclimate
Every time we talk we understate
How I know we both could die, we both could die

How you're further from me everyday
This could be the worst goodbye, the worst goodbye
I don't even know what's left to say

"Suzanne"

Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river 
You can hear the boats go by 
You can spend the night beside her 
And you know that she's half crazy 
But that's why you want to be there 
And she feeds you tea and oranges 
That come all the way from China 
And just when you mean to tell her 
That you have no love to give her 
Then she gets you on her wavelength 
And she lets the river answer 
That you've always been her lover 
And you want to travel with her 
And you want to travel blind 
And you know that she will trust you 
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind. 
And Jesus was a sailor 
When he walked upon the water 
And he spent a long time watching 
From his lonely wooden tower 
And when he knew for certain 
Only drowning men could see him 
He said "All men will be sailors then 
Until the sea shall free them" 
But he himself was broken 
Long before the sky would open 
Forsaken, almost human 
He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone 
And you want to travel with him 
And you want to travel blind 
And you think maybe you'll trust him 
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind. 

Now Suzanne takes your hand 
And she leads you to the river 
She is wearing rags and feathers 
From Salvation Army counters 
And the sun pours down like honey 
On our lady of the harbour 
And she shows you where to look 
Among the garbage and the flowers 
There are heroes in the seaweed 
There are children in the morning 
They are leaning out for love 
And they will lean that way forever 
While Suzanne holds the mirror 
And you want to travel with her 
And you want to travel blind 
And you know that you can trust her 
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind.

"Master Song"

I believe that you heard your master sing 
when I was sick in bed. 
I suppose that he told you everything 
that I keep locked away in my head. 
Your master took you travelling, 
well at least that's what you said. 
And now do you come back to bring 
your prisoner wine and bread 
You met him at some temple, where 
they take your clothes at the door. 
He was just a numberless man in a chair 
who'd just come back from the war. 
And you wrap up his tired face in your hair 
and he hands you the apple core. 
Then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare 
of all the kisses we put on some time before. 

And he gave you a German Shepherd to walk 
with a collar of leather and nails, 
and he never once made you explain or talk 
about all of the little details, 
such as who had a word and who had a rock, 
and who had you through the mails. 
Now your love is a secret all over the block, 
and it never stops not even when your master fails. 

And he took you up in his aeroplane, 
which he flew without any hands, 
and you cruised above the ribbons of rain 
that drove the crowd from the stands. 
Then he killed the lights in a lonely Lane 
and, an ape with angel glands, 
erased the final wisps of pain 
with the music of rubber bands. 

And now I hear your master sing, 
you kneel for him to come. 
His body is a golden string 
that your body is hanging from. 
His body is a golden string, 
my body has grown numb. 
Oh now you hear your master sing, 
your shirt is all undone. 

And will you kneel beside this bed 
that we polished so long ago, 
before your master chose instead 
to make my bed of snow 
Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red 
and you're speaking far too low. 
No I can't make out what your master said 
before he made you go. 

Then I think you're playing far too rough 
for a lady who's been to the moon 
I've lain by this window long enough 
to get used to an empty room. 
And your love is some dust in an old man's cough 
who is tapping his foot to a tune, 
and your thighs are a ruin, you want too much, 
let's say you came back some time too soon. 

I loved your master perfectly 
I taught him all that he knew. 
He was starving in some deep mystery 
like a man who is sure what is true. 
And I sent you to him with my guarantee 
I could teach him something new, 
and I taught him how you would long for me 
no matter what he said no matter what you'd do. 

I believe that you heard your master sing 
while I was sick in bed, 
I'm sure that he told you everything 
I must keep locked away in my head. 
Your master took you travelling, 
well at least that's what you said, 
And now do you come back to bring 
your prisoner wine and bread

"Winter Lady"

Trav'ling lady, stay awhile 
until the night is over. 
I'm just a station on your way, 
I know I'm not your lover. 
Well I lived with a child of snow 
when I was a soldier, 
and I fought every man for her 
until the nights grew colder. 

She used to wear her hair like you 
except when she was sleeping, 
and then she'd weave it on a loom 
of smoke and gold and breathing. 

And why are you so quiet now 
standing there in the doorway 
You chose your journey long before 
you came upon this highway. 

Trav'ling lady stay awhile 
until the night is over. 
I'm just a station on your way, 
I know I'm not your lover.

"Stranger Song"

It's true that all the men you knew were dealers
Who said they were through with dealing
Every time you gave them shelter
I know that kind of man
It's hard to hold the hand of anyone
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender
Who is reaching for the sky just to surrender

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much
Not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card
That is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger

And then leaning on your window sill
He'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet
An old schedule of trains, he'll say
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger

But now another stranger seems
To want you to ignore his dreams
As though they were the burden of some other
Oh, you've seen that man before
His golden arm dispatching cards
But now it's rusted from the elbow to the finger
And he wants to trade the game he plays for shelter
Yes, he wants to trade the game he knows for shelter

Ah, you hate to watch another tired man
Lay down his hand
Like he was giving up the holy game of poker
And while he talks his dreams to sleep
You notice there's a highway
That is curling up like smoke above his shoulder
It's curling just like smoke above his shoulder

You tell him to come in, sit down
But something makes you turn around
The door is open, you can't close your shelter
You try the handle of the road
It opens, do not be afraid
It's you my love, you who are the stranger
It is you my love, you who are the stranger

Well, I've been waiting, I was sure
We'd meet between the trains we're waiting for
I think it's time to board another
Please understand, I never had a secret chart
To get me to the heart of this
Or any other matter
While he talks like this, you don't know what he's after
When he speaks like this, you don't know what he's after

Let's meet tomorrow if you choose
Upon the shore, beneath the bridge
That they are building on some endless river
Then he leaves the platform
For the sleeping car that's warm
You realize, he's only advertising one more shelter
And it comes to you, he never was a stranger
And you say, "OK, the bridge or some place later."

And then sweeping up the jokers that he left behind
You find he did not leave you very much
Not even laughter
Like any dealer he was watching for the card
That is so high and wild
He'll never need to deal another
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger
He was just some Joseph looking for a manger

And leaning on your window sill
He'll say one day you caused his will
To weaken with your love and warmth and shelter
And then taking from his wallet
An old schedule of trains, he'll say
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger
I told you when I came I was a stranger

"Sisters Of Mercy"

Oh the sisters of mercy, they are not departed or gone. 
They were waiting for me when I thought that I just can't go on. 
And they brought me their comfort and later they brought me this song. 
Oh I hope you run into them, you who've been travelling so long. 
Yes you who must leave everything that you cannot control. 
It begins with your family, but soon it comes around to your soul. 
Well I've been where you're hanging, I think I can see how you're pinned 
When you're not feeling holy, your loneliness says that you've sinned. 

Well they lay down beside me, I made my confession to them. 
They touched both my eyes and I touched the dew on their hem. 
If your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn 
they will bind you with love that is graceful and green as a stem. 

When I left they were sleeping, I hope you run into them soon. 
Don't turn on the lights, you can read their address by the moon. 
And you won't make me jealous if I hear that they sweetened your night 
We weren't lovers like that and besides it would still be all right, 
We weren't lovers like that and besides it would still be all right.

"So Long Marianne"

Come over to the window, my little darling, 
I'd like to try to read your palm. 
I used to think I was some kind of Gypsy boy 
before I let you take me home. 
Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began 
to laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again. 

Well you know that I love to live with you, 
but you make me forget so very much. 
I forget to pray for the angels 
and then the angels forget to pray for us. 

Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ... 

We met when we were almost young 
deep in the green lilac park. 
You held on to me like I was a crucifix, 
as we went kneeling through the dark. 

Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ... 

Your letters they all say that you're beside me now. 
Then why do I feel alone 
I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web 
is fastening my ankle to a stone. 

Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ... 

For now I need your hidden love. 
I'm cold as a new razor blade. 
You left when I told you I was curious, 
I never said that I was brave. 

Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ... 

Oh, you are really such a pretty one. 
I see you've gone and changed your name again. 
And just when I climbed this whole mountainside, 
to wash my eyelids in the rain 

Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began ...

"Hey, That's No Way To Say Goodbye"

I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm, 
your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm, 
yes, many loved before us, I know that we are not new, 
in city and in forest they smiled like me and you, 
but now it's come to distances and both of us must try, 
your eyes are soft with sorrow, 
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye. 
I'm not looking for another as I wander in my time, 
walk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme 
you know my love goes with you as your love stays with me, 
it's just the way it changes, like the shoreline and the sea, 
but let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie, 
your eyes are soft with sorrow, 
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye. 

I loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm, 
your hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm,

your eyes are soft with sorrow, 
Hey, that's no way to say goodbye.

"Stories Of The Street"

The stories of the street are mine,the Spanish voices laugh. 
The Cadillacs go creeping now through the night and the poison gas, 
and I lean from my window sill in this old hotel I chose, 
yes one hand on my suicide, one hand on the rose. 
I know you've heard it's over now and war must surely come, 
the cities they are broke in half and the middle men are gone. 
But let me ask you one more time, O children of the dusk, 
All these hunters who are shrieking now oh do they speak for us 

And where do all these highways go, now that we are free 
Why are the armies marching still that were coming home to me 
O lady with your legs so fine O stranger at your wheel, 
You are locked into your suffering and your pleasures are the seal. 

The age of lust is giving birth, and both the parents ask 
the nurse to tell them fairy tales on both sides of the glass. 
And now the infant with his cord is hauled in like a kite, 
and one eye filled with blueprints, one eye filled with night. 

O come with me my little one, we will find that farm 
and grow us grass and apples there and keep all the animals warm. 
And if by chance I wake at night and I ask you who I am, 
O take me to the slaughterhouse, I will wait there with the lamb. 

With one hand on the hexagram and one hand on the girl 
I balance on a wishing well that all men call the world. 
We are so small between the stars, so large against the sky, 
and lost among the subway crowds I try to catch your eye.

"Teachers"

I met a woman long ago 
her hair the black that black can go, 
Are you a teacher of the heart 
Soft she answered no. 
I met a girl across the sea, 
her hair the gold that gold can be, 
Are you a teacher of the heart 
Yes, but not for thee. 

I met a man who lost his mind 
in some lost place I had to find, 
follow me the wise man said, 
but he walked behind. 

I walked into a hospital 
where none was sick and none was well, 
when at night the nurses left 
I could not walk at all. 

Morning came and then came noon, 
dinner time a scalpel blade 
lay beside my silver spoon. 

Some girls wander by mistake 
into the mess that scalpels make. 
Are you the teachers of my heart 
We teach old hearts to break. 

One morning I woke up alone, 
the hospital and the nurses gone. 
Have I carved enough my Lord 
Child, you are a bone. 

I ate and ate and ate, 
no I did not miss a plate, well 
How much do these suppers cost 
We'll take it out in hate. 

I spent my hatred everyplace, 
on every work on every face, 
someone gave me wishes 
and I wished for an embrace. 

Several girls embraced me, then 
I was embraced by men, 
Is my passion perfect 
No, do it once again. 

I was handsome I was strong, 
I knew the words of every song. 
Did my singing please you 
No, the words you sang were wrong. 

Who is it whom I address, 
who takes down what I confess 
Are you the teachers of my heart 
We teach old hearts to rest. 

Oh teachers are my lessons done 
I cannot do another one. 
They laughed and laughed and said, Well child, 
are your lessons done 
are your lessons done 
are your lessons done

"One Of Us Cannot Be Wrong"

I lit a thin green candle, to make you jealous of me. 
But the room just filled up with mosquitos, 
they heard that my body was free. 
Then I took the dust of a long sleepless night 
and I put it in your little shoe. 
And then I confess that I tortured the dress 
that you wore for the world to look through. 
I showed my heart to the doctor he said I just have to quit. 
Then he wrote himself a prescription, 
and your name was mentioned in it 
Then he locked himself in a library shelf 
with the details of our honeymoon, 
and I hear from the nurse that he's gotten much worse 
and his practice is all in a ruin. 

I heard of a saint who had loved you, 
so I studied all night in his school. 
He taught that the duty of lovers 
is to tarnish the golden rule. 
And just when I was sure that his teachings were pure 
he drowned himself in the pool. 
His body is gone but back here on the lawn 
his spirit continues to drool. 

An Eskimo showed me a movie 
he'd recently taken of you 
the poor man could hardly stop shivering, 
his lips and his fingers were blue. 
I suppose that he froze when the wind took your clothes 
and I guess he just never got warm. 
But you stand there so nice, in your blizzard of ice, 
oh please let me come into the storm.

"Store Room"

It's not the wind that keeps you up, it's not the snow
It's not the moon coming like a headlight through your window
It's not the thumbnail of a screen that scrapes away your dream
It's just this man taking what he needs from the store room

It's not the news of burning towns that ruins your mind
Like a spool you turn and you turn but it won't unwind
No these wars you did not start, they don't tear your sleep apart
It's just a man taking what he needs from the store room

And now this woman by your side, well, she's asleep
And there's nothing you can give her and there's nothing you want to keep
You don't even try to prove that the noise is neighbors making love
It's just a man taking what he needs from the store room

Well go to sleep and change the locks when you wake up
Share your toast, maybe spill some coffee from your cup
Oh, there's nothing left to choose and there is so much more to lose
There's this man taking what he needs from the store room

It's not the wind that keeps you up, it's not the snow
It's not the moon coming like a headlight through your window
It's not the thumbnail of a screen that scrapes away your dream
It's just a man taking what he needs from the store room

It's not the news of burning towns that ruins your mind
Like a spool you turn and turn but won't unwind
No these wars you did not start, they don't tear your sleep apart
It's just a man taking what he needs from the store room

And now the woman by your side, well, she's awake
But there's nothing you can give her and there's nothing you want to take
You don't even try to prove that the noise is neighbors making love
It's just a man taking what he needs from the store room

Or go to sleep and change the locks when you wake up
Share your toast, maybe spill a little coffee from your cup
He's got nothing left to choose and you've got so much more to lose
There's just a man taking what he needs from the store room

It's not the wind

"Blessed Is The Memory"

I remember the promise
That you made in the barn
When the kittens were born
And you could not keep warm

So you moved away the mountain
That the sun rose behind
And you said yourself a prayer
And laid down with the blind

But you lost them in your freedom
And you need him now, you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

And the vow of compassion
That you swore through your teeth
When the war began to end
And the photographs weep

Well, nobody blames you
As the train pulls away
With its cargo of snow
For these German paper-weights

But you lost them in your freedom
And you need him now, you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

Well, its five in the morning
There's no one at home
Except for your wife
And your child on the phone

Somebody's got to listen
To a promise or two
Oh, this room is far too small
For a pilgrim like you

But you lost them in your freedom
And you need him now, you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

So, now that you've decided
To follow the sun
Like a shadow of birds
Or a king on the run

Oh, your chains are too dark
For the seas you must swim
You are smiling at the seaweed
But your smile is too grim

But you lost them in your freedom
And you need him now, you're wild
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child
Blessed is the memory
Of everybody's child

"Bird On The Wire"

Like a bird on the wire, 
like a drunk in a midnight choir 
I have tried in my way to be free. 
Like a worm on a hook, 
like a knight from some old fashioned book 
I have saved all my ribbons for thee. 
If I, if I have been unkind, 
I hope that you can just let it go by. 
If I, if I have been untrue 
I hope you know it was never to you. 
Like a baby, stillborn, 
like a beast with his horn 
I have torn everyone who reached out for me. 
But I swear by this song 
and by all that I have done wrong 
I will make it all up to thee. 
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch, 
he said to me, "You must not ask for so much." 
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door, 
she cried to me, "Hey, why not ask for more" 

Oh like a bird on the wire, 
like a drunk in a midnight choir 
I have tried in my way to be free.

"Story Of Isaac"

The door it opened slowly, 
my father he came in, 
I was nine years old. 
And he stood so tall above me, 
his blue eyes they were shining 
and his voice was very cold. 
He said, "I've had a vision 
and you know I'm strong and holy, 
I must do what I've been told." 
So he started up the mountain, 
I was running, he was walking, 
and his axe was made of gold. 
Well, the trees they got much smaller, 
the lake a lady's mirror, 
we stopped to drink some wine. 
Then he threw the bottle over. 
Broke a minute later 
and he put his hand on mine. 
Thought I saw an eagle 
but it might have been a vulture, 
I never could decide. 
Then my father built an altar, 
he looked once behind his shoulder, 
he knew I would not hide. 

You who build these altars now 
to sacrifice these children, 
you must not do it anymore. 
A scheme is not a vision 
and you never have been tempted 
by a demon or a god. 
You who stand above them now, 
your hatchets blunt and bloody, 
you were not there before, 
when I lay upon a mountain 
and my father's hand was trembling 
with the beauty of the word. 

And if you call me brother now, 
forgive me if I inquire, 
"Just according to whose plan" 
When it all comes down to dust 
I will kill you if I must, 
I will help you if I can. 
When it all comes down to dust 
I will help you if I must, 
I will kill you if I can. 
And mercy on our uniform, 
man of peace or man of war, 
the peacock spreads his fan.

"A Bunch Of Lonesome Heroes"

A bunch of lonesome and very quarrelsome heroes 
were smoking out along the open road 
the night was very dark and thick between them, 
each man beneath his ordinary load. 
"I'd like to tell my story," 
said one of them so young and bold, 
"I'd like to tell my story, 
before I turn into gold." 
But no one really could hear him, 
the night so dark and thick and green 
well I guess that these heroes must always live there 
where you and I have only been. 
Put out your cigarette, my love, 
you've been alone too long 
and some of us are very hungry now 
to hear what it is you've done that was so wrong. 

I sing this for the crickets, 
I sing this for the army, 
I sing this for your children 
and for all who do not need me. 
"I'd like to tell my story," 
said one of them so bold, 
"Oh yes, I'd like to tell my story 
'cause you know I feel I'm turning into gold."

"The Partisan"

When they poured across the border
I was cautioned to surrender,
this I could not do
I took my gun and vanished.
I have changed my name so often,
I've lost my wife and children
but I have many friends,
and some of them are with me.

An old woman gave us shelter,
kept us hidden in the garret,
then the soldiers came
she died without a whisper.

There were three of us this morning
I'm the only one this evening
but I must go on
the frontiers are my prison.

Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing,
through the graves the wind is blowing,
freedom soon will come
then we'll come from the shadows.

Les Allemands taient chez moi (The Germans were at my home)
ils m'ont dit "Rsigne-toi" (They said, "Surrender,")
mais je n'ai pas pu (this I could not do)
j'ai repris mon arme (I took my weapon again)

J'ai chang cent fois de nom (I have changed names a hundred times)
j'ai perdu femme et enfants (I have lost wife and children)
mais j'ai tant d'amis (But I have so many friends)
j'ai la France entire (I have all of France)

Un vieil homme dans un grenier (An old man, in an attic)
pour la nuit nous a cachs (Hid us for the night)
les Allemands l'ont pris (The Germans captured him)
il est mort sans surprise (He died without surprise)

Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing,
through the graves the wind is blowing,
freedom soon will come
then we'll come from the shadows.

"Seems So Long Ago, Nancy"

It seems so long ago, 
Nancy was alone, 
looking ate the Late Late show 
through a semi-precious stone. 
In the House of Honesty 
her father was on trial, 
in the House of Mystery 
there was no one at all, 
there was no one at all. 
It seems so long ago, 
none of us were strong 
Nancy wore green stockings 
and she slept with everyone. 
She never said she'd wait for us 
although she was alone, 
I think she fell in love for us 
in nineteen sixty one, 
in nineteen sixty one. 

It seems so long ago, 
Nancy was alone, 
a forty five beside her head, 
an open telephone. 
We told her she was beautiful, 
we told her she was free 
but none of us would meet her in 
the House of Mystery, 
the House of Mystery. 

And now you look around you, 
see her everywhere, 
many use her body, 
many comb her hair. 
In the hollow of the night 
when you are cold and numb 
you hear her talking freely then, 
she's happy that you've come, 
she's happy that you've come.

"The Old Revolution"

I finally broke into the prison, 
I found my place in the chain. 
Even damnation is poisoned with rainbows, 
all the brave young men 
they're waiting now to see a signal 
which some killer will be lighting for pay. 
Into this furnace I ask you now to venture, 
you whom I cannot betray. 

I fought in the old revolution 
on the side of the ghost and the King. 
Of course I was very young 
and I thought that we were winning 
I can't pretend I still feel very much like singing 
as they carry the bodies away. 

Into this furnace I ask you now to venture... 

Lately you've started to stutter 
as though you had nothing to say. 
To all of my architects let me be traitor. 
Now let me say I myself gave the order 
to sleep and to search and to destroy. 

Into this furnace I ask you now to venture... 

Yes, you who are broken by power, 
you who are absent all day, 
you who are kings for the sake of your children's story, 
the hand of your beggar is burdened down with money, 
the hand of your lover is clay. 

Into this furnace I ask you now to venture...

"The Butcher"

I came upon a butcher, 
he was slaughtering a lamb, 
I accused him there 
with his tortured lamb. 
He said, "Listen to me, child, 
I am what I am 
and you, you are my only son." 
Well, I found a silver needle, 
I put it into my arm. 
It did some good, 
did some harm. 
But the nights were cold 
and it almost kept me warm, 
how come the night is long 

I saw some flowers growing up 
where that lamb fell down 
was I supposed to praise my Lord, 
make some kind of joyful sound 
He said, "Listen, listen to me now, 
I go round and round 
and you, you are my only child." 

Do not leave me now, 
do not leave me now, 
I'm broken down 
from a recent fall. 
Blood upon my body 
and ice upon my soul, 
lead on, my son, it is your world.

"You Know Who I Am"

I cannot follow you, my love, 
you cannot follow me. 
I am the distance you put between 
all of the moments that we will be. 
You know who I am, 
you've stared at the sun, 
well I am the one who loves 
changing from nothing to one. 

Sometimes I need you naked, 
sometimes I need you wild, 
I need you to carry my children in 
and I need you to kill a child. 

You know who I am... 

If you should ever track me down 
I will surrender there 
and I will leave with you one broken man 
whom I will teach you to repair. 

You know who I am... 

I cannot follow you, my love, 
you cannot follow me. 
I am the distance you put between 
all of the moments that we will be. 

You know who I am...

"Lady Midnight"

I came by myself to a very crowded place 
I was looking for someone who had lines in her face. 
I found her there but she was past all concern 
I asked her to hold me, I said, "Lady, unfold me," 
but she scorned me and she told me 
I was dead and I could never return. 
Well, I argued all night like so many have before, 
saying, "Whatever you give me, I seem to need so much more." 
Then she pointed at me where I kneeled on her floor, 
she said, "Don't try to use me or slyly refuse me, 
just win me or lose me, 
it is this that the darkness is for." 

I cried, "Oh, Lady Midnight, I fear that you grow old, 
the stars eat your body and the wind makes you cold." 
"If we cry now," she said, "it will just be ignored." 
So I walked through the morning, sweet early morning, 
I could hear my lady calling, 
"You've won me, you've won me, my lord, 
you've won me, you've won me, my lord, 
yes, you've won me, you've won me, my lord, 
ah, you've won me, you've won me, my lord, 
ah, you've won me, you've won me, my lord."

"Tonight Will Be Fine"

Sometimes I find I get to thinking of the past. 
We swore to each other then that our love would surely last. 
You kept right on loving, I went on a fast, 
now I am too thin and your love is too vast. 
But I know from your eyes 
and I know from your smile 
that tonight will be fine, 
will be fine, will be fine, will be fine 
for a while. 

I choose the rooms that I live in with care, 
the windows are small and the walls almost bare, 
there's only one bed and there's only one prayer 
I listen all night for your step on the stair. 

But I know from your eyes 
and I know from your smile 
that tonight will be fine, 
will be fine, will be fine, will be fine 
for a while. 

Oh sometimes I see her undressing for me, 
she's the soft naked lady love meant her to be 
and she's moving her body so brave and so free. 
If I've got to remember that's a fine memory. 

And I know from her eyes 
and I know from her smile 
that tonight will be fine, 
will be fine, will be fine, will be fine 
for a while.

"Avalanche"

Well I stepped into an avalanche, 
it covered up my soul 
when I am not this hunchback that you see, 
I sleep beneath the golden hill. 
You who wish to conquer pain, 
you must learn, learn to serve me well. 
You strike my side by accident 
as you go down for your gold. 
The cripple here that you clothe and feed 
is neither starved nor cold 
he does not ask for your company, 
not at the centre, the centre of the world. 

When I am on a pedestal, 
you did not raise me there. 
Your laws do not compel me 
to kneel grotesque and bare. 
I myself am the pedestal 
for this ugly hump at which you stare. 

You who wish to conquer pain, 
you must learn what makes me kind 
the crumbs of love that you offer me, 
they're the crumbs I've left behind. 
Your pain is no credential here, 
it's just the shadow, shadow of my wound. 

I have begun to long for you, 
I who have no greed 
I have begun to ask for you, 
I who have no need. 
You say you've gone away from me, 
but I can feel you when you breathe. 

Do not dress in those rags for me, 
I know you are not poor 
you don't love me quite so fiercely now 
when you know that you are not sure, 
it is your turn, beloved, 
it is your flesh that I wear.

"Last Year's Man"

The rain falls down on last year's man
That's a Jew's harp on the table
That's a crayon in his hand
And the corners of the blueprint are ruined since they rolled
Far past the stems of thumbtacks
That still throw shadows on the wood
And the skylight is like skin for a drum I'll never mend
And all the rain falls down amen
On the works of last year's man
I met a lady, she was playing with her soldiers in the dark
Oh one by one she had to tell them
That her name was Joan of Arc
I was in that army, yes I stayed a little while
I want to thank you, Joan of Arc
For treating me so well
And though I wear a uniform I was not born to fight
All these wounded boys you lie beside
Goodnight, my friends, goodnight

I came upon a wedding that old families had contrived
Bethlehem the bridegroom
Babylon the bride
Great Babylon was naked, oh she stood there trembling for me
And Bethlehem inflamed us both
Like the shy one at some orgy
And when we fell together all our flesh was like a veil
That I had to draw aside to see
The serpent eat its tail

Some women wait for Jesus, and some women wait for Cain
So I hang upon my altar
And I hoist my axe again
And I take the one who finds me back to where it all began
When Jesus was the honeymoon
And Cain was just the man
And we read from pleasant Bibles that are bound in blood and skin
That the wilderness is gathering
All its children back again

The rain falls down on last year's man
An hour has gone by
And he has not moved his hand
But everything will happen if he only gives the word
The lovers will rise up
And the mountains touch the ground
But the skylight is like skin for a drum I'll never mend
And all the rain falls down amen
On the works of last year's man

"Dress Rehearsal Rag"

Four o'clock in the afternoon 
and I didn't feel like very much. 
I said to myself, "Where are you golden boy, 
where is your famous golden touch" 
I thought you knew where 
all of the elephants lie down, 
I thought you were the crown prince 
of all the wheels in Ivory Town. 
Just take a look at your body now, 
there's nothing much to save 
and a bitter voice in the mirror cries, 
"Hey, Prince, you need a shave." 
Now if you can manage to get 
your trembling fingers to behave, 
why don't you try unwrapping 
a stainless steel razor blade 
That's right, it's come to this, 
yes it's come to this, 
and wasn't it a long way down, 
wasn't it a strange way down 
There's no hot water 
and the cold is running thin. 
Well, what do you expect from 
the kind of places you've been living in 
Don't drink from that cup, 
it's all caked and cracked along the rim. 
That's not the electric light, my friend, 
that is your vision growing dim. 
Cover up your face with soap, there, 
now you're Santa Claus. 
And you've got a gift for anyone 
who will give you his applause. 
I thought you were a racing man, 
ah, but you couldn't take the pace. 
That's a funeral in the mirror 
and it's stopping at your face. 
That's right, it's come to this, 
yes it's come to this, 
and wasn't it a long way down, 
ah wasn't it a strange way down 

Once there was a path 
and a girl with chestnut hair, 
and you passed the summers 
picking all of the berries that grew there 
there were times she was a woman, 
oh, there were times she was just a child, 
and you held her in the shadows 
where the raspberries grow wild. 
And you climbed the twilight mountains 
and you sang about the view, 
and everywhere that you wandered 
love seemed to go along with you. 
That's a hard one to remember, 
yes it makes you clench your fist. 
And then the veins stand out like highways, 
all along your wrist. 
And yes it's come to this, 
it's come to this, 
and wasn't it a long way down, 
wasn't it a strange way down 

You can still find a job, 
go out and talk to a friend. 
On the back of every magazine 
there are those coupons you can send. 
Why don't you join the Rosicrucians, 
they can give you back your hope, 
you can find your love with diagrams 
on a plain brown envelope. 
But you've used up all your coupons 
except the one that seems 
to be written on your wrist 
along with several thousand dreams. 
Now Santa Claus comes forward, 
that's a razor in his mit 
and he puts on his dark glasses 
and he shows you where to hit 
and then the cameras pan, 
the stand in stunt man, 
dress rehearsal rag, 
it's just the dress rehearsal rag, 
you know this dress rehearsal rag, 
it's just a dress rehearsal rag.

"Diamonds In The Mine"

The woman in blue, she's asking for revenge, 
the man in white -- that's you -- says he has no friends. 
The river is swollen up with rusty cans 
and the trees are burning in your promised land. 
And there are no letters in the mailbox, 
and there are no grapes upon the vine, 
and there are no chocolates in the boxes anymore, 
and there are no diamonds in the mine. 

Well, you tell me that your lover has a broken limb, 
you say you're kind of restless now and it's on account of him. 
Well, I saw the man in question, it was just the other night, 
he was eating up a lady where the lions and Christians fight. 

And there are no letters in the mailbox 
and there are no grapes upon the vine, 
and there are no chocolates in the boxes anymore, 
and there are no diamonds in the mine. 

(You tell them now) 

Ah, there is no comfort in the covens of the witch, 
some very clever doctor went and sterilized the bitch, 
and the only man of energy, yes the revolution's pride, 
he trained a hundred women just to kill an unborn child. 

And there are no letters in the mailbox, 
oh no, there are no, no grapes upon your vine, 
and there are, there are no chocolates in your boxes anymore, 
and there are no diamonds in your mine. 
And there are no letters in the mailbox, 
and there are no grapes upon the vine, 
and there are no chocolates in your boxes anymore, 
and there are no diamonds in your mine.

"Love Calls You By Your Name"

You thought that it could never happen 
to all the people that you became, 
your body lost in legend, the beast so very tame. 
But here, right here, 
between the birthmark and the stain, 
between the ocean and your open vein, 
between the snowman and the rain, 
once again, once again, 
love calls you by your name. 
The women in your scrapbook 
whom you still praise and blame, 
you say they chained you to your fingernails 
and you climb the halls of fame. 
Oh but here, right here, 
between the peanuts and the cage, 
between the darkness and the stage, 
between the hour and the age, 
once again, once again, 
love calls you by your name. 

Shouldering your loneliness 
like a gun that you will not learn to aim, 
you stumble into this movie house, 
then you climb, you climb into the frame. 
Yes, and here, right here 
between the moonlight and the lane, 
between the tunnel and the train, 
between the victim and his stain, 
once again, once again, 
love calls you by your name. 

I leave the lady meditating 
on the very love which I, I do not wish to claim, 
I journey down the hundred steps, 
but the street is still the very same. 
And here, right here, 
between the dancer and his cane, 
between the sailboat and the drain, 
between the newsreel and your tiny pain, 
once again, once again, 
love calls you by your name. 

Where are you, Judy, where are you, Anne 
Where are the paths your heroes came 
Wondering out loud as the bandage pulls away, 
was I, was I only limping, was I really lame 
Oh here, come over here, 
between the windmill and the grain, 
between the sundial and the chain, 
between the traitor and her pain, 
once again, once again, 
love calls you by your name.

"Famous Blue Raincoat"

It's four in the morning, the end of December 
I'm writing you now just to see if you're better 
New York is cold, but I like where I'm living 
There's music on Clinton Street all through the evening. 
I hear that you're building your little house deep in the desert 
You're living for nothing now, I hope you're keeping some kind of record. 

Yes, and Jane came by with a lock of your hair 
She said that you gave it to her 
That night that you planned to go clear 
Did you ever go clear 

Ah, the last time we saw you you looked so much older 
Your famous blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder 
You'd been to the station to meet every train 
And you came home without Lili Marlene 

And you treated my woman to a flake of your life 
And when she came back she was nobody's wife. 

Well I see you there with the rose in your teeth 
One more thin gypsy thief 
Well I see Jane's awake -- 

She sends her regards. 

And what can I tell you my brother, my killer 
What can I possibly say 
I guess that I miss you, I guess I forgive you 
I'm glad you stood in my way. 

If you ever come by here, for Jane or for me 
Your enemy is sleeping, and his woman is free. 

Yes, and thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes 
I thought it was there for good so I never tried. 

And Jane came by with a lock of your hair 
She said that you gave it to her 
That night that you planned to go clear -- 

Sincerely, L. Cohen

"Sing Another Song, Boys"

(Let's sing another song, boys, this one has grown old and bitter.) 
Ah his fingernails, I see they're broken, 
his ships they're all on fire. 
The moneylender's lovely little daughter 
ah, she's eaten, she's eaten with desire. 
She spies him through the glasses 
from the pawnshops of her wicked father. 
She hails him with a microphone 
that some poor singer, just like me, had to leave her. 
She tempts him with a clarinet, 
she waves a Nazi dagger. 
She finds him lying in a heap 
she wants to be his woman. 
He says, "Yes, I might go to sleep 
but kindly leave, leave the future, 
leave it open." 

He stands where it is steep, 
oh I guess he thinks that he's the very first one, 
his hand upon his leather belt now 
like it was the wheel of some big ocean liner. 
And she will learn to touch herself so well 
as all the sails burn down like paper. 
And he has lit the chain 
of his famous cigarillo. 
Ah, they'll never, they'll never ever reach the moon, 
at least not the one that we're after 
it's floating broken on the open sea, look out there, my friends, 
and it carries no survivors. 
But lets leave these lovers wondering 
why they cannot have each other, 
and let's sing another song, boys, 
this one has grown old and bitter.

"Joan Of Arc"

Now the flames they followed Joan of Arc 
as she came riding through the dark 
no moon to keep her armour bright, 
no man to get her through this very smoky night. 
She said, "I'm tired of the war, 
I want the kind of work I had before, 
a wedding dress or something white 
to wear upon my swollen appetite." 
Well, I'm glad to hear you talk this way, 
you know I've watched you riding every day 
and something in me yearns to win 
such a cold and lonesome heroine. 
"And who are you" she sternly spoke 
to the one beneath the smoke. 
"Why, I'm fire," he replied, 
"And I love your solitude, I love your pride." 

"Then fire, make your body cold, 
I'm going to give you mine to hold," 
saying this she climbed inside 
to be his one, to be his only bride. 
And deep into his fiery heart 
he took the dust of Joan of Arc, 
and high above the wedding guests 
he hung the ashes of her wedding dress. 

It was deep into his fiery heart 
he took the dust of Joan of Arc, 
and then she clearly understood 
if he was fire, oh then she must be wood. 
I saw her wince, I saw her cry, 
I saw the glory in her eye. 
Myself I long for love and light, 
but must it come so cruel, and oh so bright

"Is This What You Wanted"

You were the promise at dawn, 
I was the morning after. 
You were Jesus Christ my Lord, 
I was the money lender. 
You were the sensitive woman, 
I was the very reverend Freud. 
You were the manual orgasm, 
I was the dirty little boy. 
And is this what you wanted 
to live in a house that is haunted 
by the ghost of you and me 

Is this what you wanted ... 

You were Marlon Brando, 
I was Steve McQueen. 
You were K.Y. Jelly, 
I was Vaseline. 
You were the father of modern medicine, 
I was Mr. Clean. 
You where the whore and the beast of Babylon, 
I was Rin Tin Tin. 

And is this what you wanted ... 

And is this what you wanted ... 

You got old and wrinkled, 
I stayed seventeen. 
You lusted after so many, 
I lay here with one. 
You defied your solitude, 
I came through alone. 
You said you could never love me, 
I undid your gown. 

And is this what you wanted ... 

And is this what you wanted ... 

I mean is this what you wanted ... 

That's right, is this what you wanted ...

"Chelsea Hotel 2"

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel, 
you were talking so brave and so sweet, 
giving me head on the unmade bed, 
while the limousines wait in the street. 
Those were the reasons and that was New York, 
we were running for the money and the flesh. 
And that was called love for the workers in song 
probably still is for those of them left. 
Ah but you got away, didn't you babe, 
you just turned your back on the crowd, 
you got away, I never once heard you say, 
I need you, I don't need you, 
I need you, I don't need you 
and all of that jiving around. 

I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel 
you were famous, your heart was a legend. 
You told me again you preferred handsome men 
but for me you would make an exception. 
And clenching your fist for the ones like us 
who are oppressed by the figures of beauty, 
you fixed yourself, you said, "Well never mind, 
we are ugly but we have the music." 

And then you got away, didn't you babe... 

I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best, 
I can't keep track of each fallen robin. 
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel, 
that's all, I don't even think of you that often.

"Lover Lover Lover"

I asked my father, 
I said, "Father change my name." 
The one I'm using now it's covered up 
with fear and filth and cowardice and shame. 
Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me, 
yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. 

He said, "I locked you in this body, 
I meant it as a kind of trial. 
You can use it for a weapon, 
or to make some woman smile." 

Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me 
yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. 

"Then let me start again," I cried, 
"please let me start again, 
I want a face that's fair this time, 
I want a spirit that is calm." 

Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me 
yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. 

"I never never turned aside," he said, 
"I never walked away. 
It was you who built the temple, 
it was you who covered up my face." 

Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me 
yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. 

And may the spirit of this song, 
may it rise up pure and free. 
May it be a shield for you, 
a shield against the enemy. 

Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me 
yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me. 

Yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me 
yes and lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover come back to me.

"Field Commander Cohen"

Field Commander Cohen, he was our most important spy. 
Wounded in the line of duty, 
parachuting acid into diplomatic cocktail parties, 
urging Fidel Castro to abandon fields and castles. 
Leave it all and like a man, 
come back to nothing special, 
such as waiting rooms and ticket lines, 
silver bullet suicides, 
and messianic ocean tides, 
and racial roller-coaster rides 
and other forms of boredom advertised as poetry. 
I know you need your sleep now, 
I know your life's been hard. 
But many men are falling, 
where you promised to stand guard. 

I never asked but I heard you cast your lot along with the poor. 
But then I overheard your prayer, 
that you be this and nothing more 
than just some grateful faithful woman's favourite singing millionaire, 
the patron Saint of envy and the grocer of despair, 
working for the Yankee Dollar. 

I know you need your sleep now ... 

Ah, lover come and lie with me, if my lover is who you are, 
and be your sweetest self awhile until I ask for more, my child. 
Then let the other selves be wrong, yeah, let them manifest and come 
till every taste is on the tongue, 
till love is pierced and love is hung, 
and every kind of freedom done, then oh, 
oh my love, oh my love, oh my love, 
oh my love, oh my love, oh my love.

"Why Don't You Try"

Why don't you try to do without him 
Why don't you try to live alone 
Do you really need his hands for your passion 
Do you really need his heart for your throne 
Do you need his labour for your baby 
Do you need his beast for the bone 
Do you need to hold a leash to be a lady 
I know you're going to make, make it on your own. 
Why don't your try to forget him 
Just open up your dainty little hand. 
You know this life is filled with many sweet companions, 
many satisfying one-night stands. 
Do you want to be the ditch around a tower 
Do you want to be the moonlight in his cave 
Do you want to give your blessing to his power 
as he goes whistling past his daddy, past his daddy's grave. 

I'd like to take you take you to the ceremony, 
well, that is if I remember the way. 
You see Jack and Jill they're going to join their misery, 
I'm afraid it's time for everyone to pray. 
You can see they've finally taken cover, 
they're willing, yeah they're willing to obey. 
Their vows are difficult, they're for each other, 
so let nobody put a loophole, a loophole in their way.

"There Is A War"

There is a war between the rich and poor, 
a war between the man and the woman. 
There is a war between the ones who say there is a war 
and the ones who say there isn't. 
Why don't you come on back to the war, that's right, get in it, 
why don't you come on back to the war, it's just beginning. 

Well I live here with a woman and a child, 
the situation makes me kind of nervous. 
Yes, I rise up from her arms, she says "I guess you call this love" 
I call it service. 

Why don't you come on back to the war, don't be a tourist, 
why don't you come on back to the war, before it hurts us, 
why don't you come on back to the war, let's all get nervous. 

You cannot stand what I've become, 
you much prefer the gentleman I was before. 
I was so easy to defeat, I was so easy to control, 
I didn't even know there was a war. 

Why don't you come on back to the war, don't be embarrassed, 
why don't you come on back to the war, you can still get married. 

There is a war between the rich and poor, 
a war between the man and the woman. 
There is a war between the left and right, 
a war between the black and white, 
a war between the odd and the even. 

Why don't you come on back to the war, pick up your tiny burden, 
why don't you come on back to the war, let's all get even, 
why don't you come on back to the war, can't you hear me speaking

"A Singer Must Die"

Now the courtroom is quiet, but who will confess. 
Is it true you betrayed us The answer is Yes. 
Then read me the list of the crimes that are mine, 
I will ask for the mercy that you love to decline. 
And all the ladies go moist, and the judge has no choice, 
a singer must die for the lie in his voice. 
And I thank you, I thank you for doing your duty, 
you keepers of truth, you guardians of beauty. 
Your vision is right, my vision is wrong, 
I'm sorry for smudging the air with my song. 

Oh, the night it is thick, my defences are hid 
in the clothes of a woman I would like to forgive, 
in the rings of her silk, in the hinge of her thighs, 
where I have to go begging in beauty's disguise. 
Oh goodnight, goodnight, my night after night, 
my night after night, after night, after night, after night, after night. 

I am so afraid that I listen to you, 
your sun glassed protectors they do that to you. 
It's their ways to detain, their ways to disgrace, 
their knee in your balls and their fist in your face. 
Yes and long live the state by whoever it's made, 
sir, I didn't see nothing, I was just getting home late.

"I Tried To Leave You"

I tried to leave you, I don't deny 
I closed the book on us, at least a hundred times. 
I'd wake up every morning by your side. 
The years go by, you lose your pride. 
The baby's crying, so you do not go outside, 
and all your work it's right before your eyes. 

Goodnight, my darling, I hope you're satisfied, 
the bed is kind of narrow, but my arms are open wide. 
And here's a man still working for your smile.

"Who By Fire"

And who by fire, who by water, 
who in the sunshine, who in the night time, 
who by high ordeal, who by common trial, 
who in your merry merry month of may, 
who by very slow decay, 
and who shall I say is calling 
And who in her lonely slip, who by barbiturate, 
who in these realms of love, who by something blunt, 
and who by avalanche, who by powder, 
who for his greed, who for his hunger, 
and who shall I say is calling 

And who by brave assent, who by accident, 
who in solitude, who in this mirror, 
who by his lady's command, who by his own hand, 
who in mortal chains, who in power, 
and who shall I say is calling

"Take This Longing"

Many men have loved the bells 
you fastened to the rein, 
and everyone who wanted you 
they found what they will always want again. 
Your beauty lost to you yourself 
just as it was lost to them. 
Oh take this longing from my tongue, 
whatever useless things these hands have done. 
Let me see your beauty broken down 
like you would do for one you love. 

Your body like a searchlight 
my poverty revealed, 
I would like to try your charity 
until you cry, "Now you must try my greed." 
And everything depends upon 
how near you sleep to me 

Just take this longing from my tongue 
all the lonely things my hands have done. 
Let me see your beauty broken down 
like you would do for one your love. 

Hungry as an archway 
through which the troops have passed, 
I stand in ruins behind you, 
with your winter clothes, your broken sandal straps. 
I love to see you naked over there 
especially from the back. 

Oh take this longing from my tongue, 
all the useless things my hands have done, 
untie for me your hired blue gown, 
like you would do for one that you love. 

You're faithful to the better man, 
I'm afraid that he left. 
So let me judge your love affair 
in this very room where I have sentenced 
mine to death. 
I'll even wear these old laurel leaves 
that he's shaken from his head. 

Just take this longing from my tongue, 
all the useless things my hands have done, 
let me see your beauty broken down, 
like you would do for one you love. 

Like you would do for one you love.

"Leaving Green Sleeves"

Alas, my love, you did me wrong, 
to cast me out discourteously, 
for I have loved you so long, 
delighting in your very company. 
Now if you intend to show me disdain, 
don't you know it all the more enraptures me, 
for even so I still remain your lover in captivity. 
Green sleeves, you're all alone, 
the leaves have fallen, the men have gone. 
Green sleeves, there's no one home, 
not even the Lady Green Sleeves 

I sang my songs, I told my lies, 
to lie between your matchless thighs. 
And ain't it fine, ain't it wild 
to finally end our exercise 
Then I saw you naked in the early dawn, 
oh, I hoped you would be someone new. 
I reached for you but you were gone, 
so lady I'm going too. 

Green sleeves, you're all alone ... 

Green sleeves, you're all alone, 
the leaves have fallen, the men have all gone home. 
Green sleeves, it's so easily done, 
leaving the Lady Green Sleeves.

"True Love Leaves No Traces"

As the mist leaves no scar 
On the dark green hill 
So my body leaves no scar 
On you and never will 
Through windows in the dark 
The children come, the children go 
Like arrows with no targets 
Like shackles made of snow 

True love leaves no traces 
If you and I are one 
It's lost in our embraces 
Like stars against the sun 

As a falling leaf may rest 
A moment on the air 
So your head upon my breast 
So my hand upon your hair 

And many nights endure 
Without a moon or star 
So we will endure 
When one is gone and far 

True love leaves no traces 
If you and I are one 
It's lost in our embraces 
Like stars against the sun

"Iodine"

I needed you, I knew I was in danger
Of losing what I used to think was mine
You let me love you till I was a failure
You let me love you till I was a failure
Your beauty on my bruise like iodine

I asked you if a man could be forgiven
And though I failed at love, was this a crime
You said, "Don't worry, don't worry, darling,"
You said, "Don't worry, don't you worry, darling
There are many ways a man can serve his time"

You covered up that place I could not master
It wasn't dark enough to shut my eyes
So I was with you, oh sweet compassion
Yes I was with you, oh sweet compassion
Compassion with the sting of iodine

Your saintly kisses reeked of iodine
Your fragrance with a fume of iodine
And pity in the room like iodine

My masquerade of trust was iodine
And everywhere the flare of iodine
Yes it started with the flare of iodine

"Paper Thin Hotel"

The walls of this hotel are paper-thin 
Last night I heard you making love to him 
The struggle mouth to mouth and limb to limb 
The grunt of unity when he came in 
I stood there with my ear against the wall 
I was not seized by jealousy at all 
In fact a burden lifted from my soul 
I heard that love was out of my control 
A heavy burden lifted from my soul 
I heard that love was out of my control 

I listened to your kisses at the door 
I never heard the world so clear before 
You ran your bath and you began to sing 
I felt so good I couldn't feel a thing 

I stood there with my ear against the wall ... 

And I can't wait to tell you to your face 
And I can't wait for you to take my place 
You are The Naked Angel In My Heart 
You are The Woman With Her Legs Apart 
It's written on the walls of this hotel 
You go to heaven once you've been to hell 

A heavy burden lifted from my soul 
I heard that love was out of my control

"Memories"

Frankie Laine, he was singing Jezebel
I pinned an Iron Cross to my lapel
I walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl
I said, "Look, you don't know me now but very soon you will
So won't you let me see"
I said "won't you let me see"
I said "won't you let me see
Your naked body"

"Just dance me to the dark side of the gym
Chances are I will let you do most anything
I know you're hungry, I can hear it in your voice
And there are many parts of me to touch, you have your choice
Ah but no you cannot see
She said "No you cannot see"
She said "No you cannot see
My naked body"

So we're dancing close, the band is playing Stardust
The balloons and paper streamers they're floating down on us
She says, "You've got a minute left to fall in love"
In solemn moments such as this I have put my trust
And all my faith to see
I said all my faith to see
I said all my faith to see
Her naked body
Naked body

All my faith...

(...you cheated you lied)

"I Left A Woman Waiting"

I left a woman waiting 
I met her sometime later 
She said, I see your eyes are dead 
What happened to you, lover 
What happened to you, my lover 
What happened to you, lover 
What happened to you 
And since she spoke the truth to me 
I tried to answer truthfully 
Whatever happened to my eyes 
Happened to your beauty 
Happened to your beauty 
What happened to your beauty 
Happened to me 

We took ourselves to someone's bed 
And there we fell together 
Quick as dogs and truly dead were we 
And free as running water 
Free as running water 
Free as running water 
Free as you and me 
The way it's got to be 
The way it's got to be, lover

"Don't Go Home With Your Hard-On"

I was born in a beauty salon 
My father was a dresser of hair 
My mother was a girl you could call on 
When you called she was always there 
When you called she was always there 
When you called she was always there 
When you called she was always there 
When you called she was always there 

Ah but don't go home with your hard-on 
It will only drive you insane 
You can't shake it (or break it) with your Motown 
You can't melt it down in the rain 

You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 

I've looked behind all of the faces 
That smile you down to you knees 
And the lips that say, Come on, taste us 
And when you try to they make you say Please 

When you try to they make you say Please 
When you try to they make you say Please 
When you try to they make you say Please 
When you try to they make you say Please 

Ah but don't go home with your hard-on ... 

Here come's your bride with her veil on 
Approach her, you wretch, if you dare 
Approach her, you ape with your tail on 
Once you have her she'll always be there 

Once you have her she'll always be there 
Once you have her she'll always be there 
Once you have her she'll always be there 
Once you have her she'll always be there 

Ah but don't go home with your hard-on ... 

So I work in that same beauty salon 
I'm chained to the old masquerade 
The lipstick, the shadow, the silicone 
I follow my father's trade 

I follow my father's trade 
Yes I follow my father's trade 
Yes I follow my father's trade 
Yes I follow my father's trade 

Ah but don't go home with your hard-on 
It will only drive you insane 
You can't shake it (or break it) with your Motown 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain 
You can't melt it down in the rain

"Fingerprints"

I touched you once too often 
Now I don't know who I am 
My fingerprints were missing 
When I wiped away the jam 
Yes I called my fingerprints all night 
But they don't seem to care 
The last time that I saw them 
They were leafing through your hair 

Fingerprints, fingerprints 
Where are you now my fingerprints 

Yeah I thought I'd leave this morning 
So I emptied out your drawer 
A hundred thousand fingerprints 
They floated to the floor 

You know you hardly stopped to pick them up 
You don't care what you lose 
Ah you don't even seem to know 
Whose fingerprints are whose 

Fingerprints, fingerprints 
Where are you now my fingerprints 

And now you want to marry me 
You want to take me down the aisle 
You want to throw confetti fingerprints 
You know that's not my style 

O sure I'd like to marry you 
But I can't face the dawn 
With any girl who knew me 
When my fingerprints were on 

Fingerprints, fingerprints 
Where are you now my fingerprints 

Fingerprints, oh fingerprints 
Where are you now my fingerprints

"Death Of A Ladies' Man"

Ah the man she wanted all her life was hanging by a thread 
"I never even knew how much I wanted you," she said. 
His muscles they were numbered and his style was obsolete. 
"O baby, I have come too late." She knelt beside his feet. 
"I'll never see a face like yours in years of men to come 
I'll never see such arms again in wrestling or in love." 
And all his virtues burning in the smoky Holocaust 
She took unto herself most everything her lover lost 
Now the master of this landscape he was standing at the view 
with a sparrow of St. Francis that he was preaching to 
She beckoned to the sentry of his high religious mood 
She said, "I'll make a place between my legs, 
I'll show you solitude." 

He offered her an orgy in a many mirrored room 
He promised her protection for the issue of her womb 
She moved her body hard against a sharpened metal spoon 
She stopped the bloody rituals of passage to the moon 

She took his much admired oriental frame of mind 
and the heart-of-darkness alibi his money hides behind 
She took his blonde madonna and his monastery wine -- 
"This mental space is occupied and everything is mine." 

He tried to make a final stand beside the railway track 
She said, "The art of longing's over and it's never coming back." 
She took his tavern parliament, his cap, his cocky dance, 
she mocked his female fashions and his working-class moustache. 

The last time that I saw him he was trying hard to get 
a woman's education but he's not a woman yet 
And the last time that I saw her she was living with some boy 
who gives her soul an empty room and gives her body joy. 

So the great affair is over but whoever would have guessed 
it would leave us all so vacant and so deeply unimpressed 
It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star 
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far. 

It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star 
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far. 

It's like our visit to the moon or to that other star 
I guess you go for nothing if you really want to go that far.

"The Guests"

One by one, the guests arrive 
The guests are coming through 
The open-hearted many 
The broken-hearted few 
And no one knows where the night is going 
And no one knows why the wine is flowing 
Oh love I need you 
I need you 
I need you 
I need you 
Oh . . . I need you now 

And those who dance, begin to dance 
Those who weep begin 
And "Welcome, welcome" cries a voice 
"Let all my guests come in." 

And no one knows where the night is going ... 

And all go stumbling through that house 
in lonely secrecy 
Saying "Do reveal yourself" 
or "Why has thou forsaken me" 

And no one knows where the night is going ... 

All at once the torches flare 
The inner door flies open 
One by one they enter there 
In every style of passion 

And no one knows where the night is going ... 

And here they take their sweet repast 
While house and grounds dissolve 
And one by one the guests are cast 
Beyond the garden wall 

And no one knows where the night is going ... 

Those who dance, begin to dance 
Those who weep begin 
Those who earnestly are lost 
Are lost and lost again 

And no one knows where the night is going ... 

One by the guests arrive 
The guests are coming through 
The broken-hearted many 
The open-hearted few 

And no one knows where the night is going ...

"Humbled In Love"

Do you remember all of those pledges 
That we pledged in the passionate night 
Ah they're soiled now, they're torn at the edges 
Like moths on a still yellow light 
No penance serves to renew them 
No massive transfusions of trust 
Why not even revenge can undo them 
So twisted these vows and so crushed 
And you say you've been humbled in love 
Cut down in your love 
Forced to kneel in the mud next to me 
Ah but why so bitterly turn from the one 
Who kneels there as deeply as thee 

Children have takes these pledges 
They have ferried them out of the past 
Oh beyond all the graves and the hedges 
Where love must go hiding at last 
And here where there is no description 
Oh here in the moment at hand 
No sinner need rise up forgiven 
No victim need limp to the stand 

And you say you've been humbled in love... 

And look dear heart, look at the virgin 
Look how she welcomes him into her gown 
Yes, and mark how the stranger's cold armour 
Dissolves like a star falling down 
Why trade this vision for desire 
When you may have them both 
You will never see a man this naked 
I will never hold a woman this close 

And you say you've been humbled in love...

"The Window"

Why do you stand by the window 
Abandoned to beauty and pride 
The thorn of the night in your bosom 
The spear of the age in your side 
Lost in the rages of fragrance 
Lost in the rags of remorse 
Lost in the waves of a sickness 
That loosens the high silver nerves 
Oh chosen love, Oh frozen love 
Oh tangle of matter and ghost 
Oh darling of angels, demons and saints 
And the whole broken-hearted host 
Gentle this soul 

And come forth from the cloud of unknowing 
And kiss the cheek of the moon 
The New Jerusalem glowing 
Why tarry all night in the ruin 
And leave no word of discomfort 
And leave no observer to mourn 
But climb on your tears and be silent 
Like a rose on its ladder of thorns 

Oh chosen love, Oh frozen love... 

Then lay your rose on the fire 
The fire give up to the sun 
The sun give over to splendour 
In the arms of the high holy one 
For the holy one dreams of a letter 
Dreams of a letter's death 
Oh bless thee continuous stutter 
Of the word being made into flesh 

Oh chosen love, Oh frozen love... 

Gentle this soul

"Came So Far For Beauty"

I came so far for beauty
I left so much behind
My patience and my family
My masterpiece unsigned

I thought I'd be rewarded
For such a lonely choice
And surely she would answer
To such a very hopeless voice

I practiced on my sainthood
I gave to one and all
But the rumours of my virtue
They moved her not at all

I changed my style to silver
I changed my clothes to black
And where I would surrender
Ah now I would attack

I stormed the old casino
For the money and the flesh
And I myself decided
What was rotten and what was fresh

And men to do my bidding
And broken bones to teach
The value of my pardon
The shadow of my reach

But no, I could not touch her
With such a heavy hand
Her star beyond my order
Her nakedness unmanned

I came so far for beauty
I left so much behind
My patience and my family
My masterpiece unsigned

"Un Canadien Errant (The Lost Canadian)"

Un Canadien Errant (A wandering Canadian,)
Banni de ses foyers, (banned from his hearths,)
Parcourait en pleurant (travelled while crying)
Des pays etrangers. (in foreign lands.)

"The Traitor"

Now the Swan it floated on the English river 
Ah the Rose of High Romance it opened wide 
A sun tanned woman yearned me through the summer 
and the judges watched us from the other side 
I told my mother "Mother I must leave you 
preserve my room but do not shed a tear 
Should rumour of a shabby ending reach you 
it was half my fault and half the atmosphere" 

But the Rose I sickened with a scarlet fever 
and the Swan I tempted with a sense of shame 
She said at last I was her finest lover 
and if she withered I would be to blame 

The judges said you missed it by a fraction 
rise up and brace your troops for the attack 
Ah the dreamers ride against the men of action 
Oh see the men of action falling back 

But I lingered on her thighs a fatal moment 
I kissed her lips as though I thirsted still 
My falsity had stung me like a hornet 
The poison sank and it paralysed my will 

I could not move to warn all the younger soldiers 
that they had been deserted from above 
So on battlefields from here to Barcelona 
I'm listed with the enemies of love 

And long ago she said "I must be leaving, 
Ah but keep my body here to lie upon 
You can move it up and down and when I'm sleeping 
Run some wire through that Rose and wind the Swan" 

So daily I renew my idle duty 
I touch her here and there -- I know my place 
I kiss her open mouth and I praise her beauty 
and people call me traitor to my face

"Our Lady Of Solitude"

All summer long she touched me 
She gathered in my soul 
From many a thorn, from many thickets 
Her fingers, like a weaver's 
Quick and cool 
And the light came from her body 
And the night went through her grace 
All summer long she touched me 
And I knew her, I knew her 
Face to face 

And her dress was blue and silver 
And her words were few and small 
She is the vessel of the whole wide world 
Mistress, oh mistress, of us all 

Dearly dead Queen of Solitude 
I thank you with my heart 
for keeping me so close to thee 
while so many, oh so many, stood apart 

And the light came from her body 
And the night went through her grace 
All summer long she touched me 
I knew her, I knew her 
Face to face

"The Gypsy's Wife"

And where, where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight
I've heard all the wild reports, they can't be right
But whose head is this she's dancing with on the threshing floor
Whose darkness deepens in her arms a little more
And where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight
Where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight

Ah the silver knives are flashing in the tired old cafe
A ghost climbs on the table in a bridal negligee
She says, "My body is the light, my body is the way"
I raise my arm against it all and I catch the bride's bouquet

And where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight
Where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight

Too early for the rainbow, too early for the dove
These are the final days, this is the darkness, this is the flood
And there is no man or woman can be touched
But you who come between them will be judged

And where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight
Where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight

"The Smokey Life"

I've never seen your eyes so wide 
I've never seen your appetite quite this occupied 
Elsewhere is your feast of love 
I know ... where long ago we agreed to keep it light 
So lets be married one more night 
It's light, light enough 
To let it go 
It's light enough to let it go 

Remember when the scenery started fading 
I held you til you learned to walk on air 
So don't look down the ground is gone, 
there's no one waiting anyway 
The Smoky Life is practiced 
Everywhere 

So set your restless heart at ease 
Take a lesson from these Autumn leaves 
They waste no time waiting for the snow 
Don't argue now you'll be late 
There is nothing to investigate 

It's light enough, light enough 
To let it go 
Light enough to let it go 

Remember when the scenery started fading 
I held you til you learned to walk on air 
So don't look down the ground is gone, 
there's no one waiting anyway 
The Smoky Life is practiced everywhere 

Come on back if the moment lends 
You can look up all my very closest friends 

Light, light enough 
To let it go 
It's light enough to let it go

"Ballad Of The Absent Mare"

Say a prayer for the cowboy 
His mare's run away 
And he'll walk til he finds her 
His darling, his stray 
but the river's in flood 
and the roads are awash 
and the bridges break up 
in the panic of loss. 
And there's nothing to follow 
There's nowhere to go 
She's gone like the summer 
gone like the snow 
And the crickets are breaking 
his heart with their song 
as the day caves in 
and the night is all wrong 

Did he dream, was it she 
who went galloping past 
and bent down the fern 
broke open the grass 
and printed the mud with 
the iron and the gold 
that he nailed to her feet 
when he was the lord 

And although she goes grazing 
a minute away 
he tracks her all night 
he tracks her all day 
Oh blind to her presence 
except to compare 
his injury here 
with her punishment there 

Then at home on a branch 
in the highest tree 
a songbird sings out 
so suddenly 
Ah the sun is warm 
and the soft winds ride 
on the willow trees 
by the river side 

Oh the world is sweet 
the world is wide 
and she's there where 
the light and the darkness divide 
and the steam's coming off her 
she's huge and she's shy 
and she steps on the moon 
when she paws at the sky 

And she comes to his hand 
but she's not really tame 
She longs to be lost 
he longs for the same 
and she'll bolt and she'll plunge 
through the first open pass 
to roll and to feed 
in the sweet mountain grass 

Or she'll make a break 
for the high plateau 
where there's nothing above 
and there's nothing below 
and it's time for the burden 
it's time for the whip 
Will she walk through the flame 
Can he shoot from the hip 

So he binds himself 
to the galloping mare 
and she binds herself 
to the rider there 
and there is no space 
but there's left and right 
and there is no time 
but there's day and night 

And he leans on her neck 
and he whispers low 
"Whither thou goest 
I will go" 
And they turn as one 
and they head for the plain 
No need for the whip 
Ah, no need for the rein 

Now the clasp of this union 
who fastens it tight 
Who snaps it asunder 
the very next night 
Some say the rider 
Some say the mare 
Or that love's like the smoke 
beyond all repair 

But my darling says 
"Leonard, just let it go by 
That old silhouette 
on the great western sky" 
So I pick out a tune 
and they move right along 
and they're gone like the smoke 
and they're gone like this song

"Dance Me To The End Of Love"

Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin 
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in 
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove 
Dance me to the end of love 
Dance me to the end of love 
Oh let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone 
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon 
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of 
Dance me to the end of love 
Dance me to the end of love 

Dance me to the wedding now, dance me on and on 
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long 
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above 
Dance me to the end of love 
Dance me to the end of love 

Dance me to the children who are asking to be born 
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn 
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn 
Dance me to the end of love 

Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin 
Dance me through the panic till I'm gathered safely in 
Touch me with your naked hand, touch me with your glove
Dance me to the end of love 
Dance me to the end of love 
Dance me to the end of love

"Coming Back To You"

Maybe I'm still hurting 
I can't turn the other cheek 
But you know that I still love you 
It's just that I can't speak 
I looked for you in everyone 
And they called me on that too 
I lived alone but I was only 
Coming back to you 
Ah they're shutting down the factory now 
Just when all the bills are due 
And the fields they're under lock and key 
Tho' the rain and the sun come through 
And springtime starts but then it stops 
In the name of something new 
And all the senses rise against this 
Coming back to you 

And they're handing down my sentence now 
And I know what I must do 
Another mile of silence while I'm 
Coming back to you 

There are many in your life 
And many still to be 
Since you are a shining light 
There's many that you'll see 
But I have to deal with envy 
When you choose the precious few 
Who've left their pride on the other side of 
Coming back to you 

Even in your arms I know 
I'll never get it right 
Even when you bend to give me 
Comfort in the night 
I've got to have your word on this 
Or none of it is true 
And all I've said was just instead of 
Coming back to you

"The Law"

How many times did you call me 
And I knew it was late 
I left everybody 
But I never went straight 
I don't claim to be guilty 
But I do understand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 
Now my heart's like a blister 
From doing what I do 
If the moon has a sister 
It's got to be you 
I'm going to miss you forever 
Tho' it's not what I planned 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 

Now the deal has been dirty 
Since dirty began 
I'm not asking for mercy 
Not from the man 
You just don't ask for mercy 
While you're still on the stand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 

I don't claim to be guilty 
Guilty's too grand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 

That's all I can say, baby 
That's all I can say 
It wasn't for nothing 
That they put me away 
I fell with my angel 
Down the chain of command 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand 
There's a Law, there's an Arm, there's a Hand

"The Night Comes On"

I went down to the place 
Where I knew she lay waiting 
Under the marble and the snow 
I said, Mother I'm frightened 
The thunder and the lightning 
I'll never come through this alone 
She said, I'll be with you 
My shawl wrapped around you 
My hand on your head when you go 
And the night came on 
It was very calm 
I wanted the night to go on and on 
But she said, Go back, Go back to the World 

We were fighting in Egypt 
When they signed this agreement 
That nobody else had to die 
There was this terrible sound 
My father went down 
With a terrible wound in his side 
He said, Try to go on 
Take my books, take my gun 
Remember, my son, how they lied 
And the night comes on 
It's very calm 
I'd like to pretend that my father was wrong 
But you don't want to lie, not to the young 

We were locked in this kitchen 
I took to religion 
And I wondered how long she would stay 
I needed so much 
To have nothing to touch 
I've always been greedy that way 
But my son and my daughter 
Climbed out of the water 
Crying, Papa, you promised to play 
And they lead me away 
To the great surprise 
It's Papa, don't peek, Papa, cover your eyes 
And they hide, they hide in the World 

Now I look for her always 
I'm lost in this calling 
I'm tied to the threads of some prayer 
Saying, When will she summon me 
When will she come to me 
What must I do to prepare 
When she bends to my longing 
Like a willow, like a fountain 
She stands in the luminous air 
And the night comes on 
And it's very calm 
I lie in her arms she says, When I'm gone
I'll be yours, yours for a song 

Now the crickets are singing 
The vesper bells ringing 
The cat's curled asleep in his chair 
I'll go down to Bill's Bar 
I can make it that far 
And I'll see if my friends are still there 
Yes, and here's to the few 
Who forgive what you do 
And the fewer who don't even care 
And the night comes on 
It's very calm 
I want to cross over, I want to go home 
But she says, Go back, go back to the World

"Hallelujah"

Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I didwell, reallywhat's it to you
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the Lord of Song
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah

"The Captain"

Now the Captain called me to his bed 
He fumbled for my hand 
"Take these silver bars," he said 
"I'm giving you command." 
"Command of what, there's no one here 
There's only you and me -- 
All the rest are dead or in retreat 
Or with the enemy." 
"Complain, complain, that's all you've done 
Ever since we lost 
If it's not the Crucifixion 
Then it's the Holocaust." 
"May Christ have mercy on your soul 
For making such a joke 
Amid these hearts that burn like coal 
And the flesh that rose like smoke." 

"I know that you have suffered, lad, 
But suffer this awhile 
Whatever makes a soldier sad 
Will make a killer smile." 
"I'm leaving, Captain, I've got to go 
There's blood upon your hand 
But tell me, Captain, if you know 
Of a decent place to stand." 

"There is no decent place to stand 
In a massacre 
But if a woman take your hand 
Then go and stand with her." 
"I left a wife in Tennessee 
And a baby in Saigon -- 
I risked my life, but not to hear 
Some country-western song." 

"Ah but if you cannot raise your love 
To a very high degree, 
Then you're just the man I've been thinking of -- 
So come and stand with me." 
"Your standing days are done," I cried, 
"You'll rally me no more. 
I don't even know what side 
We fought on, or what for." 

"I'm on the side that's always lost 
Against the side of Heaven 
I'm on the side of Snake-eyes tossed 
Against the side of Seven. 
And I've read the Bill of Human Rights 
And some of it was true 
But there wasn't any burden left 
So I'm laying it on you." 

Now the Captain he was dying 
But the Captain wasn't hurt 
The silver bars were in my hand 
I pinned them to my shirt.

"Hunter's Lullaby"

Your father's gone a-hunting 
He's deep in the forest so wild 
And he cannot take his wife with him 
He cannot take his child 
Your father's gone a-hunting 
In the quicksand and the clay 
And a woman cannot follow him 
Although she knows the way 

Your father's gone a-hunting 
Through the silver and the glass 
Where only greed can enter 
But spirit, spirit cannot pass 

Your father's gone a-hunting 
For the beast we'll never bind
And he leaves a baby sleeping 
And his blessings all behind 

Your father's gone a-hunting 
And he's lost his lucky charm 
And he's lost the guardian heart 
That keeps the hunter from the harm 

Your father's gone a-hunting 
He asked me to say goodbye 
And he warned me not to stop him 
I wouldn't, I wouldn't even try

"Heart With No Companion"

I greet you from the other side 
Of sorrow and despair 
With a love so vast and shattered 
It will reach you everywhere 
And I sing this for the captain 
Whose ship has not been built 
For the mother in confusion 
Her cradle still unfilled 

For the heart with no companion 
For the soul without a king 
For the prima ballerina 
Who cannot dance to anything 

Through the days of shame that are coming 
Through the nights of wild distress 
Tho' your promise count for nothing 
You must keep it nonetheless 

You must keep it for the captain 
Whose ship has not been built 
For the mother in confusion 
Her cradle still unfilled 

For the heart with no companion ... 

I greet you from the other side ...

"If It Be Your Will"

If it be your will
That I speak no more
And my voice be still
As it was before
I will speak no more
I shall abide until
I am spoken for
If it be your will

If it be your will
That a voice be true
From this broken hill
I will sing to you
From this broken hill
All your praises they shall ring
If it be your will
To let me sing

From this broken hill 
All your praises they shall ring 
If it be your will 
To let me sing 

If it be your will 
If there is a choice 
Let the rivers fill 
Let the hills rejoice 
Let your mercy spill
On all these burning hearts in hell
If it be your will
To make us well

And draw us near
And bind us tight
All your children here
In their rags of light
In our rags of light
All dressed to kill
And end this night
If it be your will
If it be your will

"First We Take Manhattan"

They sentenced me to twenty years of boredom 
For trying to change the system from within 
I'm coming now, I'm coming to reward them 
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin 
I'm guided by a signal in the heavens 
I'm guided by this birthmark on my skin 
I'm guided by the beauty of our weapons 
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin 

I'd really like to live beside you, baby 
I love your body and your spirit and your clothes 
But you see that line there moving through the station 
I told you, I told you, told you, I was one of those 

Ah you loved me as a loser, but now you're worried that I just might win 
You know the way to stop me, but you don't have the discipline 
How many nights I prayed for this, to let my work begin 
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin 

I don't like your fashion business mister 
And I don't like these drugs that keep you thin 
I don't like what happened to my sister 
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin 

I'd really like to live beside you, baby ... 

And I thank you for those items that you sent me 
The monkey and the plywood violin 
I practiced every night, now I'm ready 
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin 

I am guided 

Ah remember me, I used to live for music 
Remember me, I brought your groceries in 
Well it's Father's Day and everybody's wounded 
First we take Manhattan, then we take Berlin

"Ain't No Cure For Love"

I loved you for a long, long time 
I know this love is real 
It don't matter how it all went wrong 
That don't change the way I feel 
And I can't believe that time's 
Gonna heal this wound I'm speaking of 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure for love 
I'm aching for you baby 
I can't pretend I'm not 
I need to see you naked 
In your body and your thought 
I've got you like a habit 
And I'll never get enough 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure for love 

There ain't no cure for love 
There ain't no cure for love 
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky 
The holy books are open wide 
The doctors working day and night 
But they'll never ever find that cure for love 
There ain't no drink no drug 
(Ah tell them, angels) 
There's nothing pure enough to be a cure for love 

I see you in the subway and I see you on the bus 
I see you lying down with me, I see you waking up 
I see your hand, I see your hair 
Your bracelets and your brush 
And I call to you, I call to you 
But I don't call soft enough 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure for love 

I walked into this empty church I had no place else to go 
When the sweetest voice I ever heard, whispered to my soul 
I don't need to be forgiven for loving you so much 
It's written in the scriptures 
It's written there in blood 
I even heard the angels declare it from above 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure, 
There ain't no cure for love 

There ain't no cure for love 
There ain't no cure for love 
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky 
The holy books are open wide 
The doctors working day and night 
But they'll never ever find that cure, 
That cure for love

"Everybody Knows"

Everybody knows that the dice are loaded 
Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed 
Everybody knows that the war is over 
Everybody knows the good guys lost 
Everybody knows the fight was fixed 
The poor stay poor, the rich get rich 
That's how it goes 
Everybody knows 
Everybody knows that the boat is leaking 
Everybody knows that the captain lied 
Everybody got this broken feeling 
Like their father or their dog just died 

Everybody talking to their pockets 
Everybody wants a box of chocolates 
And a long stem rose 
Everybody knows 

Everybody knows that you love me baby 
Everybody knows that you really do 
Everybody knows that you've been faithful 
Ah give or take a night or two 
Everybody knows you've been discreet 
But there were so many people you just had to meet 
Without your clothes 
And everybody knows 

Everybody knows, everybody knows 
That's how it goes 
Everybody knows 

Everybody knows, everybody knows 
That's how it goes 
Everybody knows 

And everybody knows that it's now or never 
Everybody knows that it's me or you 
And everybody knows that you live forever 
Ah when you've done a line or two 
Everybody knows the deal is rotten 
Old Black Joe's still pickin' cotton 
For your ribbons and bows 
And everybody knows 

And everybody knows that the Plague is coming 
Everybody knows that it's moving fast 
Everybody knows that the naked man and woman 
Are just a shining artifact of the past 
Everybody knows the scene is dead 
But there's gonna be a meter on your bed 
That will disclose 
What everybody knows 

And everybody knows that you're in trouble 
Everybody knows what you've been through 
From the bloody cross on top of Calvary 
To the beach of Malibu 
Everybody knows it's coming apart 
Take one last look at this Sacred Heart 
Before it blows 
And everybody knows 

Everybody knows, everybody knows 
That's how it goes 
Everybody knows 

Oh everybody knows, everybody knows 
That's how it goes 
Everybody knows 

Everybody knows

"I'm Your Man"

If you want a lover 
I'll do anything you ask me to 
And if you want another kind of love 
I'll wear a mask for you 
If you want a partner 
Take my hand 
Or if you want to strike me down in anger 
Here I stand 
I'm your man 
If you want a boxer 
I will step into the ring for you 
And if you want a doctor 
I'll examine every inch of you 
If you want a driver 
Climb inside 
Or if you want to take me for a ride 
You know you can 
I'm your man 

Ah, the moon's too bright 
The chain's too tight 
The beast won't go to sleep 
I've been running through these promises to you 
That I made and I could not keep 
Ah but a man never got a woman back 
Not by begging on his knees 
Or I'd crawl to you baby 
And I'd fall at your feet 
And I'd howl at your beauty 
Like a dog in heat 
And I'd claw at your heart 
And I'd tear at your sheet 
I'd say please, please 
I'm your man 

And if you've got to sleep 
A moment on the road 
I will steer for you 
And if you want to work the street alone 
I'll disappear for you 
If you want a father for your child 
Or only want to walk with me a while 
Across the sand 
I'm your man 

If you want a lover 
I'll do anything you ask me to 
And if you want another kind of love 
I'll wear a mask for you

"Take This Waltz"

Now in Vienna there's ten pretty women 
There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry 
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows 
There's a tree where the doves go to die 
There's a piece that was torn from the morning 
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws 
Oh I want you, I want you, I want you 
On a chair with a dead magazine 
In the cave at the tip of the lily 
In some hallways where love's never been 
On a bed where the moon has been sweating 
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
Take its broken waist in your hand 

This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz 
With its very own breath of brandy and Death 
Dragging its tail in the sea 

There's a concert hall in Vienna 
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews 
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking 
They've been sentenced to death by the blues 
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture 
With a garland of freshly cut tears 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
Take this waltz it's been dying for years 

There's an attic where children are playing 
Where I've got to lie down with you soon 
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns 
In the mist of some sweet afternoon 
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow 
All your sheep and your lilies of snow 
Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
With its "I'll never forget you, you know" 

This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz ... 

And I'll dance with you in Vienna 
I'll be wearing a river's disguise 
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder, 
My mouth on the dew of your thighs 
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook, 
With the photographs there, and the moss 
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty 
My cheap violin and my cross 
And you'll carry me down on your dancing 
To the pools that you lift on your wrist 
Oh my love, Oh my love 
Take this waltz, take this waltz 
It's yours now. It's all that there is

"Jazz Police"

Can you tell me why the bells are ringing 
Nothing's happened in a million years 
I've been sitting here since Wednesday morning 
Wednesday morning can't believe my ears 
Jazz police are looking through my folders 
Jazz police are talking to my niece 
Jazz police have got their final orders 
Jazzer, drop your axe, it's Jazz police 

Jesus taken serious by the many 
Jesus taken joyous by a few 
Jazz police are paid by J. Paul Getty 
Jazzers paid by J. Paul Getty II 

Jazz police I hear you calling 
Jazz police I feel so blue 
Jazz police I think I'm falling, 
I'm falling for you 

Wild as any freedom loving racist 
I applaud the actions of the chief 
Tell me now oh beautiful and spacious 
Am I in trouble with the Jazz police 

Jazz police are looking through my folders ... 

They will never understand our culture 
They'll never understand the Jazz police 
Jazz police are working for my mother 
Blood is thicker margarine than grease 

Let me be somebody I admire 
Let me be that muscle down the street 
Stick another turtle on the fire 
Guys like me are mad for turtle meat 

Jazz police I hear you calling 
Jazz police I feel so blue 
Jazz police I think I'm falling, 
I'm falling for you

"I Can't Forget"

I stumbled out of bed 
I got ready for the struggle 
I smoked a cigarette 
And I tightened up my gut 
I said this can't be me 
Must be my double 
And I can't forget, I can't forget 
I can't forget but I don't remember what 
I'm burning up the road 
I'm heading down to Phoenix 
I got this old address 
Of someone that I knew 
It was high and fine and free 
Ah, you should have seen us 
And I can't forget, I can't forget 
I can't forget but I don't remember who 

I'll be there today 
With a big bouquet of cactus 
I got this rig that runs on memories 
And I promise, cross my heart, 
They'll never catch us 
But if they do, just tell them it was me 

Yeah I loved you all my life 
And that's how I want to end it 
The summer's almost gone 
The winter's tuning up 
Yeah, the summer's gone 
But a lot goes on forever 
And I can't forget, I can't forget 
I can't forget but I don't remember what

"Tower Of Song"

Well my friends are gone and my hair is grey
I ache in the places where I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
I'm just paying my rent every day
Oh in the Tower of Song

I said to Hank Williams how lonely does it get
Hank Williams hasn't answered yet
But I hear him coughing all night long
A hundred floors above me
In the Tower of Song

I was born like this, I had no choice
I was born with the gift of a golden voice
And twenty-seven angels from the Great Beyond
They tied me to this table right here
In the Tower of Song

So you can stick your little pins in that voodoo doll
I'm very sorry, baby, doesn't look like me at all
I'm standing by the window where the light is strong
Ah they don't let a woman kill you
Not in the Tower of Song

Now you can say that I've grown bitter but of this you may be sure
The rich have got their channels in the bedrooms of the poor
And there's a mighty judgment coming, but I may be wrong
You see, you hear these funny voices
In the Tower of Song

I see you standing on the other side
I don't know how the river got so wide
I loved you baby, way back when
And all the bridges are burning that we might have crossed
But I feel so close to everything that we lost
We'll never, we'll never have to lose it again

Now I bid you farewell, I don't know when I'll be back
They're moving us tomorrow to that tower down the track
But you'll be hearing from me baby, long after I'm gone
I'll be speaking to you sweetly
From a window in the Tower of Song

Yeah my friends are gone and my hair is grey
I ache in the places where I used to play
And I'm crazy for love but I'm not coming on
I'm just paying my rent every day
Oh in the Tower of Song

"The Future"

Give me back my broken night
My mirrored room, my secret life
It's lonely here
There's no one left to torture
Give me absolute control
Over every living soul
And lie beside me, baby
That's an order
Give me crack and anal sex
Take the only tree that's left
And stuff it up the hole
In your culture
Give me back the Berlin wall
Give me Stalin and St Paul
I've seen the future, brother
It is murder

Things are going to slide, slide in all directions
Won't be nothing
Nothing you can measure anymore
The blizzard, the blizzard of the world
Has crossed the threshold
And it has overturned
The order of the soul
When they said REPENT REPENT
I wonder what they meant
When they said REPENT REPENT
I wonder what they meant
When they said REPENT REPENT
I wonder what they meant

You don't know me from the wind
You never will, you never did
I'm the little Jew
Who wrote the Bible
I've seen the nations rise and fall
I've heard their stories, heard them all
But love's the only engine of survival
Your servant here, he has been told
To say it clear, to say it cold
It's over, it ain't going
Any further
And now the wheels of heaven stop
You feel the devil's riding crop
Get ready for the future
It is murder

Things are going to slide

There'll be the breaking of the ancient
Western code
Your private life will suddenly explode
There'll be phantoms
There'll be fires on the road
And the white man dancing
You'll see your woman
Hanging upside down
Her features covered by her fallen gown
And all the lousy little poets
Coming round
Tryin' to sound like Charlie Manson
And the white man dancin'

Give me back the Berlin wall
Give me Stalin and St Paul
Give me Christ
Or give me Hiroshima
Destroy another fetus now
We don't like children anyhow
I've seen the future, baby
It is murder

Things are going to slide

When they said repent repent

"Waiting For The Miracle"

Baby, I've been waiting, 
I've been waiting night and day. 
I didn't see the time, 
I waited half my life away. 
There were lots of invitations 
and I know you sent me some, 
but I was waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 
I know you really loved me. 
but, you see, my hands were tied. 
I know it must have hurt you, 
it must have hurt your pride 
to have to stand beneath my window 
with your bugle and your drum, 
and me I'm up there waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 

Ah I don't believe you'd like it, 
You wouldn't like it here. 
There ain't no entertainment 
and the judgements are severe. 
The Maestro says it's Mozart 
but it sounds like bubble gum 
when you're waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 

Waiting for the miracle 
There's nothing left to do. 
I haven't been this happy 
since the end of World War II. 

Nothing left to do 
when you know that you've been taken. 
Nothing left to do 
when you're begging for a crumb 
Nothing left to do 
when you've got to go on waiting 
waiting for the miracle to come. 

I dreamed about you, baby. 
It was just the other night. 
Most of you was naked 
Ah but some of you was light. 
The sands of time were falling 
from your fingers and your thumb, 
and you were waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come 

Ah baby, let's get married, 
we've been alone too long. 
Let's be alone together. 
Let's see if we're that strong. 
Yeah let's do something crazy, 
something absolutely wrong 
while we're waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come. 

Nothing left to do ... 

When you've fallen on the highway 
and you're lying in the rain, 
and they ask you how you're doing 
of course you'll say you can't complain -- 
If you're squeezed for information, 
that's when you've got to play it dumb 
You just say you're out there waiting 
for the miracle, for the miracle to come.

"Be For Real"

Are you back in my life to stay 
Or is it just for today 
Oh that you're gonna need me 
If it's a thrill you're looking for 
Honey, I'm flexible. Oh, yeah. 
Just be for real won't you, Baby 
Be for real oh, Baby 
You see I, I don't want to be hurt by love again 

So you see I'm not naive. 
I just would like to believe 
Ah what you tell me. 
So don't give me the world today 
And tomorrow take it away. 
Don't do that to me, darling. 

Just be for real won't you, Baby 
Be for real won't you, Baby 

Been hurt so many times 
You see I, I don't want to be hurt by love again. 

(I don't give a damn about the truth, Baby 
Except for the naked truth. Oh yeah) 

Just be for real won't you, Baby 
Be for real won't you, Baby 

No, no, no, no 
It's just that I, I don't want to be hurt by love again. 

Thanks for the song Mr. Knight.

"Closing Time"

Ah we're drinking and we're dancing 
and the band is really happening 
and the Johnny Walker wisdom running high 
And my very sweet companion 
she's the Angel of Compassion 
she's rubbing half the world against her thigh 
And every drinker every dancer 
lifts a happy face to thank her 
the fiddler fiddles something so sublime 
all the women tear their blouses off 
and the men they dance on the polka-dots 
and it's partner found, it's partner lost 
and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops 
it's CLOSING TIME 
Yeah the women tear their blouses off 
and the men they dance on the polka-dots 
and it's partner found, it's partner lost 
and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops 
it's CLOSING TIME 

Ah we're lonely, we're romantic 
and the cider's laced with acid 
and the Holy Spirit's crying, "Where's the beef" 
And the moon is swimming naked 
and the summer night is fragrant 
with a mighty expectation of relief 
So we struggle and we stagger 
down the snakes and up the ladder 
to the tower where the blessed hours chime 
and I swear it happened just like this 
a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss 
the Gates of Love they budged an inch 
I can't say much has happened since 
but CLOSING TIME 

I swear it happened just like this 
a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss 
the Gates of Love they budged an inch 
I can't say much has happened since 
CLOSING TIME 

I loved you for your beauty 
but that doesn't make a fool of me 
you were in it for your beauty too 
and I loved you for your body 
there's a voice that sounds like God to me 
declaring, declaring, declaring that your body's really you 
And I loved you when our love was blessed 
and I love you now there's nothing left 
but sorrow and a sense of overtime 
and I missed you since the place got wrecked 
And I just don't care what happens next 
looks like freedom but it feels like death 
it's something in between, I guess 
it's CLOSING TIME 

Yeah I missed you since the place got wrecked 
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex 
looks like freedom but it feels like death 
it's something in between, I guess 
it's CLOSING TIME 

Yeah we're drinking and we're dancing 
but there's nothing really happening 
and the place is dead as Heaven on a Saturday night 
And my very close companion 
gets me fumbling gets me laughing 
she's a hundred but she's wearing 
something tight 
and I lift my glass to the Awful Truth 
which you can't reveal to the Ears of Youth 
except to say it isn't worth a dime 
And the whole damn place goes crazy twice 
and it's once for the devil and once for Christ 
but the Boss don't like these dizzy heights 
we're busted in the blinding lights, 
busted in the blinding lights 
of CLOSING TIME 

The whole damn place goes crazy twice 
and it's once for the devil and once for Christ 
but the Boss don't like these dizzy heights 
we're busted in the blinding lights, 
busted in the blinding lights 
of CLOSING TIME 

Oh the women tear their blouses off 
and the men they dance on the polka-dots 
It's CLOSING TIME 
And it's partner found, it's partner lost 
and it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops 
It's CLOSING TIME 
I swear it happened just like this 
a sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss 
It's CLOSING TIME 
The Gates of Love they budged an inch 
I can't say much has happened since 
But CLOSING TIME 
I loved you when our love was blessed 
I love you now there's nothing left 
But CLOSING TIME 
I miss you since the place got wrecked 
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex.

"Anthem"

The birds they sang 
At the break of day 
Start again 
I heard them say 
Don't dwell on what 
Has passed away 
Or what is yet to be. 
Ah the wars they will 
Be fought again 
The holy dove 
She will be caught again 
Bought and sold 
And bought again 
The dove is never free. 

Ring the bells that still can ring 
Forget your perfect offering 
There is a crack a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in. 

We asked for signs 
The signs were sent 
The birth betrayed 
The marriage spent 
Yeah the widowhood 
Of every government
Signs for all to see. 

I can run no more 
With that lawless crowd 
While the killers in high places 
Say their prayers out loud. 
But they've summoned, they've summoned up 
A thundercloud 
They're gonna hear from me. 

Ring ring ring ring ring 

Ring the bells that still can ring 
Forget your perfect offering 
There is a crack a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in 

You can add up the parts 
But you won't have the sum 
You can strike up the march, 
There is no drum 
Every heart, every heart 
To love will come 
But like a refugee. 

Ring the bells that still can ring 
Forget your perfect offering 
There is a crack, a crack in everything 
That's how the light gets in. 

Ring the bells that still can ring 
Forget your perfect offering 
There is a crack, a crack in everything 
That's how the light gets in. 
That's how the light gets in. 
That's how the light gets in.

"Democracy"

It's coming through a hole in the air, 
from those nights in Tiananmen Square. 
It's coming from the feel 
that this ain't exactly real, 
or it's real, but it ain't exactly there. 
From the wars against disorder, 
from the sirens night and day, 
from the fires of the homeless, 
from the ashes of the gay 
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 
It's coming through a crack in the wall 
on a visionary flood of alcohol 
from the staggering account 
of the Sermon on the Mount 
which I don't pretend to understand at all. 
It's coming from the silence 
on the dock of the bay, 
from the brave, the bold, the battered 
heart of Chevrolet 
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 

It's coming from the sorrow in the street, 
the holy places where the races meet 
from the homicidal bitchin' 
that goes down in every kitchen 
to determine who will serve and who will eat. 
From the wells of disappointment 
where the women kneel to pray 
for the grace of God in the desert here 
and the desert far away 
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 

Sail on, sail on 
O mighty Ship of State 
To the Shores of Need 
Past the Reefs of Greed 
Through the Squalls of Hate 
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on. 

It's coming to America first, 
the cradle of the best and of the worst. 
It's here they got the range 
and the machinery for change 
and it's here they got the spiritual thirst. 
It's here the family's broken 
and it's here the lonely say 
that the heart has got to open 
in a fundamental way 
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 

It's coming from the women and the men. 
O baby, we'll be making love again. 
We'll be going down so deep 
the river's going to weep, 
and the mountain's going to shout Amen 
It's coming like the tidal flood 
beneath the lunar sway, 
imperial, mysterious, 
in amorous array 
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A. 

Sail on, sail on ... 

I'm sentimental, if you know what I mean 
I love the country but I can't stand the scene. 
And I'm neither left or right 
I'm just staying home tonight, 
getting lost in that hopeless little screen. 
But I'm stubborn as those garbage bags 
that Time cannot decay, 
I'm junk but I'm still holding up 
this little wild bouquet 
Democracy is coming to the U.S.A.

"Light As The Breeze"

She stands before you naked 
you can see it, you can taste it, 
and she comes to you light as the breeze. 
Now you can drink it or you can nurse it, 
it don't matter how you worship 
as long as you're 
down on your knees. 
So I knelt there at the delta, 
at the alpha and the omega, 
at the cradle of the river and the seas. 
And like a blessing come from heaven 
for something like a second 
I was healed and my heart 
was at ease. 

O baby I waited 
so long for your kiss 
for something to happen, 
oh something like this. 

And you're weak and you're harmless 
and you're sleeping in your harness 
and the wind going wild 
in the trees, 
and it ain't exactly prison 
but you'll never be forgiven 
for whatever you've done 
with the keys. 

O baby I waited ... 

It's dark now and it's snowing 
O my love I must be going, 
The river has started to freeze. 
And I'm sick of pretending 
I'm broken from bending 
I've lived too long on my knees. 

Then she dances so graceful 
and your heart's hard and hateful 
and she's naked 
but that's just a tease. 
And you turn in disgust 
from your hatred and from your love 
and comes to you 
light as the breeze. 

O baby I waited ... 

There's blood on every bracelet 
you can see it, you can taste it, 
and it's Please baby 
please baby please. 
And she says, Drink deeply, pilgrim 
but don't forget there's still a woman 
beneath this 
resplendent chemise. 

So I knelt there at the delta, 
at the alpha and the omega, 
I knelt there like one who believes. 
And the blessings come from heaven 
and for something like a second 
I'm cured and my heart 
is at ease

"Always"

(Oh friends, .. don't matter if you're a man or a woman. If you're in love 
with somebody, these are the words that you got to learn to say. Now 
listen carefully. Here it comes...) 
I'll be loving you always 
with a love that's true, always 
When the thing you've planned 
needs my helping hand, 
I will understand, always, always 

Days may not be fair, always 
Yeah but that's when I'll be there, always 
Not for just an hour, 
Not for just a day, 
Not for just a year, but always. 

I said that I'll be loving you, always 
with a love that's true, always. 
When the thing you've planned 
needs my helping hand, 
I will, I will understand, always, always 

(Oh that's pretty ... that's pretty too ... Oh darling) 

The days may not be fair, always 
Yeah but that's when I'll be there, always 
Not for just a second, or a minute, or an hour, 
Not for just a weekend and a shake down in the shower, 
Not for just the summer and the winter going sour, 
But always, always, always 

(Ok if you don't want to quit, let's try it one more time) 

I'll be loving you, always 
with a love that's true, always. 
When the thing you've planned 
needs my helping hand, 
I will understand, I will, I will understand, always, always 

The days may not be fair, always 
(Don't worry, baby) 
That's when I'll be there, always 
Not for just an hour, 
Not for just a day, 
Not for just a year, but always.

"In My Secret Life"

I saw you this morning
You were moving so fast
Can't seem to loosen my grip
On the past
And I miss you so much
There's no one in sight
And we're still making love
In My Secret Life

I smile when I'm angry
I cheat and I lie
I do what I have to do
To get by
But I know what is wrong
And I know what is right
And I'd die for the truth
In My Secret Life

Hold on, hold on, my brother
My sister, hold on tight
I finally got my orders
I'll be marching through the morning
Marching through the night
Moving cross the borders
Of My Secret Life

Looked through the paper
Makes you want to cry
Nobody cares if the people
Live or die
And the dealer wants you thinking
That it's either black or white
Thank God it's not that simple
In My Secret Life

I bite my lip
I buy what I'm told
From the latest hit
To the wisdom of old
But I'm always alone
And my heart is like ice
And it's crowded and cold
In My Secret Life

"A Thousand Kisses Deep"

The ponies run, the girls are young,
The odds are there to beat.
You win a while, and then its done 
Your little winning streak.
And summoned now to deal
With your invincible defeat,
You live your life as if its real,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

Im turning tricks, Im getting fixed,
Im back on Boogie Street.
You lose your grip, and then you slip
Into the Masterpiece.
And maybe I had miles to drive,
And promises to keep
You ditch it all to stay alive,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

And sometimes when the night is slow,
The wretched and the meek,
We gather up our hearts and go,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

Confined to sex, we pressed against
The limits of the sea
I saw there were no oceans left
For scavengers like me.
I made it to the forward deck.
I blessed our remnant fleet 
And then consented to be wrecked,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

Im turning tricks, Im getting fixed,
Im back on Boogie Street.
I guess they wont exchange the gifts
That you were meant to keep.
And quiet is the thought of you,
The file on you complete,
Except what we forgot to do,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

And sometimes when the night is slow,
The wretched and the meek,
We gather up our hearts and go,
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

The ponies run, the girls are young, 
The odds are there to beat . . .

"That Don't Make It Junk"

I fought against the bottle,
But I had to do it drunk 
Took my diamond to the pawnshop 
But that dont make it junk.

I know that Im forgiven,
But I dont know how I know
I dont trust my inner feelings 
Inner feelings come and go.

How come you called me here tonight
How come you bother
With my heart at all
You raise me up in grace,
Then you put me in a place,
Where I must fall.

Too late to fix another drink 
The lights are going out 
Ill listen to the darkness sing 
I know what thats about.

I tried to love you my way,
But I couldnt make it hold.
So I closed the Book of Longing
And I do what I am told.

How come you called me here tonight
How come you bother with my heart at all
You raise me up in grace,
Then you put me in a place,
Where I must fall.

I fought against the bottle,
But I had to do it drunk 
Took my diamond to the pawnshop 
But that dont make it junk.

"Here It Is"

Here is your crown
And your seal and rings
And here is your love
For all things.

Here is your cart,
And your cardboard and piss
And here is your love
For all of this.

May everyone live,
And may everyone die.
Hello, my love,
And my love, Goodbye.

Here is your wine,
And your drunken fall
And here is your love.
Your love for it all.

Here is your sickness.
Your bed and your pan
And here is your love
For the woman, the man.

May everyone live,
And may everyone die.
Hello, my love,
And, my love, Goodbye.

And here is the night,
The night has begun
And here is your death
In the heart of your son.

And here is the dawn,
(Until death do us part)
And here is your death,
In your daughters heart.

May everyone live,
And may everyone die.
Hello, my love,
And, my love, Goodbye.

And here you are hurried,
And here you are gone
And here is the love,
That its all built upon.

Here is your cross,
Your nails and your hill
And here is your love,
That lists where it will

May everyone live,
And may everyone die.
Hello, my love,
And my love, Goodbye.

"Love Itself"

The light came through the window,
Straight from the sun above,
And so inside my little room
There plunged the rays of Love.

In streams of light I clearly saw
The dust you seldom see,
Out of which the Nameless makes
A Name for one like me.

Ill try to say a little more
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door 
Then Love Itself
Love Itself was gone.

All busy in the sunlight
The flecks did float and dance,
And I was tumbled up with them
In formless circumstance.

Ill try to say a little more
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door 
Then Love Itself
Love Itself was gone.

Then I came back from where Id been.
My room, it looked the same 
But there was nothing left between
The Nameless and the Name.

All busy in the sunlight
The flecks did float and dance,
And I was tumbled up with them
In formless circumstance.

Ill try to say a little more
Love went on and on
Until it reached an open door 
Then Love itself,
Love Itself was gone.
Love Itself was gone.

"By The Rivers Dark"

By the rivers dark
I wandered on.
I lived my life
in Babylon.

And I did forget
My holy song
And I had no strength
In Babylon.

By the rivers dark
Where I could not see
Who was waiting there
Who was hunting me.

And he cut my lip
And he cut my heart.
So I could not drink
From the river dark.

And he covered me,
And I saw within,
My lawless heart
And my wedding ring,

I did not know
And I could not see
Who was waiting there,
Who was hunting me.

By the rivers dark
I panicked on.
I belonged at last
to Babylon.

Then he struck my heart
With a deadly force,
And he said, This heart
It is not yours.

And he gave the wind
My wedding ring
And he circled us
With everything.

By the rivers dark,
In a wounded dawn,
I live my life
In Babylon.

Though I take my song
From a withered limb,
Both song and tree,
They sing for him.

Be the truth unsaid
And the blessing gone,
If I forget
My Babylon.

I did not know 
And I could not see
Who was waiting there,
Who was hunting me.

By the rivers dark, 
Where it all goes on
By the rivers dark
In Babylon.

"Alexandra Leaving"

Suddenly the night has grown colder
The god of love preparing to depart
Alexandra hoisted on his shoulder
They slip between the sentries of the heart

Upheld by the simplicities of pleasure
They gain the light, they formlessly entwine
And radiant beyond your widest measure
They fall among the voices and the wine

Its not a trick, your senses all deceiving
A fitful dream, the morning will exhaust 
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for this to happen
Go firmly to the window. Drink it in
Exquisite music. Alexandra laughing
Your first commitments tangible again

And you who had the honor of her evening
And by that honor had your own restored 
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Alexandra leaving with her lord

Even though she sleeps upon your satin
Even though she wakes you with a kiss
Do not say the moment was imagined
Do not stoop to strategies like this

As someone long prepared for the occasion
In full command of every plan you wrecked 
Do not choose a cowards explanation
that hides behind the cause and the effect

And you who were bewildered by a meaning
Whose code was broken, crucifix uncrossed 
Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

Say goodbye to Alexandra leaving
Then say goodbye to Alexandra lost

"You Have Loved Enough"

I said Id be your lover.
You laughed at what I said.
I lost my job forever.
I was counted with the dead.

I swept the marble chambers,
But you sent me down below.
You kept me from believing
Until you let me know

That I am not the one who loves 
Its love that seizes me.
When hatred with his package comes,
You forbid delivery.

And when the hunger for your touch 
Rises from the hunger,
You whisper, "You have loved enough,
Now let me be the Lover."

I swept the marble chambers,
But you sent me down below.
You kept me from believing
Until you let me know

That I am not the one who loves 
Its love that chooses me.
When hatred with his package comes,
You forbid delivery.

And when the hunger for your touch
Rises from the hunger . . .

"Boogie Street"

O Crown of Light, O Darkened One,
I never thought wed meet.
You kiss my lips, and then its done
Im back on Boogie Street.

A sip of wine, a cigarette,
And then its time to go.
I tidied up the kitchenette
I tuned the old banjo.
Im wanted at the traffic-jam.
Theyre saving me a seat.
Im what I am, and what I am,
Is back on Boogie Street.

And O my love, I still recall
The pleasures that we knew
The rivers and the waterfall,
Wherein I bathed with you.
Bewildered by your beauty there,
Id kneel to dry your feet.
By such instructions you prepare
A man for Boogie Street.

O Crown of Light, O Darkened One

So come, my friends, be not afraid.
We are so lightly here.
It is in love that we are made
In love we disappear.
Tho all the maps of blood and flesh
Are posted on the door,
Theres no one who has told us yet
What Boogie Street is for.

O Crown of Light, O Darkened One,
I never thought wed meet.
You kiss my lips, and then its done
Im back on Boogie Street.

A sip of wine, a cigarette,
And then its time to go . . .

"The Land Of Plenty"

Dont really know who sent me
To raise my voice and say
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day.

I dont know why I come here,
Knowing as I do,
What you really think of me,
What I really think of you.

For the millions in a prison,
That wealth has set apart 
For the Christ who has not risen,
From the caverns of the heart 

For the innermost decision,
That we cannot but obey -
For whats left of our religion,
I lift my voice and pray
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day.

I know I said Id meet you,
Id meet you at the store,
But I cant buy it, baby.
I cant buy it anymore.

And I dont really know who sent me,
To raise my voice and say
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day.

I dont know why I come here,
knowing as I do,
what you really think of me,
what I really think of you.

For the innermost decision
That we cannot but obey
For whats left of our religion
I lift my voice and pray
May the lights in The Land of Plenty
Shine on the truth some day.

"Go No More A-Roving"

[Dedicated to Irving Layton]

So we'll go no more a-roving
So late into the night,
Though the heart be still as loving,
And the moon be still as bright.
For the sword outwears its sheath,
And the soul outwears the breast,
And the heart must pause to breathe,
And love itself have rest.
Though the night was made for loving,
And the day returns too soon,
Yet we'll go no more a-roving
By the light of the moon.

"Because Of"

Because of a few songs
Wherein I spoke of their mystery,
Women have been
Exceptionally kind
to my old age.
They make a secret place
In their busy lives
And they take me there.
They become naked
In their different ways
and they say,
"Look at me, Leonard
Look at me one last time."
Then they bend over the bed
And cover me up
Like a baby that is shivering.

"The Letters"

You never liked to get
The letters that I sent.
But now you've got the gist
Of what my letters meant.
You're reading them again,
The ones you didn't burn.
You press them to your lips,
My pages of concern.
I said there'd been a flood.
I said there's nothing left.
I hoped that you would come.
I gave you my address.
Your story was so long,
The plot was so intense,
It took you years to cross
The lines of self-defense.
The wounded forms appear
The loss, the full extent
And simple kindness here,
The solitude of strength.
You walk into my room.
You stand there at my desk,
Begin your letter to
The one who's coming next.

"Undertow"

I set out one night
When the tide was low
There were signs in the sky
But I did not know
I'd be caught in the grip
Of the undertow
Ditched on a beach
Where the sea hates to go
With a child in my arms
And a chill in my soul
And my heart the shape
Of a begging bowl

"Morning Glory"

No words this time
No words.
No, there are times when nothing can be done.
Not this time.
Is it censorship
Is it censorship
No, it's evaporation.
No, it's evaporation.
Is this leading somewhere
Yes.
We're going down the lane.
Is this going somewhere
Into the garden.
Into the backyard.
We're walking down the driveway.
Are we moving towards....
We're in the backyard.
...some transcendental moment
It's almost light.
That's right. 
That's it.
Are we moving towards some transcendental moment
That's right.
That's it.
Do you think you'll be able to pull it off
Yes. Do you think you can pull it off
Yes, it might happen.
I'm all ears.
I'm all ears.
Oh the morning glory

"On That Day"

Some people say
It's what we deserve
For sins against g-d
For crimes in the world
I wouldn't know
I'm just holding the fort
Since that day
They wounded New York
Some people say
They hate us of old
Our women unveiled
Our slaves and our gold
I wouldn't know
I'm just holding the fort
But answer me this
I won't take you to court
Did you go crazy
Or did you report
On that day
On that day
They wounded New York

"Villanelle For Our Time"

From bitter searching of the heart,
Quickened with passion and with pain
We rise to play a greater part.
This is the faith from which we start
Men shall know commonwealth again
From bitter searching of the heart.
We loved the easy and the smart,
But now, with keener hand and brain,
We rise to play a greater part.
The lesser loyalties depart,
And neither race nor creed remain
From bitter searching of the heart.
Not steering by the venal chart
That tricked the mass for private gain,
We rise to play a greater part.
Reshaping narrow law and art
Whose symbols are the millions slain,
From bitter searching of the heart
We rise to play a greater part.

"There For You"

When it all went down
And the pain came through
I get it now
I was there for you
Don't ask me how
I know it's true
I get it now
I was there for you
I make my plans
Like I always do
But when I look back
I was there for you
I walk the streets
Like I used to do
And I freeze with fear
But I'm there for you
I see my life
In full review
It was never me
It was always you
You sent me here
You sent me there
Breaking things
I can't repair
Making objects
Out of thoughts
Making more
By thinking not
Eating food
And drinking wine
A body that
I thought was mine
Dressed as Arab
Dressed as Jew
O mask of iron
I was there for you
Moods of glory
Moods so foul
The world comes through
A bloody towel
And death is old
But it's always new
I freeze with fear
And I'm there for you
I see it clear
I always knew
It was never me
I was there for you
I was there for you
My darling one
And by your law
It all was done

"Dear Heather"

Dear Heather
Please walk by me again
With a drink in your hand
And your legs all white
From the winter

"Nightingale"

[Dedicated to Carl Anderson (1945-2004)]

I built my house beside the wood
So I could hear you singing
And it was sweet and it was good
And love was all beginning
Fare thee well my nightingale
'Twas long ago I found you
Now all your songs of beauty fail
The forest closes 'round you
The sun goes down behind a veil
'Tis now that you would call me
So rest in peace my nightingale
Beneath your branch of holly
Fare thee well my nightingale
I lived but to be near you
Tho' you are singing somewhere still
I can no longer hear you

"To A Teacher"

[Dedicated to A. M. Klein (1909-1972)]

Hurt once and for all into silence.
A long pain ending without a song to prove it.
Who could stand beside you so close to Eden,
When you glinted in every eye the held-high
razor, shivering every ram and son
And now the silent loony bin, where
The shadows live in the rafters like
Day-weary bats,
Until the turning mind, a radar signal,
lures them to exaggerate
Mountain-size on the white stone wall
Your tiny limp.
How can I leave you in such a house
Are there no more saints and wizards
to praise their ways with pupils,
No more evil to stun with the slap
of a wet red tongue
Did you confuse the Messiah in a mirror
and rest because he had finally come
Let me cry Help beside you, Teacher.
I have entered under this dark roof
As fearlessly as an honoured son
Enters his father's house.

"The Faith"

[Based on a Quebec folk song]

The sea so deep and blind
The sun, the wild regret
The club, the wheel, the mind,
O love, aren't you tired yet
The club, the wheel, the mind
O love, aren't you tired yet
The blood, the soil, the faith
These words you can't forget
Your vow, your holy place
O love, aren't you tired yet
The blood, the soil, the faith
O love, aren't you tired yet
A cross on every hill
A star, a minaret
So many graves to fill
O love, aren't you tired yet
So many graves to fill
O love, aren't you tired yet
The sea so deep and blind
Where still the sun must set
And time itself unwind
O love, aren't you tired yet
And time itself unwind
O love, aren't you tired yet

"Tennessee Waltz (Live)"

I was dancing with my darlin'
to the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to see
Introduced him to my loved one
and while they were waltzing
My friend stole my sweetheart from me.
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
Now I know just how much I have lost
Yes I lost my little darlin'
The night they were playing
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz.
She comes dancing through the darkness
To the Tennessee Waltz
And I feel like I'm falling apart
And it's stronger than drink
And it's deeper than sorrow
This darkness she's left in my heart.

"Going Home"

I'd love to speak with Leonard
He's a sportsman and a shepherd
He's a lazy bastard
Living in a suit

But he does say what I tell him
Even though it isn't welcome
He just doesn't have the freedom
To refuse

He will speak these words of wisdom
Like a sage, a man of vision
Though he knows he's really nothing
But the brief elaboration of a tube

Going home without my sorrow
Going home sometime tomorrow
Going home to where it's better
Than before

Going home without my burden
Going home behind the curtain
Going home without this costume
That I wore

He wants to write a love song
An anthem of forgiving
A manual for living
With defeat

A cry above the suffering
A sacrifice recovering
But that isn't what I need him
To complete

I want him to be certain
That he doesn't have a burden
That he doesn't need a vision
That he only has permission
To do my instant bidding which is to
Say what I have told him to repeat

Going home without my sorrow
Going home sometime tomorrow
Going home to where it's better than before

Going home without my burden
Going home behind the curtain
Going home without the costume that I wore

I'm going home without my sorrow
Going home sometime tomorrow
Going home to where it's better than before

Going home without my burden
Going home behind the curtain
Going home without this costume that I wore

I love to speak with Leonard
He's a sportsman and a shepherd
He's a lazy bastard living in a suit

"Amen"

Tell me again
When I've been to the river
And I've taken the edge off my thirst
Tell me again
We're alone and I'm listening
I'm listening so hard that it hurts
Tell me again
When I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again
When I've seen through the horror
Tell me again
Tell me over and over
Tell me that you want me then
Amen...

Tell me again
When the victims are singing
And the Laws of Remorse are restored
Tell me again
That you know what I'm thinking
But vengeance belongs to the Lord
Tell me again
When I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again
When I've seen through the horror
Tell me again
Tell me over and over
Tell me that you love me then
Amen...

Tell me again
When the day has been ransomed
And the night has no right to begin
Try me again
When the angels are panting
And scratching at the door to come in
Tell me again
When I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again
When I've seen through the horror
Tell me again
Tell me over and over
Tell me that you need me then
Amen...

Tell me again
When the filth of the butcher
Is washed in the blood of the lamb
Tell me again
When the rest of the culture
Has passed through the Eye of the Camp
Tell me again
When I'm clean and I'm sober
Tell me again
When I've seen through the horror
Tell me again
Tell me over and over
Tell me that you love me then
Amen...

"Show Me The Place"

Show me the place where you want your slave to go
Show me the place I've forgotten I don't know
Show me the place where my head is bendin' low
Show me the place where you want your slave to go

Show me the place, help me roll away the stone
Show me the place, I can't move this thing alone
Show me the place where the word became a man
Show me the place where the suffering began

The troubles came I saved what I could save
A thread of light, a particle, a wave
But there were chains, so I hastened to behave
There were chains, so I loved you like a slave

Show me the place where you want your slave to go
Show me the place I've forgotten I don't know
Show me the place where my head is bendin' low
Show me the place where you want your slave to go

The troubles came I saved what I could save
A thread of light, a particle, a wave
But there were chains, so I hastened to behave
There were chains, so I loved you like a slave

Show me the place
Show me the place
Show me the place

Show me the place, help me roll away the stone
Show me the place, I can't move this thing alone
Show me the place where the word became a man
Show me the place where the suffering began

"Darkness"

I caught the darkness
It was drinking from your cup
I caught the darkness
I'm drinking from your cup
I said Is this contagious
You said Just drink it up

I got no future
I know my days are few
The present's not that pleasant
Just a lot of things to do
I thought the past would last me
But the darkness got that too

I should have seen it coming
It was right behind your eyes
You were young and it was summer
I just had to take a dive
Winning you was easy
But darkness was the prize

I don't smoke no cigarette
I don't drink no alcohol
I ain't had much loving yet
But that's always been your call
Hey I don't miss it baby
I got no taste for anything at all

I used to love the rainbow
And I used to love the view
I loved the early morning
I'd pretend that it was new
But I caught the darkness baby
And I got it worse than you

I caught the darkness
It was drinking from your cup
I caught the darkness
I'm drinking from your cup
I said Is this contagious
You said Just drink it up

"Anyhow"

I know it really is a pity
The way you treat me now
I know you cant forgive me
But forgive me anyhow
The ending got so ugly
I even heard you say
You never ever loved me
But could you love me anyway

I dreamed about you baby
You were wearing half your dress
I know you have to hate me
But could you hate me less
I used up all my chances
And youll never take me back
But there aint no harm in asking
Could you cut me one more slack

Im naked and Im filthy
And theres sweat upon my brow
And both of us are guilty
Anyhow
Have mercy on me baby
After all I did confess
Even though you have to hate me
Could you hate me less

Its a shame and its a pity
I know you cant forgive me
The ending got so ugly
You never ever loved me
Dreamed about you baby
I know you have to hate me
Im naked and Im filthy
And both of us are guilty
Anyhow
Have mercy on me baby

"Crazy To Love You"

Had to go crazy to love you
Had to go down to the pit
Had to do time in the tower
Begging my crazy to quit

Had to go crazy to love you
You who were never the one
Whom I chased through the souvenir heartache
Her braids and her blouse all undone

Sometimes Id head for the highway
Im old and the mirrors dont lie
But crazy has places to hide in
That are deeper than any goodbye

Had to go crazy to love you
Had to let everything fall
Had to be people I hated
Had to be no one at all

Im tired of choosing desire
I been saved by a blessed fatigue
The gates of commitment unwired
And nobody trying to leave

Sometimes Id head for the highway
Im old and the mirrors dont lie
But crazy has places to hide in
That are deeper than any goodbye

Had to go crazy to love you
You who were never the one
Whom I chased through the souvenir heartache
Her braids and her blouse all undone

"Come Healing"

O gather up the brokenness
And bring it to me now
The fragrance of those promises
You never dared to vow

The splinters that you carry
The cross you left behind
Come healing of the body
Come healing of the mind

And let the heavens hear it
The penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb

Behold the gates of mercy
In arbitrary space
And none of us deserving
The cruelty or the grace

O solitude of longing
Where love has been confined
Come healing of the body
Come healing of the mind

O see the darkness yielding
That tore the light apart
Come healing of the reason
Come healing of the heart

O troubled dust concealing
An undivided love
The Heart beneath is teaching
To the broken Heart above

O let the heavens falter
And let the earth proclaim
Come healing of the Altar
Come healing of the Name

O longing of the branches
To lift the little bud
O longing of the arteries
To purify the blood

And let the heavens hear it
The penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb

O let the heavens hear it
The penitential hymn
Come healing of the spirit
Come healing of the limb

"Banjo"

Theres something that Im watching
Means a lot to me
Its a broken banjo bobbing
On the dark infested sea

Dont know how it got there
Maybe taken by the wave
Off of someones shoulder
Or out of someones grave

Its coming for me darling
No matter where I go
Its duty is to harm me
My duty is to know

Theres something that Im watching
Means a lot to me
Its a broken banjo bobbing
On the dark infested sea

"Lullaby"

Sleep baby sleep
The days on the run
The wind in the trees
Is talking in tongues

If your heart is torn
I dont wonder why
If the night is long
Heres my lullaby
Heres my lullaby

Well the mouse ate the crumb
Then the cat ate the crust
Now theyve fallen in love
Theyre talking in tongues

If your heart is torn
I dont wonder why
If the night is long
Heres my lullaby
Heres my lullaby

Sleep baby sleep
Theres a morning to come
The wind in the trees
Theyre talking in tongues

If your heart is torn
I dont wonder why
If the night is long
Heres my lullaby
Heres my lullaby

"Different Sides"

We find ourselves on different sides
Of a line nobody drew
Though it all may be one in the higher eye
Down here where we live it is two

I to my side call the meek and the mild
You to your side call the Word
By virtue of suffering I claim to have won
You claim to have never been heard

Both of us say there are laws to obey
But frankly I dont like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
I want to leave it alone

The pull of the moon, the thrust of the sun
And thus the ocean is crossed
The waters are blessed while a shadowy guest
Kindles a light for the lost

Both of us say there are laws to obey
But frankly I dont like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
I want to leave it alone

Down in the valley the famine goes on
The famine up on the hill
I say that you shouldnt, you couldnt, you cant
You say that you must and you will

Both of us say there are laws to obey
But frankly I dont like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
I want to leave it alone

You want to live where the suffering is
I want to get out of town
Cmon baby give me a kiss
Stop writing everything down

Both of us say there are laws to obey
Yeah, but frankly I dont like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
I want to leave it alone

Both of us say there are laws to obey
But frankly I dont like your tone
You want to change the way I make love
I want to leave it alone

"Slow"

Im slowing down the tune
I never liked it fast
You want to get there soon
I want to get there last

Its not because Im old
Its not the life I led
I always liked it slow
Thats what my momma said

Im lacing up my shoe
But I dont want to run
Ill get here when I do
Dont need no starting gun

Its not because Im old
Its not what dying does
I always liked it slow
Slow is in my blood

I always liked it slow
I never liked it fast
With you its got to go
With me its got to last

Its not because Im old
Its not because Im dead
I always liked it slow
Thats what my momma said

All your moves are swift
All your turns are tight
Let me catch my breath
I thought we had all night

I like to take my time
I like to linger as it flies
A weekend on your lips
A lifetime in your eyes

I always liked it slow...

Im slowing down the tune
I never liked it fast
You want to get there soon
I want to get there last

So baby let me go
Youre wanted back in town
In case they want to know
Im just trying to slow it down

"Almost Like The Blues"

I saw some people starving
There was murder, there was rape
Their villages were burning
They were trying to escape
I couldn't meet their glances
I was staring at my shoes
It was acid, it was tragic
It was almost like the blues

I have to die a little
Between each murderous thought
And when I'm finished thinking
I have to die a lot
There's torture and there's killing
And there's all my bad reviews
The war, the children missing
Lord, it's almost like the blues

So I let my heart get frozen
To keep away the rot
My father says I'm chosen
My mother says I'm not
I listened to their story
Of the Gypsies and the Jews
It was good, it wasn't boring
It was almost like the blues

There is no God in Heaven
And there is no Hell below
So says the great professor
Of all there is to know
But I've had the invitation
That a sinner can't refuse
And it's almost like salvation
It's almost like the blues

"Samson In New Orleans"

You said that you were with me
You said you were my friend
Did you really love the city
Or did you just pretend

You said you loved her secrets
And her freedoms hid away
She was better than America
Thats what I heard you say

You said how could this happen
You said how can this be
The remnant all dishonored
On the bridge of misery

And we who cried for mercy
From the bottom of the pit
Was our prayer so damn unworthy
The Son rejected it

So gather up the killers
Get everyone in town
Stand me by those pillars
Let me take this temple down

The king so kind and solemn
He wears a bloody crown
So stand me by that column
Let me take this temple down

You said how could this happen
You said how can this be
The chains are gone from heaven
The storms are wild and free

Theres other ways to answer
That certainly is true
Me, Im blind with death and anger
And thats no place for you

Theres a woman in the window
And a bed in Tinsel Town
Ill write you when its over
Let me take this temple down

"A Street"

I used to be your favorite drunk
Good for one more laugh
Then we both ran out of luck
Luck was all we ever had
You put on a uniform
To fight the Civil War
You looked so good I didnt care
What side youre fighting for

It wasnt all that easy
When you up and walked away
But Ill save that little story
For another rainy day
I know the burdens heavy
As you wheel it through the night
Some people say its empty
But that dont mean its light

You left me with the dishes
And a baby in the bath
Youre tight with the militias
You wear their camouflage
You always said were equal
So let me march with you
Just an extra in the sequel
To the old red white and blue

Baby dont ignore me
We were smokers we were friends
Forget that tired story
Of betrayal and revenge
I see the Ghost of Culture
With numbers on his wrist
Salute some new conclusion
Which all of us have missed

I cried for you this morning
And Ill cry for you again
But Im not in charge of sorrow
So please dont ask me when
There may be wine and roses
And magnums of champagne
But well never no well never
Ever be that drunk again

The partys over
But Ive landed on my feet
Ill be standing on this corner
Where there used to be a street

"Did I Ever Love You"

Did I ever love you
Did I ever need you
Did I ever fight you
Did I ever want to

Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
Are we still leaning
Across the old table

Did I ever love you...

Was it ever settled
Was it ever over
And is it still raining
Back in November

The lemon trees blossom
The almond trees wither
Was I ever someone
Who could love you forever

Was it ever settled
Was it ever over
And is it still raining
Back in November

The lemon trees blossom
The almond trees wither
It's Spring and it's Summer
And it's Winter forever

Did I ever love you
Does it really matter
Did I ever fight you
You don't need to answer

Did I ever leave you
Was I ever able
Are we still leaning
Across the old table

Did I ever love you...

"My Oh My"

Wasnt hard to love you
Didnt have to try
Wasnt hard to love you
Didnt have to try
Held you for a little while
My Oh My Oh My

Drove you to the station
Never asked you why
Drove you to the station
Never asked you why
Held you for a little while
My Oh My Oh My

All the boys are waving
Trying to catch your eye
All the boys are waving
Trying to catch your eye
Held you for a little while
My Oh My Oh My

Wasnt hard to love you
Didnt have to try
Wasnt hard to love you
Didnt have to try
Held you for a little while
My Oh My Oh My

"Nevermind"

The war was lost
The treaty signed
I was not caught
I crossed the line

I was not caught
Though many tried
I live among you
Well disguised

I had to leave
My life behind
I dug some graves
You'll never find

The story's told
With facts and lies
I had a name
But never mind

Never mind
Never mind
The war was lost
The treaty signed

There's truth that lives
And truth that dies
I don't know which
So never mind

    
   

Your victory
Was so complete
That some among you
Thought to keep

A record of
Our little lives
The clothes we wore
Our spoons our knives

The games of luck
Our soldiers played
The stones we cut
The songs we made

Our law of peace
Which understands
A husband leads
A wife commands

And all of this
Expressions of
The Sweet Indifference
Some call Love

The High Indifference
Some call Fate
But we had Names
More intimate

Names so deep and
Names so true
They're blood to me
They're dust to you

There is no need
That this survive
There's truth that lives
And truth that dies

Never mind
Never mind
I live the life
I left behind

There's truth that lives
And truht that dies
I don't know which
So never mind

    
   

I could not kill
The way you kill
I could not hate
I tried I failed

You turned me in
At least you tried
You side with them
Whom you despise

This was your heart
This swarm of flies
This was once your mouth
This bowl of lies

You serve them well
I'm not surprised
You're of their kin
You're of their kind

Never mind
Never mind
I had to leave
My life behind
The story's told
With facts and lies
You own the world
So never mind

Never mind
Never mind
I live the life
I left behind

I live it full
I live it wide
Through layers of time
You can't divide

My woman's here
My children too
Their graves are safe
From ghosts like you

In places deep
With roots entwined
I live the life I left behind

The war was lost
The treaty signed
I was not caught
I crossed the line

I was not caught
Though many tried
I live among you
Well disguised

"Born In Chains"

[SHARON, HATTIE AND CHARLEY]
I was born...

[LEONARD]
I was born in chains but I was taken out of Egypt
I was bound to a burden, but the burden it was raised
Oh Lord I can no longer keep this secret
Blessed is the name, the name be praised.

[SHARON]
I fled to the edge of the mighty sea of sorrow
Pursued by the riders of a cruel and dark regime
But the waters parted and my soul crossed over
Out of Egypt, out of Pharaohs dream

[LEONARD]
Word of words and the measure of all measures
Blessed is the name, the name be blessed
Written on my heart in burning letters
Thats all I know, I do not know the rest

[HATTIE]
I was idle with my soul, when I heard that you could use me
I followed very closely, but my life remained the same
But then you showed me where you had been wounded
In every atom broken is the Name

[CHARLEY]
I was alone on the road, your love was so confusing
And all my teachers told me that I had myself to blame
But in the grip of sensual illusion
A sweet unknowing unified the name

[LEONARD]
Word of words, and the measure of all measures
Blessed is the name, the name be blessed
Written on my heart in burning letters
Thats all I know, I cannot read the rest

[LEONARD]
I've heard the soul unfolds in the chambers of its longing
And the bitter liquor sweetens in the hammered  cup
Ah but all the ladders of the night have fallen
Just darkness now, to lift the longing up

[LEONARD]
Word of words and measure of all measures
Blessed is the name, the name be blessed
Written on my heart in burning letters
Thats all I know, I cannot read the rest

[SHARON, HATTIE AND CHARLEY]
Just darkness now, to lift the spirit up

"You Got Me Singing"

You got me singing
Even tho' the news is bad
You got me singing
The only song I ever had

You got me singing
Ever since the river died
You got me thinking
Of the places we could hide

You got me singing
Even though the world is gone
You got me thinking
I'd like to carry on

You got me singing
Even tho' it all looks grim
You got me singing
The Hallelujah hymn

You got me singing
Like a prisoner in a jail
You got me singing
Like my pardon's in the mail

You got me wishing
Our little love would last
You got me thinking
Like those people of the past

You got me singing
Even though the world is gone
You got me thinking
I'd like to carry on

You got me singing
Even tho' it all went wrong
You got me singing
The Hallelujah song

"You Want It Darker"

If you are the dealer, I'm out of the game
If you are the healer, it means I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory then mine must be the shame
You want it darker
We kill the flame

Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name
Vilified, crucified, in the human frame
A million candles burning for the help that never came
You want it darker

Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my lord

There's a lover in the story
But the story's still the same
There's a lullaby for suffering
And a paradox to blame
But it's written in the scriptures
And it's not some idle claim
You want it darker
We kill the flame

They're lining up the prisoners
And the guards are taking aim
I struggled with some demons
They were middle class and tame
I didn't know I had permission to murder and to maim
You want it darker

Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my lord

Magnified, sanctified, be thy holy name
Vilified, crucified, in the human frame
A million candles burning for the love that never came
You want it darker
We kill the flame

If you are the dealer, let me out of the game
If you are the healer, I'm broken and lame
If thine is the glory, mine must be the shame
You want it darker

Hineni, hineni
Hineni, hineni
I'm ready, my lord

Hineni
Hineni, hineni
Hineni

"Treaty"

I've seen you change the water into wine
I've seen you change it back to water, too
I sit at your table every night
I try but I just don't get high with you
I wish there was a treaty we could sign
I do not care who takes this bloody hill
I'm angry and I'm tired all the time
I wish there was a treaty, I wish there was a treaty
Between your love and mine

Ah, they're dancing in the street  it's Jubilee
We sold ourselves for love but now we're free
I'm so sorry for that ghost I made you be
Only one of us was real and that was me

I haven't said a word since you been gone
That any liar couldn't say as well
I just can't believe the static coming on
You were my ground, my safe and sound
You were my aerial

Ah, the fields are crying out  it's Jubilee
We sold ourselves for love but now we're free
I'm so sorry for that ghost I made you be
Only one of us was real and that was me

I heard the snake was baffled by his sin
He shed his scales to find the snake within
But born again is born without a skin
The poison enters into everything

And I wish there was a treaty we could sign
I do not care who takes this bloody hill
I'm angry and I'm tired all the time
I wish there was a treaty, I wish there was a treaty
Between your love and mine

"On The Level"

I knew that it was wrong
I didn't have a doubt
I was dying to get back home
And you were starting out

I said I'd best be moving on
You said, we have all day
You smiled at me like I was young
It took my breath away

Your crazy fragrance all around
Your secrets all in view
My lost, my lost was saying found
My don't was saying do

Let's keep it on the level
When I walked away from you
I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too

They oughta give my heart a medal
For letting go of you
When I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too

Now I'm living in this temple
Where they tell you what to do
I'm old and I've had to settle
On a different point of view

I was fighting with temptation
But I didn't want to win
A man like me don't like to see
Temptation caving in

Your crazy fragrance all around
Your secrets in my view
My lost, my lost was saying found
My don't was saying do

Let's keep it on the level
When I walked away from you
I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too

They ought to give my heart a medal
For letting go of you
When I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too

They ought to give my heart a medal
For letting go of you
When I turned my back on the devil
Turned my back on the angel too

"Leaving The Table"

I'm leaving the table
I'm out of the game
I don't know the people
In your picture frame
If I ever loved you or no, no
It's a crying shame if I ever loved you
If I knew your name

You don't need a lawyer
I'm not making a claim
You don't need to surrender
I'm not taking aim
I don't need a lover, no, no
The wretched beast is tame
I don't need a lover
So blow out the flame

There's nobody missing
There is no reward
Little by little
We're cutting the cord
We're spending the treasure, oh, no, no
That love cannot afford
I know you can feel it
The sweetness restored

I don't need a reason
For what I became
I've got these excuses
They're tired and lame
I don't need a pardon, no, no, no, no, no
There's no one left to blame
I'm leaving the table
I'm out of the game

I'm leaving the table
I'm out of the game

"If I Didn't Have Your Love"

If the sun would lose its light
And we lived an endless night
And there was nothing left that you could feel
That's how it would be
What my life would seem to me
If I didn't have your love to make it real

If the stars were all unpinned
And a cold and bitter wind
Swallowed up the world without a trace
Ah, well that's where I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I couldn't lift the veil and see your face

And if no leaves were on the tree
And no water in the sea
And the break of day had nothing to reveal
That's how broken I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I didn't have your love to make it real

If the sun would lose its light
And we lived in an endless night
And there was nothing left that you could feel
If the sea were sand alone
And the flowers made of stone
And no one that you hurt could ever heal
Well that's how broken I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I didn't have your love to make it real

"Traveling Light"

I'm traveling light
It's au revoir
My once so bright, my fallen star
I'm running late, they'll close the bar
I used to play one mean guitar
I guess I'm just somebody who
Has given up on the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light like we used to do

Good night, good night, my fallen star
I guess you're right, you always are
I know you're right about the blues
You live some life you'd never choose
I'm just a fool, a dreamer who forgot to dream of the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light like we used to do

Traveling light
It's au revoir
My once so bright, my fallen star
I'm running late, they'll close the bar
I used to play one mean guitar
I guess I'm just somebody who
Has given up on the me and you
I'm not alone, I've met a few
Traveling light like we used to do

But if the road leads back to you
Must I forget the things I knew
When I was friends with one or two
Traveling light like we used to do
I'm traveling light

"It Seemed The Better Way"

It seemed the better way
When first I heard him speak
Now it's much too late
To turn the other cheek

Sounded like the truth
Seemed the better way
Sounded like the truth
But it's not the truth today

I wonder what it was
I wonder what it meant
First he touched on love
Then he touched on death

Sounded like the truth
Seemed the better way
Sounded like the truth
But it's not the truth today

I better hold my tongue
I better take my place
Lift this glass of blood
Try to say the grace

Seemed the better way
When first I heard him speak
But now it's much too late
To turn the other cheek

Sounded like the truth
Seemed the better way
Sounded like the truth
But it's not the truth today

I better hold my tongue
I better take my place
Lift this glass of blood
Try to say the grace

"Steer Your Way"

Steer your way past the ruins of the Altar and the Mall
Steer your way through the fables of Creation and The Fall
Steer your way past the Palaces that rise above the rot
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought

Steer your heart past the Truth that you believed in yesterday
Such as Fundamental Goodness and the Wisdom of the Way
Steer your heart, precious heart, past the women whom you bought
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought

Steer your way through the pain that is far more real than you
That smashed the Cosmic Model, that blinded every view
And please don't make me go there, though there be a God or not
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought

They whisper still, the ancient stones, the blunted mountains weep
As he died to make men holy, let us die to make things cheap
And say the Mea Culpa, which you probably forgot
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought

Steer your way, O my heart, though I have no right to ask
To the one who was never, never equal to the task
Who knows he's been convicted, who knows he will be shot
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought

They whisper still, the ancient stones, the blunted mountains weep
As he died to make men holy, let us die to make things cheap
And say your Mea Culpa, which you gradually forgot
Year by year, month by month, day by day
Thought by thought

"String Reprise  Treaty"

I wish there was a treaty we could sign
It's over now, the water and the wine
We were broken then but now we're borderline
And I wish there was a treaty, I wish there was a treaty between your love and mine

"Happens To The Heart"

I was always working steady
But I never called it art
I got my shit together
Meeting Christ and reading Marx
It failed my little fire
But it's bright the dying spark
Go tell the young messiah
What happens to the heart

There's a mist of summer kisses
Where I tried to double-park
The rivalry was vicious
The women were in charge
It was nothing, it was business
But it left an ugly mark
I've come here to revisit
What happens to the heart

I was selling holy trinkets
I was dressing kind of sharp
Had a pussy in the kitchen
And a panther in the yard

In the prison of the gifted
I was friendly with the guards
So I never had to witness
What happens to the heart

I should have seen it coming
After all I knew the chart
Just to look at her was trouble
It was trouble from the start
Sure we played a stunning couple
But I never liked the part
It ain't pretty, it ain't subtle
What happens to the heart

Now the angel's got a fiddle
The devil's got a harp
Every soul is like a minnow
Every mind is like a shark
I've broken every window
But the house, the house is dark
I care but very little
What happens to the heart

Then I studied with this beggar
He was filthy, he was scarred
By the claws of many women
He had failed to disregard
No fable here no lesson
No singing meadowlark
Just a filthy beggar guessing
What happens to the heart

I was always working steady
But I never called it art
It was just some old convention
Like the horse before the cart
I had no trouble betting
On the flood, against the ark
You see, I knew about the ending
What happens to the heart

I was handy with a rifle
My father's .303
I fought for something final
Not the right to disagree

"Moving On"

I loved your face I loved your hair
Your t-shirts and your evening-wear
As for the world the job the war
I ditched them all to love you more

And now you're gone, now you're gone
As if there ever was a you
Who broke the heart and made it new
Who's moving on, who's kiddin' who

I loved your moods I love the way
They threaten every single day
Your beauty ruled me though I knew
Twas more hormonal than the view

Now you're gone, now you're gone
As if there ever was a you
Queen of lilac, queen of blue
Who's moving on, who's kiddin' who

I loved your face I loved your hair
Your t-shirts and your evening-wear
As for the world the job the war
I ditched them all to love you more

And now you're gone, now you're gone
As if there ever was a you
Who held me dyin' pulled me through
Who's moving on, who's kiddin' who

Who's moving on, who's kiddin' who

"The Night Of Santiago"

She said she was a maiden
That wasn't what I heard
For the sake of conversation
I took her at her word
The lights went out behind us
The fireflies undressed
The broken sidewalk ended
I touched her sleeping breasts
They opened to me urgently
Likelilies from the dead
Behind a fine embroidery
Her nipples rose like bread
Then I took off my necktie
And she took off her dress
My belt and pistol set aside
We tore away the rest

The night of Santiago
And I was passing through
So I took her to the river
As any man would do

Her thighs they slipped away from me
Like schools of startled fish
Though I've forgotten half my life
I still remember this
Now, as a man I won't repeat
The things she said aloud
Except for this, my lips are sealed forever
And for now
And soon there's sand in every kiss
And soon the dawn is ready
And soon the night surrenders
To a daffodil machete
I gave her something pretty
And I waited till she laughed
I wasn't born a gypsy
To make a woman sad

The night of Santiago
And I was passing through
I took her to the river
As any man would do
The night of Santiago
And I was passing through
I took her to the river
As any man would do

I didn't fall in love of course
It's never up to you
But she was walking back and forth
And I was passing through
When I took her to the river
In her virginal apparel
When I took her to the river
On that night of Santiago
And yes she lied about it all
Her children and her husband
You were born to judge the world
Forgive me but I wasn't

The night of Santiago
And I was passing through
So I took her to the river
As any man would do

The night of Santiago
And I was passing through
So I took her to the river
As any man would do

The night of Santiago
And I was passing through
So I took her to the river
As any man would do

"Thanks For The Dance"

Thanks for the dance
I'm sorry you're tired
The evening has hardly begun

Thanks for the dance
Try to look inspired
One-two-three, one-two-three, one

There is a rose in your hair
Your shoulders are bare
You've been wearing this costume forever
So turn up the music
Pour out the wine
Stop at the surface
The surface is fine
We don't need to go any deeper

Thanks for the dance
I hear that we're married
One-two-three, one-two-three, one
Thanks for the dance
And the baby you carried
It was almost a daughter or a son

And there's nothing to do
But to wonder if you
Are as hopeless as me
And as decent
We're joined in the spirit
Joined at the hip
Joined in the panic
Wondering if
We've come to some sort
Of agreement

It was fine, it was fast
We were first, we were last
In line at the
Temple of Pleasure
But the green was so green
And the blue was so blue
I was so I
And you were so you
The crisis was light
As a feather

Thanks for the dance
It was hell, it was swell, it was fun
Thanks for all the dances
One-two-three, one-two-three, one

"It's Torn"

I see you in windows that open so wide
There's nothing beyond them and no one inside
You kick off your sandals and shake out your hair
The salt on your shoulders like sparks in the air
There's silt on your ankles and sand on your feet
The river too shallow, the ocean too deep
You smile at your suffering, the sweetest reprieve
Why did you leave us, why did you leave

You kick off your sandals and shake out your hair
It's torn where you're dancing, it's torn everywhere
It's torn on the right and it's torn on the left
It's torn in the center which few can accept

It's torn where there's beauty, it's torn where there's death
It's torn where there's mercy but torn somewhat less
It's torn in the highest from kingdom to crown
The messages fly but the network is down
Bruised at the shoulder and cut at the wrist
The sea rushes home to its thimble of mist
The opposites falter, the spirals reverse
And Eve must re-enter the sleep of her birth
And up through the system the worlds are withdrawn
From every dominion the mind stood upon
And now that it's over and now that it's done
The name has no number, not even the one

Come gather the pieces all scattered and lost
The lie in what's holy, the light in what's not
The story's been written the letter's been sealed
You gave me a lily but now it's a field

You kick off your sandals and shake out your hair
It's torn where you're dancing, it's torn everywhere

"The Goal"

I can't leave my house
Or answer the phone
I'm going down again
But I'm not alone

Settling at last
Accounts of the soul
This for the trash
That paid in full

As for the fall, it
Began long ago
Can't stop the rain
Can't stop the snow

I sit in my chair
I look at the street
The neighbor returns
My smile of defeat

I move with the leaves
I shine with the chrome
I'm almost alive
I'm almost at home

No one to follow
And nothing to teach
Except that the goal
Falls short of the reach

"Puppets"

German puppets burned the Jews
Jewish puppets did not choose
Puppet vultures eat the dead
Puppet corpses they are fed
Puppet winds and puppet waves
Puppet sailors in their graves
Puppet flower, puppet stem
Puppet time dismantles them
Puppet me and puppet you
Puppet German
Puppet Jew

Puppet Presidents command
Puppet troops to burn the land
Puppet fire, puppet flames
Feed on all the puppet names
Puppet lovers in their bliss
Turn away from all of this
Puppet reader shakes his head
Takes his puppet wife to bed
Puppet me and puppet you
Puppet German, puppet Jew

Puppet Presidents command
Puppet troops to burn the land
Puppet fire, puppet flames
Feed on all the puppet names
Puppet night comes down to play
The after act to puppet day

"The Hills"

I can't make the hills
The system is shot
I'm living on pills
For which I thank God

My animal howls
My angel's upset
But I'm not allowed
A trace of regret

For someone will use
The thing I could not be
My heart will be hers
Impersonally

She'll step on the path
She'll see what I mean
My will cut in half
And freedom between

For this in a second
Our lives will collide
The endless suspended
The door opened wide

And she will be born
To someone like you
What I left undone
She will certainly do

I know she is coming
And I know she will look
And that is the longing
And this is the hook

I can't make the hills
The system is shot
I'm living on pills
For which I thank God

My page was too white
My ink was too thinned
The day wouldn't write
But the night penciled in

But I know she's coming
And I know she will look
That is the longing
This is the hook

I know she is coming
And I know she will look
That is the longing
And this is the hook

I can't make the hills
The system is shot
I'm living on pills
For which I thank God

I sailed like a swan
I sank like a rock
But time is long gone
Past my laughing stock

I can't make the hills
The system is shot
I'm living on pills
For which I thank God

"Listen To The Hummingbird"

Listen to the hummingbird
Whose wings you cannot see
Listen to the hummingbird
Don't listen to me

Listen to the butterfly
Whose days but number three
Listen to the butterfly
Don't listen to me

Listen to the mind of God
Which doesn't need to be
Listen to the mind of God
Don't listen to me

Listen to the hummingbird
Whose wings you cannot see
Listen to the hummingbird
Don't listen to me

"Feels So Good"

Feels so good, not to love you like I did
Feels so good, not to love you like I did
It's like they tore away my blindfold and they said, we're gonna let this prisoner live
It's like they tore away my blindfold and they said, we're gonna let this prisoner live

Feels so good to wake up in the morning by myself
Cup of coffee in the kitchen, fire up a little danger to my health
Ah, they're selling freedom everywhere, it's flying off the shelf
Yeah, they're selling freedom everywhere but love, that's something else

Ah you drift into my dreams as if you had the right
And you show me how you broke me doing all the little things I really like
But I let it all go by just so long as you and I don't have to fight
Yeah, I let it all go by just so long as you and I don't have to fight

Well I don't know about tomorrow but I know what's coming next
I've used up all my questions I have no answers left
In a while I won't remember what I promised you I never would forget
In a while I won't remember what I promised you I never would forget

Feels so good not to wonder who you'll get
Who you love, who you touch and who you kiss
Oh baby, who'd ever guess that there's a side of loneliness as sweet as this
Would you ever guess that there's a side of loneliness as sweet as this

Feels so good not to love you like I did
Feels so good not to love you like I did
It's like they tore away my blindfold and they said, we're gonna let this prisoner live
It's like they tore away my blindfold and they said, we're gonna let this prisoner live

"Necropsy Of Love"

If it came about you died
It might be said I loved you
Love is an absolute as death is
And neither bears false witness to the other
But you remain alive

No, I do not love you
Hate the word
That private tyranny inside a public sound
Your freedom's yours and not my own
But hold my separate madness like a sword
And plunge it in your body all night long

If death shall strip our bones of all but bones
Then here's the flesh and flesh that's drunken-sweet
As wine cups in deceptive lunar light
Reach up your hand and turn the moonlight off
And maybe it was never there at all
So never promise anything to me
But reach across the darkness with your hand
Reach across the distance of tonight
And touch the moving moment once again
Before you fall asleep

"Never Gave Nobody Trouble"

Couldn't pay the mortgage
And it broke my baby's heart
I couldn't pay the mortgage
It broke my baby's heart
I never gave nobody trouble
But it ain't too late to start

Don't wanna break no window
Don't wanna burn no car
Don't wanna break no window
And I don't wanna burn your car
You got the right to all your riches
But you let it go too far

You sail the mighty ocean
On a yacht designed for you
You sail the mighty ocean
On a yacht designed for you
Yeah, but the ocean's thick with garbage
You ain't gonna make it through

[Solo]

I never gave nobody trouble
I'm a law and order man
I never gave nobody trouble
I'm a law and order man
I said, I never gave nobody trouble
But you know god damn well that I can

"Recitation"

You came to me this morning and you handled me like meat.
Youd have to be a man to know how good that feels, how sweet.
My mirrored twin, my next of kin, Id know you in my sleep and who but you would take me in, a thousand kisses deep.

I loved you when you opened like a lily to the heat, you see Im just another snowman standing in the rain and sleet, who loved you with his frozen love, his second hand physique, with all he is, and all he was,
A thousand kisses deep.

I know you had to lie to me, I know you had to cheat, to pose all hot and high behind the veils of shear deceit, our perfect porn aristocrat so elegant and cheap, Im old but Im still into that,
A thousand kisses deep.

Im good at love, Im good at hate, it' s in between I freeze.
Been working out, but its too late, its been to late for years.
But you look good, you really do, they love you on the street.
If you were here Id kneel for you,
a thousand kisses deep.

The autumn moved across your skin, got something in my eye, a light that doesnt need to live, and doesnt need to die.
A riddle in the book of love, obscure and obsolete, till witnessed here in time and blood,
A thousand kisses deep.

And I'm still working with the wine, still dancing cheek to cheek, the band is playing Auld Lang Syne, but the heart will not retreat.
I ran with Diz and I sang with Ray, I never had their sweep, but once or twice they let me play
A thousand kisses deep.

I loved you when you opened like a lily to the heat, you see, I'm just another snowman standing in the rain and sleet, who loved you with his frozen love, his second hand physique, with all he is, and all he was,
A thousand kisses deep.

But you dont need to hear me now, and every word I speak, it counts against me anyhow,
A thousand kisses deep.

"Generous Heart"

What if I can't prove the strength of your touch
My cries alone are not good enough
When I am with you, I don't feel much at all
You asked if you were working towards the fall

I have nothing to say about love anymore
Love is nothing, I am yours

You're in my body, in my house, I can
Drag you toward my generous heartland
But I'm spilling out around you, I need
Your help, I can't last, all in a frenzy

I have nothing to say about love anymore
Love is nothing, I am yours

I'm braced for kindness, slack insensitive
Woman, I'm being a little abrasive

Guess I don't need to run away with this love
I don't need to protect, I should be afraid of this love
I know it's my fault, I need to lie dead
To find a cascade toward something but red

I have nothing to say about love anymore
Love is nothing, I am yours
I have nothing to say about love anymore
Love is nothing, I am yours

"So Long"

I cannot hide my cards, dear
Can't even keep them close
I've seen how swiftly thoughts can
Collect into ghosts
When you should fear them most

I am not a coward
I am just afraid
Of how our new tomorrow
Will turn to yesterday

So long, so long
You know I understand
So long, so long
I'll see you when I can
When I can

You and I spoke last night
As I lay next to him
You told me if you fallowed
Every paper whim
You'd be wearing thin

I woke up with a longing
For just that mistake
Your ghost was calling
I was just beyond the break

So long, so long
You know I understand
So long, so long
I'll see you when I can
When I can

I'd like to tell you now dear
To pry open the door
I'd appeal to your body
To take me on the floor
To ask a ghost for more

The glorious will always
Be just around the bend
But I can't ask to borrow
What I can't bare to lend

So long, so long
You know I understand
So long, so long
I'll see you when I can
When I can

"By Myself"

I pulled you around the balcony
To break a hive you couldn't see
And buzzed for your big mouth to feed
On honey that ran out of me to choose you
And I'm playing with myself

I talked in rings to turn your spine
Losing memory of mine
But standing in a sturdy line
Doing all I can to confuse you
And I'm talking to myself

I prefer my dreams of you
To anything you'd ever do
So please don't play or talk or move
Before I have the chance to abuse you
And I'm dreaming of myself

I play Caliban in bed
Turn my mind out, bang my head
So I forget what you said
That I'll wind up dead before I bruise you
And I'm beating up myself
I'm beating up myself

Woe is me, I'm black and blue
At least I always tell the truth

"Animal Enough"

No one is animal enough to take up the space in my mind
That I don't wanna occupy
No one is animal enough to take up the space in my body
Traded lovin' for a hobby

And I hope you find something you like
And what lies behind your "Nevermind"
Hope you find some way to see
No one is animal enough for me

I've got too much to talk about
Without your hand over my mouth
A whimper leaves me like a shout
I've got too much to talk about after every single lie
I slip before your eagle eyes

And I hope you find something you like
And what lies behind your "Nevermind"
Hope you find some way to see
No one is animal enough for me

I've got options, I've got time but I am so impatiently
Giving them away for free
I've got options, I've got time but my muscle memory
Leads me walkin' down your street

And I hope you find something you like
And what lies behind your "Nevermind"
Hope you find some way to see
No one is animal enough
I hope you find something you like
And what lies behind your "Nevermind"
Hope you find some way to see
No one is animal enough for me

"Coverage"

Here is light in little rooms
Water colors, camera moves
Fooling you into the myth
Even my little laugh's a wish

Growing up a memory
Becoming who I used to be
Cover me, uncover you
Is that really what I'd do

If I were really here
Looking at you beamin'
If I were really alive, could I
Make it through every day dreamin'

I told you it's gums and teeth
There's nothing moving underneath
But there are shades you can't replace
With blush or blues or lights or grace

Here is where I put my trust
If you tell a lie enough
You can't pick it from the truth
It's been of tremendous use

If I were really here
Looking at you beamin'
If I were really alive, could I
Make it through every day dreamin'
Dreamin'

Growing up a memory
Becoming who I used to be
Cover me, uncover you
Is that really what I'd do

If I were really here
Looking at you beamin'
If I were really alive, could I
Make it through every day dreamin'
If I were really here
Looking at you beamin'
If I were really alive, could I
Make it through every day dreamin'

Dreamin'
Dreamin'

"Hold The Sun"

If I could, I would kiss you
The body doesn't lie
I'd hold you like soft water
Holds the sun against the sky
I know that she loves you
So I wouldn't dare to try
Hold you like soft water
Holds the sky

I'll turn in my lips
My heavy hands and say goodbye
'Cause I can't hear you moan
And I can't hear you sigh
I can't think about the singer
With her hand against your thigh
When all I want's to hold you
Like the sun holds the sky

I see the night has crept through your hair
To settle in your eyes
And I know until I break it
The tension will only rise
So here I will declare it
In a low but desperate cry
I wanna hold you like soft water
Holds the sky
I wanna hold you like soft water
Holds the sky

"River Like You"

I've loved a river like you before
I'm the one to blame
He washed away my cleverness
And hallowed out my name
I've loved a river like you before
The deep and thundering kind
He rushed into my belly and
Clouded over my eyes

If you wanted to be happy, which I somehow doubt
I could swallow your river if you opened your mouth

I've loved a river like you before
You can't scare me away
I've tamed the moss up on the rocks
And molded the red clay

If you wanted to be happy, which would be a surprise
I could swallow your sorrow if you opened your eyes

I've loved a river like you before
I'm a river too
So you can run into me
And I'll run into you

If you wanted to be happy, which I somehow doubt
I could swallow your river if you opened your mouth

I've loved a river like you before
If only I were wise
I never learned to turn and run
When I saw the water rise

"Bringing Me Down"

Feeling small, feeling ordinary
Not strong enough for all I carry
It's a light weight if you look around
So I must be weak if it's bringing me down

Feeling dumb or at least unlearned
Under a pile of books, I'm burdened
They're small ideas if you look around
So I must be weak if they're bringing me down

Feeling tired, so tired and lonely
Trying to believe kind words you told me
Guess I'm okay if you look around
So I must be weak if it's bringing me down

I have lied, I've lied and hidden
I've done things they deem forbidden
They're small crimes if you look around
So I must be weak if they're bringing me down

Mmm, bringing me down

Losing faith in the task at hand
Asking questions I don't understand
Nobody knows if you look around
So I must be weak if it's bringing me down

I wanna try to lift my spirits
Sing a song, if you wanna hear it
It's not much if you look around
But I must be weak if it's bringing me down

If it's bringing me down
If it's bringing me down
If it's bringing me down
If it's bringing me down

"Cricket"

There are places you can go when you're in the afterglow
And the lights hang above and below you
There are people you can find in that secret peace of mind
When you fear that no one knows you

The Earth's still spinnin', I promise nothing's wrong
You like it when we're dizzy, you can see what's really goin' on

There are cities you'll survive if you hang your head and hide
From the map that swears it'll guide you
You were feelin' really weak, had your harvest in your cheeks
On your knees for me to hide you

The Earth's still spinnin', I promise nothing's wrong
You like it when we're dizzy, you can see what's really goin' on

Really goin' on
Really goin' on

You were on the attack, but you had to take it back
'Cause you know there's nothing they owe you
The sun is risin' soon, but you're howlin' at the moon
'Cause you've heard it's got a lot to show you

The Earth's still spinnin', I promise nothing's wrong
You like it when we're dizzy, you can see what's really goin' on

Really goin' on
Really goin' on
On

There are prayers you can share
It's your fault, it's not fair
And in the end, no one can really make you
If you're bleedin' from a bite
Or basking, burning in the light
You see, really anything can break you

Well, the Earth's still spinnin', I promise nothing's wrong
You like it when we're dizzy, you can see what's really goin' on

Really goin' on
Really goin' on

One, two

"Menace"

Turn my gaze away
Relieve the impressions
That I've made
Like rain in my creeping hand
I want to behave
It's a small concession
All my regressions
I don't understand

But they're painful old news
And pale in comparison
To choosing you

Well, I don't wanna be a menace anymore
What could a menace be good for
So I will catch my wandering eye, watch the roses pass me by
And I'll try to make my menace into someone you'd adore

It's dangerous and short
Covertly calls for
An encore
The attention of strangers
As long as loving lasts
You don't want to
Here forever
Everybody loves a lover

Well, you really shouldn't ask
'Cause the answer's always, "Always"
'Til always is in the past

Well, I don't wanna be a menace anymore
What could a menace be good for
So I will catch my wandering eye and watch the roses pass me by
And I'll try to make my menace into someone you'd adore

Well, you really shouldn't ask
'Cause the answer's always, "Always"
'Til always is in the past

Well, I don't wanna be a menace anymore
What could a menace be good for
So I will catch my wandering eye, watch the roses pass me by
No, I don't wanna be a menace anymore
What could a menace be good for
So I will catch my wandering eye, watch the roses pass me by
And I'll try to make my menace into someone you'd adore

"Goodbye Rocketship"

I do what you tell me like it's my idea
I came down to find you, pretend that you're here
And I never could replace you, it's too dark to try
But I look for our memories, and their clothing, and their eyes

You didn't know, you didn't know

You're there when I need you, we talk on the phone
I know that you've been trying to build us a home
Yet I scramble to find one with couches and boys
But all I hear's an echo, the sound of your voice

You didn't know, you didn't know

You may have more to teach me, but what haven't I heard
Listening is easy, but learning is earned
I forgive you, and I thank you, you know all the reasons why
I'm sorry and I love you, all we can do is try

You didn't know how to raise me
Any more than I knew how to grow up
Childhood is over, and it wasn't enough

But Nina's in the garden and Rascal's on the roof
The charges against you, I know I have no proof
So goodbye to the Chelsea, goodbye to the rocket ship
There's only room for you and me there
And there's so much more to fit

You didn't know, you didn't know
You didn't know, you didn't know
You didn't know, you didn't know

"Mirth"

Twistin' around on blue leather booth
My ears still popping from travel and use
I picked at my oatmeal and plumped up my lips
He gives his hand a suggestion, wish
It's not you, it's New York I miss

I've got a problem I think he could fix
He seems to undo all my usual tricks
But the marks on his belly, the lines I trace
Shadow softness and romantic grace
It's not you, it's New York I face

I dreamt of him on a JetBlue flight
Nursing me into a feverish night
Lay on my back, whisperin' his name
Letting him unravel a decade of blame
It's not you, it's New York I claim

Well, in a thunder breath, I coughed up my heart
My life in my hands, a good place to start
Little creature born of joy and mirth
Loving without the help of anything
Little creature born of joy and mirth
Loving without the help of anything
On earth
It's not you, it's New York that works

"Backup Plan"

Your pencils, your dress socks
Your charger, your bike lock
Anything that's not in your junk drawer

I wanna be anything you've lost that you might be lookin' for

Your dirtbag, your small cash
Your pocket change, your eyelash
The kitty lurking out behind your door

I wanna be anything you've lost that you might be lookin' for
I wanna be anything you've lost that you might be lookin' for

Light a fire, live without it
Have a dark thought and tell me all about it
Your backup plan, your best man
Your torrid affair, your long hair

Go away, don't get too far, it's not the first time
I've been kicked out of bed for a guitar

The dream you planted in your forest
Your winter coat in summer storage
Your favorite game, your secret shame, your eyesore

I wanna be anything you've lost that you might be lookin' for
I wanna be anything you've lost that you might be lookin' for

"Bloomed Into Blue"

As a babbling baby
They blessed her a bastard birth
So, out they let her, quick as a blur
Through the backdoor, her bawling mother
Bled onto the bed boards
Bewinged, she flew
With valor and glow
Drinkin' up clouds
Bird-callin' to crows
Mid-air, she grew up
And out and sideways
She sang and she swooped
She peddled her play

She bloomed into blue
She bloomed into blue, into blue

Blokes were watching from below
Brows breaking
"Be still," she begged
As the blokes were shaking
Fed up, she descended
Frolicked in town
Her wings folded in
As her toes touched down
The blokes bid for her party
She sidestepped
She packed into blue
Blood on her biceps
They switched, mixed
Whispers of "weakling" and "witch"
She listened and let out
A sigh, a hiss

She bloomed into blue
She bloomed into blue, into blue

Boastfully looked at
Their blistering faces
She bowed low mocking
Their grisly graces
From the crowd, the blokes
Burst out simplistic
She can't be herself
She's gone ballistic
"Bend over, you bedraggled basket babe"
Nothing is sacred (Nothing is secret)
You're begging, unbrave
Please let me build something
Please let me be
I have beliefs in my brain
I'm a bottomless sea

She bloomed into blue
She bloomed into blue
She bloomed into blue
She bloomed into blue
She bloomed into blue
She bloomed into blue, into blue

(Break out of your beauty)
(By a standard, you weren't raised right)
She bloomed into blue, into blue
(She asked her biochemistry)
("Stop being you for a bit")
(Button up into blue, button up into blue)

"Hiatus"

I like your weird clothes, your needy demeanor
I like your days off and your key carabiner
I like your big head, your little taut body
I like your fine threads and your ridiculous hobbies

I know you bleed glitter and you have a heart of stone
All I really want's an actor of my own

Your affected walk, your witty conversation
Your free pillow talk, the way that you seek validation
Let's go on vacation, get soft and complacent
Take home a big puppy, get mean and impatient

I know you bleed glitter and you have a heart of stone
But all I really want's an actor of my own

I say, "I love Shepard," I wanna hear you say, "Me too"
I say, "I'm free tomorrow," I wanna hear "What should we do"
I want a gym routine, self-obsessed, hardly dressed teen dream
Who cares about sunscreen and loves to make me Wilhelm scream
'Cause it sounds like applause
Maybe he'll cheat on me, but I'll forgive him when he does

I know you bleed glitter and you have a heart of stone
But all I really want's an actor of my own

The Inn in Baton Rouge
She was a late-shift waitress
With a pour heavy, now you're home on hiatus
Does she hold a candle to me
I kissed my co-star in rehearsal anyway
(I'd like to hear that one)

"Sweet Tooth"

Told my mother that I love her
And that I'd lie to the accountant if she wants
I'll do whatever to protect her
I'll say anything just to make her stop

I saw a movie everybody hated
In an empty theatre in Duluth
Swear I really loved it
Love is such a better thing to do

I'm grateful for everything you put me through
It's the only reason I'm any good to talk to
When I'm sick or suffering, I'll still call you
About my big, sore sweet tooth

Search frantic for the moonlight
I bat I get cold beneath the stars
And instead, I found a soundbite
Of someone I love saying something mean and hard

Forgot I have a piece of plastic
In the place where my molar used to be
Sucking on a summer cherry
When you called, I bit hard into the seed

I'm grateful for everything you put me through
It's the only reason I'm any good to talk to
When I'm sick or suffering, I'll still call you
About my big, sore sweet tooth

So, my molar collapsed on me
Like a glacier melting in the heat
My mouth full up with lightning
I'm an outlet shock, a hole, a need
So, everybody loves you
And every little bit helps
I broke my bone, it was the worst she ever felt

I'm grateful for everything you put me through
It's the only reason I'm any good to talk to
When I'm sick or suffering, I'll still call you
About my big, sore sweet tooth

Big, sore sweet tooth
(Big, sore sweet tooth)
(Big, sore sweet tooth)
(Big, sore sweet tooth)
(Big, sore sweet tooth)
(Big, sore sweet tooth)
(Big, sore sweet tooth)
(Big, sore sweet tooth)
(Big, sore sweet tooth)
Da, da, da, da

"Crazy Kid"
(feat. Will Graefe)

I'm not a crazy kid, with you, I'm all grown up
Your phone is ringing and you don't pick up
You've been through the ringer and you've knocked yourself out
But your dust hasn't settled and you can't settle down
I'm grazing the clouds with my fingertips
Talkin' too loud, I'm havin' fun with it
And I'm thinkin' 'bout your innocence

I wanna be as tall as you can be
You've been breakin' your back bendin' down for me
It's cool in the shade of your shadow divine
Now the sun's on my face and it's burning my eyes
And I'm runnin' in place, now I'm fallin' behind
It's cool in the shade of your shadow divine

I never told you one true thing
I let you believe I'd been alone all spring
But our voices quivered and we took a deep breath
Like we got somethin' heavy off of our chest
I wanted everything mine to be yours too
Including the pain of losing you
I see you when I see your blue

Wanna be as tall as you can be
You've been breakin' your back bendin' down for me
It's cool in the shade of your shadow divine
Now the sun's on my face and it's burning my eyes
And I'm runnin' in place, now I'm fallin' behind
It's cool in the shade of your shadow divine
It's cool in the shade of your shadow divine

Cool in the shade, cool in the shade
Cool in the shade
Cool in the shade
I glow in the dark
You can take me apart, me apart
I glow in the dark
You can take me apart, me apart
I glow in the dark (If you asked me to, I come crawling back)
You can take me apart, me apart
I glow in the dark (If you asked me to, I come crawling back)
You can take me apart, me apart (Cool in the shade, cool in the shade)
I glow in the dark (If you asked me to, I come crawling back)
You can take me apart, me apart (Cool in the shade, cool in the shade)
If you asked me to then I'd come crawling right back for you
I glow in the dark
I'd come crawling right back for you

"Luna Moth"

I put my foot down on a luna moth
In the bathroom at your party
You screamed into my terrycloth
I said that I was sorry
You found me with a door locked
I only went upstairs to cry
I came over here to be alone
Not to kill your things that fly

I don't need anyone to hurt me
I can do that myself
I don't see why you would want me
If I could, I would be anybody else

Put a needle through a luna moth (Through a luna moth)
The one I crushed and let you down
I left it on your doorstep
But I didn't stick around (But I didn't stick around)
To watch you smile at an ugly thing
To try to ease my guilt
Watch you looking at a broken wing
Like it could be rebuilt

I don't need anyone to hurt me
I can do that myself
I don't see why you would want me
If I could, I would be anybody else
If I could, I would be anybody else

"South Elroy"

I've been under since the end of summer
When you flutter by, took all the color out of my eyes
Used up all my vibrance on South Elroy drive
When we fought and we fucked and we fought
I always took your side
Now I'm waitin' out this fever
I dream you're sliding quarters into the parkin' meter
A little more time in your beat-up black Mercedes
Parked in my burning mind
Call me crazy, crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy

Please don't forgive me
It'd be a pity after all of that
Watch me come crawlin' back
If you asked me to
I'd come crawlin' right back to you
If you asked me to
I'd come crawlin' back to you
Crawlin' back to you

I focus on the trouble each nightful
You swallowed bubbles made me beg for a biteful
Gave me your hand and moved it inside me
Smirk, what a jerk, good and plenty
I know you lied about your tattoo
Her name, your spine under my every touch
I know you lied about your plugs and glue
Funny, I really wouldn't have minded that much

Please don't forgive me
It'd be a pity after all of that
Watch me come crawlin' back
If you asked me to
I'd come crawlin' right back to you
If you asked me to
I'd come crawlin' back to you
If you asked me to (If you asked me to)
I'd come crawlin' right back to you (Crawlin' back to you)
If you asked me to
Then I'd come crawlin' right back to you
And now I'm callin' out to you

Oh my God, I gotta slow down now
(Oh my God, I gotta slow down now)
Oh my God, I gotta slow down somehow
(Oh my God, I gotta slow down somehow)
Oh my God, I gotta slow down now
(Oh my God, I gotta slow down now)
Oh my God, I gotta slow down somehow
(Oh my God, I gotta slow down somehow)
Down somehow, down somehow

"Thrse"

(Gotta, gotta slow down)

I go see Thrse dreamin'
She's stretchin' out her sore shoulder
Leanin' back, eyes closed, reachin' up
She's wishin' she was older
Dreamin' of an Appaloosa
Saddled up, ridin' out of town
Dreamin' of a Shelby cobra
Diggin' her tires in the ground

Bleeding, bringing in a new year's mess
Unaware of the stain on her dress

It's tactless, it's a test
It's just Thrse, it's just Thrse

White kitten in the corner
Obscene, it really says it all
Milk matches her underwear
And get her down, take her off the wall
She dreams of Marlon in Austin
Their bodies tangled in a net
She thinks of him every so often
When she feels like a space cadet

She empathizes with your feelings
She's more interested in ceilings

It's tactless, it's a test
It's just Thrse, it's just Thrse
It's tactless, it's a test
It's just Thrse, it's just Thrse

She reminds me of memories
Sleeping off the growing pains
We were sea anemones
Spelling out each other's names
Whispering inside our red house
While the adults were a-sleeping
I guess Thrse was just for me
A quiet I keep on keeping

Thrse does not belong to you
The horses, cars, and cowboys do

It's tactless, it's a test
It's just Thrse, it's just Thrse
It's tactless, it's a test
It's just Thrse, it's just Thrse
It's tactless, it's a test
It's just Thrse
It's tactless, it's a test
It's just Thrse

"Sticky Little Words"

Writing's too slow
Talking's too fast
Lately real low
Lies at last
Oh dear, my dear
Get in all your licks
I'll string my words
Something will stick

Sticky little words
They heal and they hurt
They never really work
They feed the birds
That's it, I guess
They might make you laugh
They might make you mad
But they won't bring you back
They won't bring you back

Oh dear, my dear
There's so much to say
If you plug your lil' ears
I'll fade away
Sorry's too slow
To stop this crash
And leave me alone
Was just too fast

Sticky little words
They heal and they hurt
They never really work
They feed the birds
That's it, that's that
They might make you laugh
They might make you mad
But they won't bring you back
They won't bring you back

"Over"

Over, over, I come over, it's October
I explain that I'm a rover
Told ya, told ya
Angry, angry, now I see you're angry at me
I never said you could teach me
Leave me, leave me
I'm bound, I'm bound, you stole my ribbon
And you wound three times my worn-out throat around
No sound, no sound

I'm gonna have to be stronger than I wanted to be
I'm gonna have to be stronger than I wanted to be

No pain, no pain, I know you think I felt no pain
So tranquil now
I look so tame, no blame, no blame
A tail of woe, preordained, grim from the get-go
Time to loosen your grip, let go
I know, I know
I fear, I fear, I fear I'm gonna die right here
You would be wise now to steer clear
My dear, my dear

I'm gonna have to be stronger than I wanted to be
I'm gonna have to be stronger than I wanted to be
I'm gonna have to be stronger than I wanted to be

Empty, empty, I'm not empty, this bud keeps a bee
Like what you see, but it won't be pretty, pretty
I want my smile weak and wrong
My arms and legs real strong
I want my skin to fall, stretch long
I want my mind fresh, even when my body's rotten
I want to know more than you have forgotten
I'm not your flower, I'm the pollen

I'm gonna have to be stronger than I wanted to be
I'm gonna have to be stronger than I wanted to be
I'm gonna have to be stronger than I wanted to be

Callin', callin' out to my inner appalin' monster
She is bravin', bravin'
Savin' me from you

"Restless Moon"

I combine the weight of breathing with your active morning birds
A weakness is believing in my imagination of yours
I see it, though, I do, in the turning of your mind
I see the things you think, your electric body beside

Your body beside
The tide is in, it will go out
I remember when you said that
I know you meant it now
I know you meant it now

Took interest in the roses on your button-down
I was fascinated by the colors on that cow
We did a lot of talking, unnaturally awake
You said it makes you feel sad to watch me make mistakes

My body beside
The tide is in, it will go out
I remember when you said that
I know you meant it now
The tide is in, it will go out
I remember when you said that
I know you meant it now
I know you meant it now

Drink up all the darkness
Choke on the moon in your mouth
Drink up all the darkness
Choke on the moon in your mouth
Drink up all the darkness
Choke on the moon in your mouth

Drink up all the darkness
I know you did it for show
I watched you swallow the moon
And now your belly glows
The reflection of the sunlight
On your regular stone

You're full of holes, I know
You're full of holes, I know

"Driver"

One, two, three, one

I cook and I clean now
I do different things than I used to do
Feel I'm always rinsin' dishes
I load them and I think about you
I imagine my mom and dad
Loosely neckin' in the back of a taxi cab
I'd give everything I'll ever have to see them happy
Kissin' just like that

And oh, I can watch it in the movies
I don't wanna see it that crafted and clear
Wanna be the pervert driver
Gazin' at them through a tilted mirror

I stay up, I play Backgammon now
Not to dirty a glass, I drink straight from the spout
I sleep through the night now
On the medication you left at my house
I miss you like the soft spot at the top of my baby skull's rose
I miss you like my fontanels
I miss you like my openness that closed

Now I'll tell you a secret
A secret that everyone already knows
You remind me of my father
Your attitude, your disheveled clothes

Thinkin' of you makes me happy
Happy that my father, he got free
That even though it hurt me
He can be whoever the hell he wants to be

You see, a free man can be a relied on
Trusted not to let go of the bike
Nothin' stickin' his feet to the ground
No one's holdin' a string to his kite

"Mermaid Bar"

There was no moon black sky on the night
I jumped from the bridge toward the river
I swear, I saw silver star light
On the water's surface, a shimmer
Pounded the pulse, I couldn't finish
Didn't hear a splash or feel the cold
Was full of bubbles for a minute

Turned to ice, then cycloid scales of gold
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, no
Turned to ice, then cycloid scales of gold
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, no

My lungs deflated, my fingers weaved
Rips separated for gills to breathe
Ran my tongue over my sharp new teeth
Panicked, swimming, collapsed in the reeds
Taken with the current to the sea
Tide disrupting desperate dreams
My belly empty, body weak

I had no sound, no way to speak
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, no
I had no sound, no way to speak
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, no

I was close to quiet death again
When new instincts woke me from the spell
I killed a Diamondback terrapin
Was most scared of my awful self
I woke up on cold stones, broken glass
Winter beach at Long Island's end
I found that I could still maneuver

Slip slide on the sand and the cement
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, no
Slip slide on the sand and the cement
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, no

I opened sardine dream mermaid bar
We serve most oysters and caviar
Leave your seashells in our tall tip jar
There are more like me, I swear, there are
Come for scallops, come to hear our song
Come if you're in awful, bad trouble
Come if you're certain you don't belong

Some that fall, don't land in bubbles
'Cause some that fall, don't land in bubbles (In bubbles, bubbles)
Some that fall, don't land in bubbles
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, no
Some that fall, don't land in bubbles (Bubbles, bubbles)
Some that fall, don't land in bubbles

"Blue Hippo"

She sat on the cliff of the bed
Tackled me with a plastic comb
Pressed her fingers into my head
Start at the blonde, search for the bone
She tries to tame me, her nails and my knots
Bathe with the sandman, dress up for what's not

Let me tangle, let me dry
Want it wicked, let me ride

Come into my cave
Blue hippo into the black
I'm your problem child
Your matter of fact

I slyly side-step, sorry
Drag my heels across the street
She tells me I'm unlettered while
I read the backs of her knees
Catch me in habits, one tight skyward eye
Pull hats out of rabbits and salt out of the sky

Let me tangle, let me try
Want it wicked, let me rile

Come into my cave
Blue hippo into the black
I'm your problem child (Problem)
Your matter of fact

What I thought was in whale water
Was really runnin' through the pipes
To show off her flexibility
She made a fool of my fight
I bit her belly, she bellowed like a swan
Cured me like a petal pressed in her open palm

Let me tangle, let me dry
Want it wicked, let me rile

Come into my cave
Blue hippo into the black
I'm your problem child (Problem)
Your matter of fact
Come into my cave
Blue hippo into the black
I'm your problem child (Problem)
Your matter of fact

"Coming Around Again"

A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart

I know nothing stays the same
If you're willing to play the game
You will be coming around again

Don't mind if I fall apart
There's more room in a broken heart

A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart

I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
You will be coming around again

I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
You will be coming around again

Don't mind if I fall apart
There's more room in a broken heart

I believe in love
So what else can I do
I'm so in love with you

I believe in you
I believe in love
I believe in love
I believe in love

I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
You will be coming around again

I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
You will be coming around again

Don't mind if I fall apart
There's more room in a broken heart

"Rose And Thorn"

I was talking to myself
You leaned in to hear
I caught your silky laugh
Like a ribbon in my ear
You lay distracted
Like Truman on the ropes
I stood sunburnt and naked
So heavy with hope

And I'm not sure
If I was promised or warned
When you said you'd be my rose and thorn

If you'd like to bloom
I will make it rain
With the pigs that made it to the moon
And a dog who learned her name
I want you to understand
But you just can't win
I write our names upon the sand
And you watch the tide come in

And I've been waiting for you, baby
Since the day I was born
You'll always be my rose and thorn

No one else will ever hurt me
No one else will get to try
No one else has petals
That fall up towards the sky

I know I'm too preoccupied
With what lays ahead
But I can't seem to settle on
What to think about instead
I should live in the moment
But I'd never make it home
I'd lay here with my hands on you
Till I was only breath and bone

And I'm not sure
If I was promised or warned
When you said you'd be my rose and thorn
And I've been waiting for you, baby
Since the day I was born
You'll always be my rose and thorn

"Stay Open"

Close the door behind me
Lock up when I leave
Nurse my pride, throw in a please
But I'll do anything you ask

Things will change, they always do
But my heart will stay open
For you

Sorry that I lost your key
I'm not accustomed to security
There's nothing you could promise me
That would let me catch my breath

Things will change, they always do
But my heart will stay open
For you

This cold wind comes quickly
Through an open door
And every blow lands heavy
When you want more
But, baby, I am ready
Whatever's in store

Stumble over your fine line
Falling further every time
Speak the words, it's in your eyes
That I don't wanna guess

Things will change, they always do
But my heart will stay open
For you

I'm not sure we get to choose
Love can make a child of you
But when I try and tell the truth
Out comes your little name

Things will change, they always do
But my heart will stay open
For you

My heart will stay open for you
My heart will stay open for you

"To Love A Boy"

I want to love a boy
The way I love the ocean
Wish I was not afraid
Of all I have that's broken
I know I must behave
To contain all my emotion

But I want to love a boy
The way I love the ocean

Like a hidden cave
I am always open
I hold the space you made
I'm empty but still hoping
I have a feeling
A terrible fear encroaching

That I'll never love a boy
The way I Iove the ocean

I ask why
It's better to speak than it is to die
One more try
It's better to laugh than it is to lie

I thought I had a man
Someone who could hold me
But nobody can
I wish someone had told me
I was born yesterday
And I'm still wet, still soaking

And I want to love a boy
The way I love the ocean
The way I love the ocean
The way I love the ocean

"We Don't Run"

We don't run, we don't compromise
We don't quit, we never do
We look for love, we find it in the eyes
The eyes of me and the eyes of you

You are the road, you are the only way
I'll follow you forever more
We'll look for love, we'll find it in the eyes
The eyes that see through all the doors

There is a train that races through the night
On rails of steel that reach the soul
Fueled by fire as soft as candle light
But it warms the heart of a love grown cold

We don't run, we don't compromise
We don't quit, we never do
We look for love, we find it in the eyes
The eyes of me and the eyes of you

Words that feel, words that sympathize
Words that heal and understand
Say them now, let them materialize
Say the words throughout the land

We don't run, we don't compromise
We don't quit, we sometimes do
We look for love, we find it in the eyes
The eyes of me and the eyes of you

We don't run, we don't compromise
We don't quit, we never do
We look for love, we find it in the eyes
The eyes of me and the eyes of you

"Hello"
(feat. Rejjie Snow)

Hello

Are you into me, like I'm into you
Do you wanna do the things I wanna do with you
You're so close, and yet so far
I wonder how you look when you're in the dark

You're just one click away, click away, click away
From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake
You're just one click away, click away, click away
From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake

Played you Doom, man, you play Drake
You left crumbs all on my face
Taste like Riri, taste like Bey
Bought you Fenty, took his place
Rolled your weed and kissed your face
Man, wanna smoke you out like all day
Man, wanna do a quickie in the hallway, can
You be all down for the boy, no mass
Hot jump, skip rope, twenty-three years old
Made a hundred grand and went broke, I'm an asshole
Clairo, will you be my real and my fake though
Pesos, cashing out checks when I say so
Frame my life and take my soul
Make me crazy, make me old
Send me roses, text my phone
Fake like rappers, fake like jokes
I know

You're just one click away, click away, click away
From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake
You're just one click away, click away, click away
From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake

"Flaming Hot Cheetos"

Sometimes I feel like I just wanna go back to my old ways
You're telling me I'm silly
"It's no fun in the old days"
I'm such a romantic
I never remember how things really happened
I guess you're attractive
Or something

"Live in the moment"
That's what they tell me
But what ever happened
To when you would hold me
And hold me
And hold me

"Girlfriend" or "girl, that's a friend"
It's easy just to pretend
That we don't have something real

It's just how we feel
We feel
Oh, it's just how we feel
How we feel

I'm feeling something, right
I'm feeling something, right
I'm feeling something, right
I'm feeling something, right
I'm feeling something, right
I'm feeling something, right

I want to be the one you think about at night
And I want to be the one that you would put up a fight for
You know that I adore
That even when you're bored
I'd buy you anything and everything I can't afford

"B.O.M.D."
(feat. Danny L Harle)

Stop, wait a minute
Tell me what you're thinking
Baby, I know you so well
I'll put my heart in it (in it)
Hold me for a minute (minute)
Baby, I would never lie to you (lie to you)

Pull me close, tell me why
Put me in your bed at night
I wanna stay here forever
Pull me close, but don't you lie
Put me in your dreams at night
I shouldn't tell you this

You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
Of my dreams

Somedays I try to call
You never seem to fall for me at all
Baby, why you so cold
I'm standing at your door
Don't understand why you ignore my love
It is so warm for you

And you're the boy of my dreams
It's not so hard to see why you're the one for me
I love you so dearly
You're the boy of my dreams
It's not so hard to see why you're the one for me
I love you so dearly

You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy, you're the boy
You're the boy of my dreams
Of my dreams

"4EVER"

Some things just aren't that simple
You called me wondering why I changed or why I don't look the same
Why I think so differently now

Is it ever gonna change
Am I gonna feel this way forever
Are you gonna be around for me to count on
Is it ever gonna change
Am I gonna feel this way forever
Are you gonna be around for me to count on, count on
On-on-on, on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on

Some things just never seem to fade
I'm thinking about how we were on our first date
You understood the words I was saying
I knew I'd never let you get away
Hold you tight, squeeze you right
Tell you what I want
Put me in your bedroom and I'll sing a little song
Hold you tight, squeeze you right
Give you all I've got
See you in the morning
Over coffee, we'll talk

Is it ever gonna change
Am I gonna feel this way forever
Are you gonna be around for me to count on
Is it ever gonna change
Am I gonna feel this way forever
Are you gonna be around for me to count on, count on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on

"Pretty Girl"

Polaroid of you dancing in my room
I want to remember
I think it was about noon
It's getting harder to understand, to understand
How you felt in my hands (in my hands)

I could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
And I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you want me to
I could be a pretty girl
Won't ever make you blue
I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in you

I was so blinded by you, now I cry
Just thinking bout the fool that I was
I was such a fool
I'm alone now but its better for me
I don't need all your negativity

I could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
And I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you want me to
I could be a pretty girl
I'll never make you blue
I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in you

"How (Demo)"

How did I try to get you off my mind
How did I try to get you off my mind
Could this be the end
Of you and I for now
Hope that I see you soon
Don't know what I would do

My heart is under the weather
I know that I'm the only one who can heal it
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I try to beat the struggle for you
That's just too hard for anyone to do

"Alewife"

In Massachusetts, only 30 minutes from Alewife
I lay in my room
Wonderin' why I've got this life
I met you by surprise
You were hangin' out all the time
But you know you saved me from doin'
Something to myself that night

You called me seven times
One, two, three, four, on the line
I didn't mean to scare you
Just had the thoughts in my mind
They showed up to my door
My parents didn't know what for
Swear I could've done it
If you weren't there when I hit the floor

It's been so long
And you've been my sister all along
But you know I'll be alright
Eighth grade was never that tight

"Impossible"

How are you feeling
How are you doing
I'm sorry, I just wanted to hear your voice, so clear
What are you thinking
Am I a nuisance
It's so strange to talk after all these years

What does it mean, and
It's so confusing
All my old feelings coming back to me
When was the last time
I saw your face
Know it like the back of my hand, I'd say
And you know I'm not dumb anymore
I picked up the books you threw to the floor
Put them back on the shelf
Don't you see how much I want your help

And I know we're not the same as we were
Used to be falling hard, but now it just hurts
Me so bad
And you know that I can't hold back
All of these worries that I've had
'Bout you

And I know
That it's time
To forget how I'm feeling, don't want to give in
But I know
Know that it's right
To listen to my breathing and start believing myself
And I know
That it's time
To forget how I'm feeling, don't want to give in
But I know
Know that it's right
To listen to my breathing and start believing myself

Woah, myself
Myself

And I know we're not the same as we were
Used to be falling hard, but now it just hurts
Me so bad
And you know that I can't hold back
All these worries that I've had
'Bout you

"Closer To You"

I feel it in my bones
Even when I'm alone
Momma said, "I told you so"
Going down a different road
You call me late at night
I pick up every time
Wish that I could rewind
Get some peace of mind

Shut up, don't wanna hear it now I'm fed up
Wish I could say it was enough
To make me walk away
And I'm messed up
'Cause every time I start to get up
And now my head feels fucked up
And I know it won't change

The things you do
Only make me want to get closer to you
And the things that you say
Only make me want to stay

Can't push me away
I'm not going, I'll wait
You know this street runs two ways

So, I need to hear your voice
Know I'm standing here by choice
And I can't hear the background noise, anyway

Shut up don't wanna hear it now I'm fed up
Wish I could say it was enough to make me walk away
And I'm messed up, 'cause every time I start to get up
And now my head feels fucked up
And I know it won't change

The things you do
Only make me want to get closer to you
And the things that you say
Only make me want to stay

"North"

I'm nervous, couldn't tell you why
Touching me, hands warm on my thighs
And I know I could turn a blind eye
Afraid of what I'm gonna find
Does it really have to be this way
Oh, when my body hasn't felt the same
Since you left my apartment
Think I'm used to how you ascend

I just want to let you know
I'm seeing sides that you don't show
And I know that we got some potential
'Cause that love you gave me was so gentle

Do you think that you could stay
I need more time, I need to get away from you
For my lover
Spinning all on the ground
Is it all I have What are you saying
Usually I'd be fine, but my head is spinning
I never let anybody in
Somehow you got under my skin

Never seen a face like yours
I got it together but my breath feels short
I don't wanna close the door
Maybe I should just go up north

All I'm tryna say
Is I miss you in every way
Fingertips on my back
Things I know that I can't have

Never seen a face like yours
I got it together but my breath feels short
I don't wanna close the door
Maybe I should just go up north

Maybe I should just go up north
Maybe I should just go up north

"Bags"

Every second counts
I don't want to talk to you anymore
All these little games
You can call me by the name I gave you
Yesterday

Every minute counts
I don't want to watch TV anymore
Can you figure me out
Just doin' this to waste more time on the couch

Can you see me I'm waiting for the right time
I can't read you but if you want, the pleasure's all mine
Can you see me using everything to hold back
I guess this could be worse
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags

Pour your glass of wine
Mitchell told me I should be just fine
Cases under the bed
Spill it open let it rush to my head

I don't want to be forward
I don't want to cut corners
Savor this with everything I have inside me
I'm not the type to run
I know that we're having fun
But what's the rush
Kissing and my cheeks are so flushed

Tell you how I felt
Sugar coated melting in your mouth
Pardon my emotions
I should probably keep it all to myself
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me

Can you see me I'm waiting for the right time
I can't read you but if you want, the pleasure's all mine
Can you see me using everything to hold back
I guess this could be worse
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags

"Softly"

Is it alright
To feel this way so early
But am I blind
All the sweet nothings
Falling in love over night

Didn't mean to get so close
And I know that I should probably go
But I got this feeling
Tell me girl I gotta know

Touch you softly I call you up late at night
Know that it isn't right
But you can be my one and only
You get me in the mood
Know what I'm trying to do
Do you think that we could move
Closer baby I want you

And all my life
Been wanting this forever
And in my mind
Think of ways to ask you
Why don't you come over sometime

Didn't mean to get so close
And I know that I should probably go
But I got this feeling
Tell me girl I got to know

Touch you softly I call you up late at night
Know that it isn't right
But you can be my one and only
You get me in the mood
Know what I'm trying to do
Do you think that we could move
Closer baby I want you, yeah

And I don't care what they say
And I don't care what they say
Care what they say to me
I'm doing it differently
Baby, I'm doing it differently

"Sofia"

I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say, you're mine
Sofia know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say, you're mine
Sofia know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

You know
I'll do anything you ask me to
But oh my god
I think I'm in love with you

Standing here alone now
Think that we can drive around
I just want to say
How I love you with your hair down
Baby you don't got to fight
I'll be here til the end of time
Wishing that you were mine
Pull you in, it's alright

I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say, you're mine
Sofia know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

Honey, I don't want it to fade
There's things that I know could get in the way
But, I don't want to say goodbye
And I think that we could do it if we tried

I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say, you're mine
Sofia know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

I think we could do it if we tried
I think we could do it if we tried

Sofia know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime
Sofia know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

"White Flag"

Piece it all
Back together again
Didn't get along
Been four years since
We had it all
And you were my friend
Those days got away
Hope you find solace in this

I was 15 when
I first felt loneliness
Cut my hair
Only listened to Elvis

Grown apart and we're so far gone
But waving the white flag
Sending my love back, move on

Laughing at me
You kick me when I'm down
Oh, how can you pretend
You didn't say that now
Wish you the best
I know that you're stressed out
But you know in small towns
What goes around comes back around

"Feel Something"

Travelled so far on my own
I don't know where I've gone
And I don't wanna be alone
When I am so far from my home

You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to
Get over you

Wanna go back to the place where we started
At the party, I see you, but you keep your guard up
We could be something special if you wanted
I'm afraid that if we tried to
You would just give up (You would just give up)

You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to get over you
You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to get over you

Do you wanna go away with me
Do you wanna go away with me
Do you wanna go away with me
Do you wanna go away with me

You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to get over you
You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to get over you

"Sinking"

Every night
Think of things I can't do or haven't done
It doesn't make me weak, sometimes I feel like I can't breathe
Is that all you see in me

Don't you wait for something or
Else you'll be sinking to the floor
No, you can't help no more
Is it my doing Is it my doing (Mm)

It starts getting colder
Why doe sit feel like I'm older than I ask to be
But when you say my name
It all falls away to tenderly

Don't you wait for something or
Else you'll be sinking to the floor
Oh, you tried to help me
Why do I feel so cold
Is it my doing Is it my doing

(Ooh)
Is it my doing Is it my doing
(Ooh)
Is it my doing
(Ooh)
Mm-mm
Is it my doing
(Ooh)
Mm-mm

"I Wouldn't Ask You"

I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me (I think I'm losing you)

Sores appear 'round my neck, don't get close to me
Ask about your life, still in the nose-bleeds
Laying in your bed, call it intimacy
Wish I could get past the security
Wonder why I wake up living in a made-up
Dream of you and I, together there
Baby, wake the fuck up
Time for you to grow up
Don't you know that life is rarely ever fair

I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me

Tell you how I feel, I keep it real clean
Lock hanging 'round my neck, you don't get a key
Come a little closer, I'll show you what I mean
Oh, boy, no, it's all for me
Ice cold, baby, I'm ice cold
You're the only one who could make me thaw
Ice cold, baby, I'm ice cold
You're the only one who could make me thaw

I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, I wouldn't ask you to take care of me

I wouldn't ask you, baby
I wouldn't ask you, baby
To be the one I love
To be the one I love, I love
We could be
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
Caught me by surprise
Everything I need in my life
I wanna call you mine
I wanna be intertwined
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
Feels like I've known you for so long
Without you, I don't feel strong
Feels like I've known you for so long
Without you, I don't feel so strong
So strong
We could be so strong

"Bambi"

I'm stepping inside a universe
Designed against my own beliefs
They're toying with me and tapping their feet
The work's laid out, cut out to the seams

It's not that I crave
Any more company
I'd like to say, say a few things
Clearing your throat while I count to three
Keep hold of my hand
We both know I can leave

I don't like to cry, before I know why
But honestly, I might
You pick a new fight, wiping tears from the night
Blue ribbon ties while emotions are high

I told all my friends
They were glad to see
Sat in a circle, in front of my Claud's tapestry
In a dorm less than three
Minutes to drive
We both can always

Take it or leave it
The moments here
And you should believe it
Know that you should

I pull until I'm left with the burns
Blisters and the dirt left in-between my fingers
Rushing so I can beat the line
But what if all I want is conversation and time
I move so I don't have to think twice
I drift and float through counties with my one sided climb

Once, I oughta make a choice to move forward
I'll take, I'll take a picture for your locker

"Amoeba"

Between the gaps I was swimming laps
Got close to some epiphany
I'll convince a friend to join deep ends
Have your toes touch the lack of cement

Gather to one corner of the woods
Echo chambers inside a neighborhood
And centerfold, humility shown
You're not as good as what your mama's sewn

Aren't you glad that you reside
In a hell and in disguise
Nobody yet everything
A pool to shed your memory

Could you say you even tried
You haven't called your family twice
I can hope tonight goes differently
But I show up to the party just to leave

Between the gaps, keep it under wraps
How I got to some epiphany
I'll convince myself when it turns to twelve
The photos keep the sentiment

Gather to one corner of the woods
Echo chambers inside a neighborhood
And centerfold, humility shown
You're not as good as what your mama's sewn

Aren't you glad that you reside
In a hell and in disguise
Nobody yet everything
A pool to shed your memory

Could you say you even tried
You haven't called your family twice
I can hope tonight goes differently
But I show up to the party just to leave

Pulling back I tried to find
The point of wasting precious time
I sip and toast to normalcy
A fool's way into jealousy

I mock and imitate goodbyes
When I know that I can't deny
That I'll be here forever while
I show up to the party just to leave

"Partridge"

You move in your ways without a law
And I'll force you to feel the weight I'm standing on
But the perfect harmony is lost
As I watch you fall awake and ask, "What's wrong
Did I really miss all the work you've done"
(All the work I've done)

Calling someone else is only harder
I'll explain myself again
Take the chance on someone's daughter
She makes me feel like I'm the best

The only time I see you smile
Is after hours or the finish line
But bring yourself to the edge
Of the cliff
And look upon
The animals who wake before us at dawn
(All the work they've done)

Comfortable, unmotivated always
Seeking other stories other memories
I'm sorry I have to hold you longer than you expected
It's only temporary

I'll let you walk and make your own discovery
That one of these days, I know that you might come back to me

"innias"

See me standing on the corner of Comstock
And Waverly in a daze
Where I saw my brother speak for the first time since he graduated in the Spring
Got a cold piece of information to bring to you
Said, "Sorry but I can't stay here while we wait for June"
I miss the southern Cosmos and the innias
Oh, the innias
It comes to me in a dream, in the dead heat and the suffocating
Wet grip that's got a hold on my mama
It's Marietta's kiss

Quietly, I'm tempted
Sure sounds nice to settle down for a while
Let the real estate show itself to me
I could wake up with a baby in a sling
Just a couple doors down from Abigail
My sister, man, and her ring

Quietly, I'm tempted
Sure sounds nice to settle down for a while
Let the real estate show itself to me
I could wake up with a baby in a sling
Just a couple doors down from Abigail
My sister, man, and her ring

"Blouse"

Here we are
Quiet at your kitchen table
With courtesy to little pet peeves
Napkins on laps strands pulled back
I hang the scarf and my mom's anorak

Why do I tell you how I feel
When you're just looking down the blouse
It's something I wouldn't say out loud
If touch could make them hear
Then touch me now
If touch could make them hear
Then touch me now

Talking to
Some who laugh and others scorned
I guess humour could help me after all
It's funny now I'm just useless and a whore
But I get a co-sign from your favourite one-man show

Why do I tell you how I feel
When you're too busy looking down my blouse
It's something I wouldn't say out loud
If touch could make them hear
Then touch me now
If touch could make them hear
Then touch me now
If touch could make them hear
Then touch me now

"Wade"

Holding out all my fears and faults
Those that conquer me
Started the second pack
Before the first ones finishing

I like to bridge the gap between
A break and long lost lovers
Only to get me by until I decide
I've had enough

Most of the time
I can feel them on me
The eyes from the stranger's window
It's dark and It's lonely
But it's nothing to me
At least somebody's home

Decades are wasting
On your name
You'll grasp the concept of life
When you give up the point of trying
If you don't do the things you do
They'll just happen to you

Pulling out all my weight
And do my part and you'll say
"Oh I'm so glad you're here with us today
You probably thought you would be gone"
And until there's another way
I just have to face
That there's no real place
To go where I really could be alone

I'd promise you now, that if I had known
I wouldn't be standing here
There's memories to be made
And water that's to wade
I used it all up drying tears

Of course I don't regret
The moments where I wept
And yearned for what I've got now
It's only time
It won't age like wine
But It's mine, and I'll take the blow

"Harbor"

Okay, I'm finished now
And I kept my faith for long enough
And I hope I'm old and fairly sober
If I'm let down

Maybe you keep me around
For the constant affirmations
While I scrounge for understanding
And fall out

I'll let you win and I'll let you tie
The ribbon to my hair
Just so that we could come back to this if we really cared
The morning gates stay open
If you had a thought that I'd be there
(Oh, I'd be there)

Know we could use a break
Because I can't feel my feet
I carried you all the way upstairs
So you can sleep and I can think

Stand guard
When I am near
Clinging on to everything you fear
Keeping me close
While you hold me out and say
I don't love you that way

Harbor myself away from everyone else
I'm half awake and intimate
Eyes closed and I'll commit
What I wish I had with you
I'll pretend until it's true
I don't love you that way

Swallow the pill, it's only fair that I hear
Know myself better than I have in years
I don't know why I have to defend what I feel
I try

Stand your guard
When I am near
Loathe me until
You're reminded of the deal
One of us knows
When you hold me out and say
You don't love me that way

"Just For Today"

Honestly, I didn't think I'd end up here this time
Or anywhere at all, I'm distant just enough to never fall behind
Picturing the saddest scene of wearing bedsheets
And two pats on the back, "It just takes time"
It's getting late, since when did taking time take all my life

Mommy
I'm afraid I've been talking to the hotline again
It's stirring
But the ripples always seek out the ones who carry me

I blocked out the month of February for support
At least I have this year, I won't be worrying anyone on tour
As we speak, I'm here to meet devils for tea
Peering 'round the corner of my life
I throw my drink into the faces of my demise

At thirty
Your honey's gonna ask you, "What the hell is wrong with me"
And finally
An answer from your throat comes crawling and you can proceed

"Reaper"

It's nice to hear your voice again
I pushed you so far down and I let you sink through the drain
There's a claw on my shoulder
And she's saying the obvious
"You know eventually you're gonna have to be a provider, too"

She's coming closer, I can feel her breathe
I keep forgetting that I'll have a family
If I listen in, with my hands cupped and on my knees
I can hear the single obnoxious sigh of relief

I'm born to be somebody then somebody comes from me
I'll tell you about the Rabbit Moon and when to keep walking
I'll spare you pain, I can feel my shame come through that door
I can't fuck it up if it's not there at all

I'm born to be somebody then somebody comes from me
I'll show you where I did swim team and drive to Dunwoody
I'll spare you pain, I can feel my shame creep through that floor
I can't fuck it up if it's not there at all
I can't fuck it up if it's not there at all

"Little Changes"

I see the fog as a clean slate
There's room for us
There's room for anything

The usual urge I'd see clear
A flower for you and the dogs are near

But white light comes from nothing at all
For the first time it feels
Good
Good to fall between
The ones I love and the ones that faded
He loved me good enough to calm me down
But tried to trick me into little changes

I see the end before it begins
No use to work, no use in anything
A crack in the sky
The heaven's hand
A cloud just for you and a place to land

But white noise comes from nothing at all
And finally I feel
Good
Good to fall between
The ones I love and the ones that faded
He loved me good enough to calm me down
But tried to trick me into little changes

"Management"

Mom, would you give me a ring
One for the ride and one for the magazines
She's only twenty-two

A flash to the upbringing
Of the child, the canine
What will become mine
Once I decide to leave

Seek to take and give it all away
Once you know it's only a maze
There could be more days like today

Complain to the management
About my lack of self respect
Fast forward to when I have friends
And men who don't interject
Harping over old regrets
Hating how I let it get
To me

Only for a short while
I'm bound to lose my head
And just when I start to think it's ended
Another demand commences
I'm doing it for my future self
The one who needs more attention
I'll forget to forgive and hold it all in
I'm old with some resentment

"2 Hold U"

Is it a crime that I'm just trying to hold you
To hold you
Interlocking fingers and I'm ready, I told you
I told you
If I'm in love then why is my heart hurting
Hurting

Everywhere that I go
I just see you (I see you)
I wrote it down
I told my mom
My friends all know
We get along
I want you
To want me too

I want to kiss you
I want to love you
I want to touch you
I think too much

You

"Bubble Gum"

Sorry I didn't kiss you
But it's obvious I wanted to
Bubble gum down my throat and it's a curse
But my luck couldn't get any worse

'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grin

You look so nice in your shirt
It's sad because it just hurts
I'd do anything for you
But would you do that for me, too

'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these 7 years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grin

"Duet"

You've got nice eyes
They're very blue
That is why I look at you
I look at you
I look at you
I look at you
I look at you
I look at you

Making a list
Of people to kiss
The list is a million you's long
Just you's all the way down

Olive oil soft
And laundry warm
I know I like you
I just don't know what for

With my boy Ronnie
Listening to Connie
I couldn't stop if I tried
I will love you til I die

Oh

"Favoritism"

I was in love for the second time
She told me not to lie
You said, honey, I can sense that you're
Struggling to find out what happened to you
On tour and alone with nothing to lose
Cried myself to sleep that night
I haven't wrapped my head around it
Maybe I should think about
Your hands on my sides, my shirt lost to wine

When I turned around and said
"I can't believe you like me"
When I turned around and said
"I can't believe you like me better than the rest"
When I turned around and said
"I can't believe you like me better than the rest"

Turns out kissing someone older
Doesn't mean there's gonna be a lesson attached
Say, I'm mature for my age
But there's a bed to be made, why don't you lie in it
Swear I'll take this one to my grave
And nothing's gonna change
Oh man, it is the same
There's a child writing stories of when they become king
And learn to take everything

When I turned around and said
"I can't believe you like me better than the rest"
When I turned around and said
"I can't believe you like me better than the rest"
Oh, better than the rest

"For Now"

Pull the rug from underneath me now
Caught up in the landslide
Blindside on the ground
Would it make a difference if I'd looked at all
Loving you is simple, sweet
And I'm bound to fall

'Cause I'm loving you for now
Loving you for now
I'm loving you for now
Until it all breaks down

Pull the cloth from over my eyes tonight
Let me see what I fear
What's it symbolize
Would it make a difference if I learned at all
Loving you is freeing me
Oil in your palm

'Cause I'm loving you for now
I'm loving you for now
'Cause I'm loving you for now
Until it all breaks down

"Get With U"

Sometimes I'm just alone
Sometimes I'm just sitting at home
Sometimes I'm just alone
Sometimes I'm just sitting at home

Get high with me
On the corner of Main Street
Get high with me
Get high with me
On the corner of Main Street
Get high with me

Sometimes I'm just alone
Sometimes I'm just sitting at home
Sometimes I'm just alone
Sometimes I'm just sitting at home

Get high with me
On the corner of Main Street
Get high with me
Get high with me
On the corner of Main Street
Get high with me

All I want to do
And all I want to do
And all I want to do
Is get with you

All I want to do
And all I want to do
And all I want to do
Is get with you

Is get with you
Is get with you
Is get with you

"Heaven"
(from "Skate Kitchen" soundtrack)

Alone, for the last time
You're just a loner
Give it a try

And you're hard on yourself
And your laugh, it just melts in my hands
Lonesome in the streets
You say the mice all seem to laugh at me

I'll get by with you on my mind
I'll get by with you on my side
I'll get by with you on my mind
I'll get by with you on my side

I'm not at home
And I'll just say that
Being with you makes me feel less old

A kid on the street playing basketball
Horses will run forever, can't be called

I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
Wish that I, wish that I
Wish that I could go back in time

I'll get by with you on my mind (on my mind)
I'll get by with you on my side (on my side)
I'll get by with you on my mind (on my mind)
I'll get by with you on my side

"I Don't Think I Can Do This Again"

Remember when we used to fight
I'd stay up all night
Trying to put it behind me

But was it really that long ago
Realize that I should let it go
Don't even know the time and the place

Call me when you get a second
Know it's been a minute since I've picked you up
We drove around so I opened the windows down

Don't ask any questions
Only have been here for three seconds
The party's ending, where's your friend

But I don't think I can do this again
I don't think I can do this again
I don't think I can do this again

But I don't think I can do this again
(Do this again) I don't think I can do this again

The grass is always green
But why did it used to feel
So much softer, longer, sweeter, cleaner than this

And I'm all in my head now
Don't you see what you've done now
Missing all the things, I wouldn't of loved

Call me when you get a second
Know it's been a while since we talked it out
We're missing, I'm so young and we're so full of doubt

And I've been thinking
Of you, in love, you

Do you remember it too
Remember it too
Remember it too

I don't think I can do this again
(Do this again) I don't think I can do this again
(Do this again) I don't think I can do this again
(Do this again) Remember it too

I don't think I can do this again

"Lavender"

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

When I'm with you I'll be
When I'm with you I'll be alright
When I'm with you I'll
When I'm with you I'll be alright

Once in a while
I start to fall in love again
Only been some time, and so
I don't know why I can't let you go

'Til the break of day
'Til the night I sleep
No one beats you, baby
No one takes your place from me

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

"Sis"

Feelings are so fragile
Egos are always wants

Ship in a bottle collapses on to myself oh
Your soft skin unbroken sin next to my rough calluses
Mild kiss, sleep paralysis
Tell me more about your sister

Brittle bones hold my body together
Tender touches mend me with feathers oh

Guess I know
Guess I know
Guess I know

Oh

"I Don't Wanna Be Funny Anymore"

I don't wanna be funny anymore
I don't wanna be funny anymore
Lately, I've been feeling like the odd man out
I hurt my friends saying things I don't mean out loud

I don't wanna be funny anymore
I got a too short skirt, maybe I can be the cute one
Is there room in the band I don't need to be the front man
If not, then I'll be the biggest fan

I don't want the joke to be on me
Yeah, I'll buy the clothes and I'll be the best dressed
Yeah, I'll read the books and I'll be the smartest
I'll play guitar and I'll be the artist

Try not to laugh
I know it'll be hard
I'm serious
I know it's a first but

I don't wanna be funny anymore
Yeah, I'll be the gossip, hear it through the grape vine
Pass it on, she's done with the old times
That funny girl doesn't wanna smile for a while

"Troublemaker Doppelganger"

Is that a hearse or a limousine
It's like I've seen it on the TV screen
She had the body of a beauty queen
Put on a pedestal for good hygiene

I saw a girl that looked like you
And I wanted to tell everyone to run away from her
Run away, run away
It couldn't have been you but she had your eyes
Made for faking smiles and turning tides
Hands full of young men wrapped around her finger

They made you a throne out of magazines
They made you a crown out of peonies
She grew up as the pretty young thing
Let them look up her skirt on the backyard swing
Oh no

Daddy told you to stay indoors
And I can understand how a girl gets bored-
Too old to play and too young to mess around
She was a victim of the same disease
That's roaming the streets and bites when it please
And makes us wanna live forever or die in infamy

I wanna live in a world where I can keep my doors wide open
But who knows what'd get in and what'd get out
One of these nights, I'll sleep with the windows down
But not until that creature's in the pound

No child is born knowing there's an ugly or evil thing
When did my folks stop covering my eyes
Was it my brother who taught me about jealousy
Was it my sister who taught me about vanity
Was it that girl, that beautiful girl
Thirsty for love and eager for attention
Was it that girl who taught me about destruction

I wanna live in a world where I can keep my doors wide open
But who knows what'd get in and what'd get out

"Green Eyes, Red Face"

Slow dancing
At low tide, low tide
Drawn to move
By the moon, by the moon

And I see the seat next to yours is unoccupied
And I was wondering if you'd let me come and sit by your side
I've got plenty of affection
I'd be glad to show you some time

Slow motion
In double time, double time
You are all
I can't deny

And I see the seat next to yours is unoccupied
And I was wondering if you'd let me come and sit by your side
I've got plenty of affection
I'd be glad to show you some time

What am I supposed to do
With you in the room
What am I supposed to say
With your green eyes on my red face
With your green eyes on my red face

"Strange Torpedo"

You got yourself a bunch of bad habits
Not hard to see that love is a weakness
Seems to me, the way you understand it
Is that you're never gonna make it happen

I get smoke in my eyes every time I try
To look you in the eye
Do I even know what your face looks like
Or just the cloud of smoke in it's place
I'm trying to tell you something you might've heard before

You got a dollar in your pocket
You got a pebble in your sock and
You've got a mind of gold you keep secret
I gotta hope that one day you'll use it

I get tongue-tied every time I try
To tell you what I think is right
Cause I think it's wrong when you sit around
Looking like a toy in the lost and found
I am telling you something you might've heard before
And forgot on the spot

You're a strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
And I'll play the fool, and I'll play the fool

I see the blood rushing to your head
Your words are slurred and your cheeks are red
You'd do anything to stop pretending
Can't have regrets when you can't remember them

You are one of a kind, I cannot lie
You're wild when your body's in overdrive
And I'm more surprised every time you're alive
When I check for your breath in the morning

You're a strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
And I'll play the fool, and I'll play the fool

I thought you'd hit rock bottom
But I'm starting to think that it doesn't exist
Cause you've been falling for so long
And you haven't hit anything solid yet

I thought you'd hit rock bottom
But I'm starting to think that it doesn't exist
Cause you've been falling for so long
And you haven't hit anything solid yet

You're a strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
And I'll play the fool, and I'll play the fool, and I'll play the fool

"Dream State..."

We woke up to the thunder
We huddled under covers
We didn't say anything
If you hadn't come over
I would be so much colder
I would be much less confused

And then the water came
And washed it all away
It left me with nothing to say
Could not believe my eyes
I could not recognize
Your face in the rubble

Without you, I am surely the last of our kind
Without you, I am surely the last of my kind

We had a lot to measure
We had more past than pleasure
And time grows deep like weeds
You catch me when I'm falling
Sometimes, I wish you wouldn't
I can't tell if I'm learning

And then the water came
And washed it all away
It left me with nothing to say
Could not believe my eyes
I could not recognize
Your face in the rubble

Without you I am surely the last of our kind
Without you I am surely the last of my kind
Without you I am surely the last of our kind
Without you I am surely the last of my kind
Without you I am surely the last of our kind
Without you I am surely the last of my kind

"Trust"

I set a fire on the stove
And fed it every word I wrote
I watched my journals turn to smoke
Now all there is is what I spoke

I decided long ago
To make the most of what I know
And worry not of what I don't
Perfect the art of letting go

Cause if I trust in something else
Then I don't need to trust myself
I've learned a lot since I began
But I think I was wiser then

I've done too much and not enough
In trying to put you above
I cannot tell if I'm in love
Or whose regard I'm thinking of

If beauty is the only way
To make the nightmares go away
I'll plant a garden in your brain
And let the roots absorb the pain

I set a fire to my soul
I hope it ate til it was full
I set a fire to my soul
It burned me and it made me whole

"Map On A Wall"

Oh please, don't make fun of me
Of my crooked smile and my crowded teeth
Of my pigeon feet, of my knobby knees
Well, I got more problems than not

But I feel fine and I made up my mind
To live happily, feeling beautiful beneath the trees
Above a ground that's solid at the core
Oh please, don't make fun of me
Oh you know I get frightened so easily
When I'm all alone and the floorboards creak
It's those noises in the dark

But I am alive and I made up my mind
To live fearlessly, running wild beneath the trees
Above a ground that's solid at the core

Send my regards to the north my friends
I am built for the heat, I regret to admit
My fear of freezing keeps me on my feet
And so far my whole life's one long lucky streak
They say you should take the credit when it comes
But I believe in haunted wood

Oh please, don't make fun of me
Oh I'll try my best to tell it like it is
But I'll bite my tongue and I'll close my lips
When nobody wants to hear it

But here we are and something about it doesn't feel like an accident
We're all looking for something to adore
And how to survive the bending and breaking

I've walked on two legs since I was a child
But when did I realize that some ways out
Past the horizon for thousands of miles
There are people like me, walking on legs like mine

Coming closer and farther away
Coming to me and from my embrace
Hoping good comes from good
And good comes from bad anyway

Oh please, don't make fun of me
With my heart of gold and my restless soul
Oh please, don't make fun of me
This smile happens genuinely

If you want to see the world, you have to say goodbye
Cause a map does no good hanging on a wall
If you want to see the world, you have to say goodbye
Cause a map does no good hanging on a wall

"Direct Address"

You know it's unfair that I am here and you are there
I feel short in the exchange- I show you mine you walk away
I'm wearing mine out on my sleeve, you're wearing yours where I can't see
But I'll remember your face for years to come
And wonder what you thought about when you got home

Honesty is like a kiss on the lips
Come closer and I'll tell you exactly how it is
Now I'm barely breathing, I'm moving ahead
But if I see you smile, it's gonna knock me dead

I'm stiff in my tracks trying to recover
From whatever drug you used to put me under

I don't believe in love at first sight
I don't believe in love at first sight
It's hard enough for me to not fall in love with every person I see

I let my mind get turned inside out
Just to see what the kids were laughing about
It wasn't worth understanding something
I could've gone my whole life not knowing

You know what they say about curiosity
That murderer had his chokehold on me
I ran away without turning back
But every now and then I want what I can't have

I'm still thinking of a man from years ago-
Eyes open wide in the front row
Dark features, leaning on the doorframe
I would've sold my soul to know his first name

I don't believe in love at first sight
I don't believe in love at first sight
I don't believe in love at first sight
Maybe I would if you looked at me right

"...Familiar Place"

I came through the backyard
You let the garden die
How did I get here
How did I get here
What did I do to deserve this

The mountain was taller than I could've fathomed
I hardly believe it from here at the bottom
I can't imagine why you'd want to be at the top
Oh my god, what will I do if you ever stop

Without you, I am surely the last of our kind
Without you, I am surely the last of my kind

"Night Shift"

The first time I tasted somebody else's spit, I had a coughing fit
I mistakenly called them by your name
I was let down it wasn't the same

I'm doing fine, trying to derail my one track mind
Regaining my self-worth in record time
But I can't help but think of your other in the bed that was mine

Am I a masochist, resisting urges to punch you in the teeth, call you a bitch and leave
Why did I come here To sit and watch you stare at your feet
What was the plan Absolve your guilt and shake hands

I feel no need to forgive but I might as well
But let me kiss your lips so I know how it felt
Pay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down
Walk for hours in the dark feeling all hell

Don't hold your breath, forget you ever saw me at my best
You don't deserve what you don't respect
Don't deserve what you say you love and then neglect

Now bite your tongue, it's too dangerous to fall so young
Take back what you said
Can't lose what you never had

I feel no need to forgive but I might as well
But let me kiss your lips so I know how it felt
Pay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down
Walk for hours in the dark feeling all hell

You got a 9 to 5, so I'll take the night shift
And I'll never see you again if I can help it
In five years I hope the songs feel like covers
Dedicated to new lovers

You got a 9 to 5, so I'll take the night shift
And I'll never see you again if I can help it
In five years I hope the songs feel like covers
Dedicated to new lovers

You got a 9 to 5, so I'll take the night shift
And I'll never see you again if I can help it
In five years I hope the songs feel like covers
Dedicated to new lovers

"Addictions"

Freeze frame, tidal wave in the passenger side
I'm still a nervous kid after all this time
Can you imagine what it's like to be here with you now
Forget your current lover, remember me that one July
Lay in bed, black under oaths, watching the planes at night
I knew one day it'd be so hard to have you by my side

Now I'm awake at 2AM
Without a cause to draw you in

Buy low, sell high kind of guy
Invest your time in what's worthwhile
Was I a risk without reward or did I make you proud

Now I'm awake at 2AM
Without a cause to draw you in

I'm just calling 'cause I'm used to it
You pick up 'cause you're not a quitter
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too

You've been around the world and back
Always return to the ones you love
You've got a sense of adventure
An adventure for comfort that keeps you at home

I'm just calling 'cause I'm used to it
You pick up 'cause you're not a quitter
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too

Releasing
Years of senseless waiting
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too

"The Shell"

I'm a ghost
Walking in a boring dream
You are there
Talking and I'm not listening
I am busy doing nothing
And you're rudely interrupting

It's a myth and now I see it clearly
You don't have to be sad to make something worth hearing
Now I'm calm and content
One more burden off my back

You don't wanna be a creator
Doesn't mean you've got nothing to say
Put down the pen, don't let it force your hand

I'm a ghost
Walking on an empty street
No name anymore
No need to call for me
I'm a long-lost hometown hero
Late to legendary past lives within me

If I had the offer to do it again
Make me invincible, invisible, or brain dead
If the body and the life were two things that we could divide
I'd deliver up my shell to be filled with somebody else

You don't wanna be a creator
Doesn't mean you've got nothing to say
Put down the pen, don't let it force your hand

You don't wanna be a leader
Doesn't mean you don't know the way
Hold your own hand, walk on without a plan

"Nonbeliever"

You threw your books into the river
Told your Mom that you're a non-believer
She says she wasn't surprised but that doesn't make it ok

You say nobody loves a city
Nobody loves what can't love 'em back
One-way ticket in your pocket
What happened to the charm of a small town

If you find what you're looking for
Be sure to send a postcard
You promised you'd never forget
The little ones when you got big

You deal an unspoken debt
No kindness without wanting something back
What do I owe you What did I forget
Are we even after all of that

You shook my hand and said goodbye
You'll never let me see you cry again
What good has come from learning to pretend
You said I could've been a better friend

If you find what you're looking for
Be sure to send a new address
And if you find what you're looking for
Write a letter and tell us what it is, and tell us what it is

Everybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out
Everybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out
Everybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out
Everybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out

"Yours & Mine"

I'm afraid of pain
Both yours and mine
Both yours and mine
I'm afraid of pain
From where it comes
And where it falls

Somebody lit the store on fire
Somebody lit the house on fire
Somebody lit the crowd on fire
Marching away and you've got nothing to say
You've got nothing to say
Have you got nothing to say

For those of you who told me I should stay indoors
Take care of you and yours
Take care of you and yours
But me and mine (me and mine)
Me and mine (me and mine)
We've got a long way to go
Before we get home
'Cause this ain't my home anymore
This ain't my home anymore
This ain't my home

Somebody lit the store on fire
Somebody lit the house on fire
Somebody lit the crowd on fire
Marching away and you've got nothing to say
You've got nothing to say
Have you got nothing to say

For those of you who told me I should stay indoors
Take care of you and yours
Take care of you and yours
But me and mine (me and mine)
Me and mine (me and mine)
We've got a long way to go
Before we get home
'Cause this ain't my home anymore
This ain't my home anymore
This ain't my home

Take care of you and yours
Take care of you and yours
Take care of you and yours
Take care of you and yours
But me and mine (me and mine)
Me and mine (me and mine)
Me and mine (me and mine)

This ain't my home anymore
This ain't my home anymore
This ain't my home anymore

"Body To Flame"

(Huh)
Longing for your short hair to grow back to the way you like
Thank you for the gesture
I regret ever implying that you could be better
Didn't mean to empty your perfect body
And fill it with my passing will

Easily won, weary of losing, gullible girl
Weak and alluring, well we break our rules
Get drunk in the dark
Laughing aloud at the spinning stars

Believe me, I'm speaking plainly and painfully
Trying to stay elegant, eloquent and akin to you
I see you holding your breath with your arms outstretched
Waiting for someone to come rip open your chest

You take me aside
To solemnly confide
When it comes the time
You plan to give your body to the flame

"Timefighter"

And I'll get old
And I'll get tired
And I won't run
Into the water
You gotta let me go down
Will you remember me as I am now

And I know you're strong
I know you're a manmade fortress
But we're alone
And I'm so willing to be proven wrong

And I fight time
It won in a landslide
I'm just as good as anybody
I'm just as bad as anybody

You talk like you know the walls are thin
And I don't mind if you don't mind me listening
And I'm tired of all these wires
If I go far enough
Will they not follow us

And I fight time
It won in a landslide
I'm just as good as anybody
I'm just as bad as anybody

And I fight time
It won in a landslide
I'm just as good as anybody
I'm just as bad as anybody

"Next Of Kin"

Reading in the phone booth
Sucking on a ginger root
I never got to talk to you
Why is this the image I come back to
Pick my jewelry from the ash
Find the box with the cold hard cash in it
Give it to the next of kin

I used to be too deep inside my head
Now I'm too far out of my skin
Too far out of my skin
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed

I make a desert of my mind
Unfold myself so flat and wide
Have nothing in mind in sight
No cover for my thoughts to hide
Never entered my code
But I held your hand in the pocket of my coat
I learned to be loving and then to be alone
Satisfied body and a hungry soul

I used to be too deep inside my head
Now I'm too far out of my skin
Too far out of my skin
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed

I don't wanna be that man on the train
On a grey commute, imagining fame
Sweet relief, I will never be complete
I will never be complete
I'll never know everything
I will never be complete
I will never be complete
I will never be complete
I'll never know everything

I used to be too deep inside my head
Now I'm too far out of my skin
Too far out of my skin

"Pillar Of Truth"

Your hands are folded
Your eyes are closing
Your words are broken
Your eyes are dry

I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust
I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust

You are your mother's child
You're a mother of a mother of a mother now
Raised in the age of the milkman
I can't claim to understand

I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust
I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust

Lord, prepare me
For the shadows
For the sparrows
At my window
Lord, have mercy
On my descendants
For they know not
What they do
For they know not
Who you are
And they know not
What to do

I, the anchor
I'm slowly sinking
Into darkness
Yet unknown
But the fading
Light around me
Is full of faces
Who carry my name

I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust
I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust

Lord, be near me
My final hour
I once had sight
But now I'm blind
Oh, I tried to be
A second coming
And if I want
Nobody knew
If my throat can't sing
Then my soul
Screams out to you

I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust
I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust

"Historians"

You said "Don't go changing
I'll rearrange to let you in
And I'll be your historian
And you'll be mine
And I'll fill pages of scribbled ink
Hoping the words carry meaning"

Then one day, the motorcade
Covered in flower wreaths
First in a big parade
Will come to take one of us away
Leaving the other with plenty to read

This is what I want to talk about
But somehow the words will not leave my mouth
Was I most complete at the beginning Or the bow
If past you were to meet future me
Would you be holding me here and now

"Fool's Gold"

I drank the dregs of the champagne alone
Warm, flat, coppery coins down my throat
I'm saving up for a rainy day
And I plan to spend it in one place
I threw the party so I could stay put
You brought the bottle like a promise I forgot
A new year begins, it ushers us in
The knot in my gut is coming with

He'll blame the alcohol
And you'll blame the full moon
She'll blame the fall of man
But I blame the part of you
That can't let up on the reigns
You've got life in a chokehold
You say that it's all the same
All glittering fool's gold

I can't tell how big my heart is
Let's open the doors, see how many fit
Like drunks in a bathtub keep piling in
Now I'm locking the door till the morning

He'll blame the alcohol
And you'll blame the full moon
She'll blame the fall of man
And I blame the evening news
For giving us doomsday
And dropping the ball
Building our fear
Like bricks in a wall
He'll blame his mom and dad
And you'll say you understand
She'll blame the wrath of God
And I come up empty-handed
Every time he cries out
You'll blame the altitude
She'll blame society
But I blame the part of you
That can't let up on the reigns
You've got life in a chokehold
You say that it's all the same
All glittering fool's gold

"My Mother & I"

My mother hates her body
We share the same outline
She swears that she loves mine
I blur at the edges
I'm all soft shapes and lines
Shapeshifting all the time

The stars have a lot to say
About babies born in the month of May
We are down-to-earth
We see eye-to-eye
We dig our feet in
My mother and I
My mother and I

They called me an old soul
When I was too young to know
The difference between a soul and a ghost
I feared what was inside
Trapped in my body
Kept from the outside
A spirit searching for a second life

The stars have a lot to say
About women born in the month of May
We want love
Warm and forever
We want to die in the presence of our loved ones
My mother and I
My mother and I

All she has given
All I have taken
All is forgiven
All is forsaken

"Forever Half Mast"

I'm takin' back roads all the way back home
Everything I've done, just a little lovely crow
I didn't choose this town, I can't undo it now
I tried to love the beast no matter what it thinks of me

You're worried that you'll go to Hell
For all the lives that you can't save
For all the money that you waste
For all the good you throw away

Yes, you're evil, but you're not that bad
You put out your palm more than the back of your hand
They were wrong when they said forget the past
Let your flag fly at forever half mast
Let your flag fly at forever half mast

We're in a state of disarray united by our darkest days
Achin' from the growing pains, they always say it's just a phase
America, the tried and true, red and white and black and blue
Tell me, who did this to you If it was me I hardly knew

Yes, you're evil, but you're not that bad
You put out your palm more than the back of your hand
They were wrong when they said forget the past
Let your flag fly at forever half mast
Let your flag fly at forever half mast

Off you run and run for more
Nobody escaped before
Wait for something magical
Mistake turn into miracle

"Last Christmas"

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognize me
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

Marry Christmas
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying "I love you", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover, but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love
You'll never fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

"Hot & Heavy"

Being back here makes me hot in the face
Hot blood in my pulsing veins
Heavy memories weighing on my brain
Hot and heavy in the basement of your parents' place
You used to be so sweet
Now you're a firecracker on a crowded street
Couldn't look away even if I wanted
Try to walk away but I come back to the start

Get me to the floor even though I'm not a dancer
Ask me all the questions that your parents wouldn't answer
How could I deny it, diamond in the rough
You let me in your world until you had enough
You knew that I wanted you to bend the rules
How did I believe I had a hold on you
You were always stronger than people suspected
Underestimated and overprotected
When I went away it was the only option
Couldn't trust myself to proceed with caution
The most that I could give to you is nothing at all
The best that I could offer was to miss your calls

Being back here makes me hot in the face
Hot blood in my pulsing veins
Heavy memories weighing on my brain
Hot and heavy in the basement of your parents' place
You used to be so sweet
Now you're a firecracker on a crowded street
Couldn't look away even if I wanted
Try to walk away but I come back to the start

And it happens over and over, and over and over again
Over and over, and over and over again
I wish I was over it, over it, over it, over it

A hidden gem, my own goldmine
You had the wide and wild eyes
You were a secret to yourself
You couldn't keep from anyone else
Now you're the biggest brightest flame
You are a fire that can't be tamed
You're better than ever, but I knew you when
It's bittersweet to see you again

"Christine"

You're falling asleep on my shoulder in the back of your boyfriend's car
We're coming home from a sermon saying how bent and evil we are
I tried to imagine what you're dreaming, you're muttering nonsense between steady breathing
I have to wake you up to get out, your man waves from the end of the drive 'til I'm in the house

He can be nice, sometimes
Other nights, you admit he's not what you had in mind
All in all, nobody's perfect
There may be better, but you don't feel worth it
That's where we disagree

You always wanted to raise a baby by the lake
Maybe they'll grow up and never make the same mistakes
Knowing you, they'd be the first kid to never hurt another
I see you look at him and wonder if he'll make you a mother

But if you get married, I'd object
Throw my shoe at the altar and lose your respect
I'd rather lose my dignity
Than lose you to somebody who won't make you happy

"First Time"

Broke into the screened-in porch
Now I'm crawling through the dog door
I may let you see me on my knees
But you never see me on all fours

Drooling on the tile
I'm a starfish on the kitchen floor
Catch my breath to breathe your name
I'm just the fool you took me for

You can feel it for the first time, the second time
You can feel it for the first time, the second time

You gave me your hands 'cause you
Didn't know what to with them
And I showed you the way
Even though I'd never been

Where did we go right
I think about it all the time
If I had paid closer attention
Maybe I could take us back to there and then

You can feel it for the first time, the second time
You can feel it for the first time, the second time
I can't go back to who I was before I met you
I can't undo with I've done, I wouldn't want to
I wouldn't want to, I wouldn't want to

Sneaking out of the house
I must be out of my mind
I'm running out of excuses
We're running out of time

You say the love will come and go
We'll learn to rude the ebb and flow
You always leave before the light
Come back, same time and place the next night

And how will I know if history repeats itself
How will I know when it's gonna come back around
How will I know Has my face changed, baby
How will I know I'll stay ready for you to take me
Take me, take me
Take me

"VBS"

In the summer of '07 I was sure I'd go to heaven
But I was hedging my bets at VBS
The preacher in a t-shirt told me I could be a leader
Taught me how to build a fire and to spread the word

In the evening everybody went to worship and weep
Hands above our heads, reaching for God
Back in the cabin, snorting nutmeg in your bunk bed
You were waiting for a revelation of your own

Sedentary secrets like peach pits in your gut
Locked away like jam jars in the cellar of your heart
Waiting to be tasted and ultimately wasted
You were gonna win me over from the start

The poetry was so bad
It took a lot to not laugh
You said that I showed you the light
But all it did in the end
Was make the dark feel darker than before

Your dad keeps his sleeves down through the summer for a reason
Your mother wears her makeup extra thick for a reason
When I tell you you were born and you are here for a reason
You are not convinced the reason is a good one

While you're going to sleep your mind keeps you awake
And it makes your heart beat fast and loud
There's nothing you can do but the only thing you found
Playing Slayer at full volume helps to block it out

The poetry was so bad
It took a lot to not laugh
You said that I showed you the light
But all it did in the end
Was make the dark feel darker than before
Dark feel darker than before
Dark feel darker than before

"Cartwheel"

Here and there and gone again
Firefly juice on your skin
You're glowing like an atom bomb
This natural thing that you've undone
Outgrew older sister's clothes again
Won't admit you're growing tall and thin
You like your body pulling at the seams
You're not prepared for what the future brings

Curse words and empty cups
Cracked blacktop curling up
Heatwave by midday
Heat lightning on a summer night
And I remember when you used to call
Holed up in the closet in the hall
Scared you wouldn't live to 45
The same age as your father when he died
You'd say, "We need to talk
Sneak out, meet me on your block"
I'd sit by you, silent on the curb
What to say when there is not a word
Spell broke at daybreak
Light another candle on the cake
Cartwheel and a broken wrist
Skin scarred and sun-kissed

When you told me 'bout your first time
A soccer player at the senior high
I felt my body crumple to the floor-
Betrayal like I'd never felt before
I thought back to many years ago
A late night promise on the telephone
We'd build a house of twigs and vines
Grow old together just to pass the time
Now there's only past and present day
I can't believe a word you say
The future isn't worth its weight in gold
The future is a benevolent black hole

"Thumbs"

You hung up the phone
And I asked you what was wrong
Your dad has come to town
He'd like to meet
I said "You don't have to see him"
But for whatever reason you can't tell him no

So we meet him at a bar
You were holding my hand hard
He ordered rum and coke
I can't drink either anymore
He hadn't seen you since the fifth grade
Now you're nineteen and you're five-eight
He said "Honey, you sure look great
Do you get the checks I send on your birthday"

I would kill him
If you let me
I would kill him
Quick and easy
Your nails are digging
Into my knee
I don't know
How you keep smiling

I love your eyes
And he has them
But you have his
'Cause he was first
I imagine my thumbs on the irises
Pressing in until they burst

I clear my throat
And say we ought to get home
He offers us a ride
I reply "No, that's alright"
When we leave
You feel him watching
So we walk a mile in the wrong direction

I would kill him
If you let me
I would kill him
Quick and easy
Your nails are digging
Into my knee
I don't know
How you keep smiling
I don't know
How you keep smiling
I don't know
How you keep smiling

I wanna take your face between my hands and say
"You two are connected by a pure coincidence
Bound to him by blood, but baby, it's all relative
You've been in his fist ever since you were a kid
But you don't owe him shit even if he said you did
You don't owe him shit even if he said you did"

"Going Going Gone"

Daniel made a pass
We started flirting after class
Stealing hats and trading jackets
Locking lips and braces brackets
After dinner, before dark
We'd meet at the same bench in the park
Sweaty palms, averted eyes
Wasn't sure if he and I were going out

Going out
Going out, ooh
Going, going, out

The sunset threw a tantrum
It wasn't ready to go just yet
Mother Earth said, "Time for bed"
It resisted and the sky went red
The color filtered out
Like pulling teeth out of a cloud
The bloody battle ended
No, the sun can't break the habit of going down

Going down
Going down, ooh
Going, going, down

Daniel in ten years
Grabbing asses, spilling beers
Another ten and he'll have a daughter
She'll grow up and he can't stop her
Back on the bench, making plans
Watching the day end hand in hand
I always had to be home by eight
My dad would kill me if I was late
I'll be going now

Going now
Going now, ooh
Going, going, now

Going gone
Going gone
Going gone, ooh
Going, going, gone

"Cool, yeah that was the one I think"
"Yup that was great, that's what we were looking for. Thanks guys"
"Cool, wow I am so happy. Thank you everyone for doing this. I owe y'all whatever you ask of me for the rest of my life"

"Partner in Crime"

When I asked you to coffee
Could you tell I don't drink it
When I got to the caf
Could you tell what I was thinking
My heart's on my sleeve, it's embarrassing
The pulpy thing, beating

When you asked my age, I lied
I saw relief dawn on your eyes
It's not your fault, it's mine
Let the record show
I walked in on my own

Knee deep in the city that never sleeps
I lay down in the middle of the street
Lamplight like parallel suns
Crowding out the early morning stars
Concrete holding heat from the daytime
Picking petals to see if you will be mine

Do you love me, do you love me not
Do you love me, do you love me not
Do you love me, do you love me not
Do you love me, do you love me, not

You were my partner in crime
It was a welcome waste of time
Eating cherries on the bridge, feet dangling
Throwing the pits and stems into the racing current below
I get vertigo looking down, and looking in

Drop me off at the curb by my curfew
Round the corner so nobody sees you
You drop a hint that you got a girlfriend
I tried my best not to take it
I wanna run my fingers through you
You say nobody understands you like I do

But do you love me, do you love me not
Do you love me, do you love me not
Do you love me, do you love me not
Do you love me, do you love me, not

"Brando"

You told me to skip school
To go with you to the movies
You knew you were uncool
But you thought you could fool me
They play oldies in the afternoon
For the elderly, and me and you
Fred and Ginger, black and white
I watch you watch 'It's a Wonderful Life'

You called me cerebral
I didn't know what you meant
But now I do, would it have killed you
To call me pretty instead
I'm in a second story window
And you're yelling at me "Stella"
And I'm laughing 'cause you think you're Brando
But you'll never come close

All I need for you to admit
Is that you never knew me like you thought you did
You never knew me like you thought you did
Like you thought you did

You say, "Here's looking at you kid"
Thinking I wouldn't understand the reference
You admit, you think we're fated
I'll be lucky if I'm your third wife
That's only something you would say in the car
We've been breathing the same air for too long
If the snow wasn't coming down so hard
I would open the door and walk home
It's only a couple miles
What could go wrong
If I hitch a ride with a guy in a pick-up
Who doesn't know left, from right, from wrong

All I need for you to admit
Is that you never knew me like you thought you did
You never knew me like you thought you did
Like you thought you did

All I need for you to admit
Is that you never knew me like you thought you did
You never knew me like you thought you did
Like you thought you did

"Please Stay"

Your clothes in the dryer
Your hair on the shower wall
Your toothbrush is too much
Your shoes empty in the hall
Your keys on the counter
Your dirty dish in the sink
Please, don't make me see these things

The books on your shelf that you never read
The hunting knife you kept by your bed
The flowers you dried and tied up with twine
Suspended from the ceiling

You tell me you love me, like it'll be the last time
Like you're playing out, the end of a storyline
I say I love you too, because it's true
What else am I supposed to do
Maybe bar the door when you move to leave

I think you mean what you say
When you say you wanna die
I think you mean what you say
When you say you want to stay alive

Quit your job
Cut your hair
Get a dog
Change your name
Change your mind
Change your ways
Give them time
Go back to school, go back to sleep
Tell the secret you can't keep
Begin, be done
Break a vow, make a new one
Call me if you need a friend, or never talk to me again

But please stay
But please stay
But please stay
But please stay

"Triple Dog Dare"

I'm not tired yet
We still got a lot to figure out
Like what was the end of the movie about, anyways
You're yawning on your couch
I wonder if I overstayed my welcome
Until you asked me if I'd like to take a walk
We're going to the five and dime
The only open place at this time of night
You're dancing in the aisle 'cause the radio
Is singing you a song you know
And the kid at the counter is gawking at your grace
I can tell what he's thinking by the look on his face
It's not his fault, I'm sure I look the same
It's what you do but it's not you I blame

Your mama read my palm
She wouldn't tell me what it was she saw
But after that, you weren't allowed to spend the night
I'm staring at my hands
Red, ruddy skin, I don't understand
How did they betray me What did I do
I never touched you how I wanted to
What can I say to your mom to let you come outside
You know I'll be seeking if you run and hide
If the door were to open, would you walk through the frame
If you're too afraid, it won't be you I blame

You passed a note in class
Told me to meet you at the overpass
Your lip was trembling when you said that we are cursed
You're trying not to cry
When you tell me you're afraid that we may die
I said "So what Everybody's scared of that"
I want you to tell me that you miss me
Want you to hold and hurt and kiss me
I wanna run away and live on your family's boat
It's a triple dog dare, you're a chicken if you don't
I can fish for our food and you know how to start a flame
If you don't get out now you'll only have yourself to blame

You said, "You have me there
If it's a triple dog dare"
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare

They put our faces on the milk jugs
Missing children 'til they gave up
Your mama was right, and through the grief
Can't fight the feeling of relief
Nothing worse could happen now
Nothing worse could happen now
Nothing worse could happen now

"Kissing Lessons"

Rachel was a year older
When I was in the second grade
I thought she might know everything
I took her word like a golden ring
I asked her how to win my man
And she said, "I know just the thing"
Gave me lipgloss and a hair toss
And, after school, a lesson in kissing

She called me by the name of a crush
I couldn't decide if she was Cole or Justin
I think I called her baby or darling most the time

We'd take turns being seduced
Imagining the day it would come into use
Imagining the day we'd start breaking hearts
And taking names

She wanted a three-story house
I wanted to live by a body of water
With my children and their father
Children and their father
Three sons and a beautiful daughter (Oh)

Rachel's family moved out of town
I don't remember when we stopped hanging out
But I still wear a letter R charm on my bracelet
And wonder if she thinks of me as her first kiss

"Thumbs Again"

You hung up the phone
And I asked you what was wrong
Your dad has come to town
He'd like to meet
I said, "You don't have to see him"
But for whatever reason, you can't tell him no

So we meet him at a bar
You were holding my hand hard
He ordered rum and Coke
I can't drink either anymore
He hadn't seen you since the fifth grade
Now you're nineteen and you're 5'8"
He said, "Honey, you sure look great
Do you get the checks I send on your birthday"

I would kill him
If you let me
I would kill him
Quick and easy
Your nails are digging
Into my knee
I don't know how you keep smiling

I love your eyes
And he has 'em
Or you have his
'Cause he was first
I imagine my thumbs on the irises
Pressing in until they burst

I clear my throat
And say we ought to get home
He offers us a ride
I reply, "No, that's alright"
And when we leave
You feel him watching
So we walk a mile in the wrong direction

I would kill him
If you let me
I would kill him
Quick and easy
Your nails are digging
Into my knee
I don't know how you keep smiling

I wanna take your face between my hands and say
"You two are connected by a pure coincidence
Bound to him by blood, but baby, it's all relative
You've been in his fist ever since you were a kid
But you don't owe him shit even if he said you did
You don't owe him shit even if he said you did"

"brutal"

I want it to be, like, messy

I'm so insecure, I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I if not exploited
And I'm so sick of seventeen
Where's my fucking teenage dream
If someone tells me one more time
"Enjoy your youth," I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious, and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more

All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get
Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here

(Yeah)

I feel like no one wants me
And I hate the way I'm perceived
I only have two real friends
And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
'Cause I love people I don't like
And I hate every song I write
And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart
And I can't even parallel park

All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get
Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here

(Yeah)
(Just havin' a really good time)

Got a broken ego, broken heart
(Yeah, it's brutal out here, yeah, it's brutal out here)
And God, I don't even know where to start

"traitor"

Brown guilty eyes and little white lies
Yeah, I played dumb but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

And ain't it funny
How you ran to her
The second that we called it quits

And ain't it funny
How you said you were friends
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

You talked to her
When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter

It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still a traitor

Now you bring her around
Just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy

And I know if you were true
There's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

Ain't it funny
All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid

Ain't it funny
Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

You talked to her
When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter

It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still a traitor

God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
When she's sleeping in the bed we made
Don't you dare forget about the way

You betrayed me
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah

You talked to her
When we were together
You gave me your word
But that didn't matter

It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still

You're still a traitor
Yeah, you're still a traitor

God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you

"drivers license"

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else

And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
Oh, and I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street

Red lights
Stop signs
I still see your face
In the white cars
Front yards
Can't drive past the places
We used to
Go to
'Cause I still fucking love you, babe

Sidewalks
We crossed
I still hear your voice
In the traffic
We're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue
Know we're through
But I still fucking love you, babe

I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever now I drive alone past your street

"1 step forward, 3 steps back"

Called you on the phone today
Just to ask you how you were
All I did was speak normally
Somehow I still struck a nerve

You got me fucked up in the head, boy
Never doubted myself so much
Like am I pretty Am I fun, boy
I hate that I gave you power over that kind of stuff

'Cause it's always one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me, boy I don't understand
No, I don't understand

And maybe in some masochistic way
I kind of find it all exciting
Like which lover will I get today
Will you walk me to the door or send me home cryin'

It's one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me, boy I don't understand

No, it's back and forth, did I say something wrong
It's back and forth, going over everything I said
It's back and forth, did I do something wrong
It's back and forth, maybe, this is all your fault instead

It's one step forward and three steps back
And I'd leave you, but the roller coaster's all I've ever had
Yeah, it's one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me, boy
I don't understand
No, I don't understand

"deja vu"

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin' 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin' in harmony
I bet she's braggin'
To all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you

Do you get dj vu when she's with you
Do you get dj vu Ah, hmm
Do you get dj vu, huh

Do you call her, almost say my name
'Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
'Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (I love you)

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the song she's singing now when she's with you

Do you get dj vu when she's with you
Do you get dj vu (Oh-oh)
Do you get dj vu

Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel
A different girl now, but there's nothing new

I know you get dj vu
I know you get dj vu
I know you get dj vu

"good 4 u"

Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world

And good for you, I guess that you've been working on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well good for you, I guess you're getting everything you want
You bought a new car and your career's really taking off
It's like we never even happened, baby
What the fuck is up with that

And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you
Well, screw that and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all

Well good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doing great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath

I've lost my mind
I've spent the night
Crying on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well good for you, I guess you moved on really easily

"enough for you"

I wore make-up when we dated
'Cause I thought you'd like me more
If I looked like the other prom queens
I know that you loved before
Tried so hard to be everything that you like
Just for you to say you're not the compliment type

And I knew how you took your coffee
And your favourite songs by heart
I read all of your self-help books so you'd think that I was smart
Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me
I knew from the start this is exactly how you'd leave

You found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
Yeah all I ever wanted was to be enough for you

And maybe I'm just not as interesting as the girls you had before
But God, you couldn't have cared less about
Someone who loved you more
I'd say you broke my heart
But you broke much more than that
Now, I don't want your sympathy
I just want myself back before

You found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough

Don't you think I loved you too much
To be used and discarded
Don't you think I loved you too much
To think I deserve nothing
But don't tell me you're sorry, boy
Feel sorry for yourself
'Cause someday, I'll be everything to somebody else

And they'll think that I'm so exciting
And you'll be the one who's cryin'
Yeah, you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
You say I'm never satisfied
But that's not me, it's you

'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough
But I don't think anything could ever be enough
For you
Enough for you
No, nothing's enough for you

"happier"

We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine
You know I know you've moved on
Found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you

And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet
She's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me

Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know
I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy but don't be happier

And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me

And now I'm picking her apart
Like cutting her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful
She looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know
I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better

I hope you're happy
I wish you all the best
Really
Say you love her, baby
Just not like you loved me
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy
But don't be happier

I hope you're happy
Just not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know
Can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy but don't be happier

"jealousy, jealousy"

I kinda wanna throw my phone across the room
'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true
With paper-white teeth and perfect bodies
Wish I didn't care

I know their beauty's not my lack
But it feels like that weight is on my back
And I can't let it go

Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself
I'd rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
My jealousy, jealousy started followin' me (He-he-he, he)
Started followin' me (He-he-he, he)

And I see everyone gettin' all the things I want
I'm happy for them, but then again, I'm not
Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos
I can't stand it
Oh God, I sound crazy

Their win is not my loss
I know it's true, but
I can't help gettin' caught up in it all

Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
I'm so sick of myself
Rather be, rather be
Anyone, anyone else
My jealousy, jealousy (Yeah)

All your friends are so cool, you go out every night
In your daddy's nice car, yeah, you're livin' the life
Got a pretty face, a pretty boyfriend, too
I wanna be you so bad and I don't even know you
All I see is what I should be
Happier, prettier, jealousy, jealousy
All I see is what I should be
I'm losin' it, all I get's jealousy, jealousy

Com-comparison is killin' me slowly
I think I think too much
'Bout kids who don't know me
And I'm so sick of myself
Rather be, rather be (Oh, oh)
Anyone, anyone else (Anybody else)
Jealousy, jealousy
Oh, I'm so sick of myself
I'd rather be, rather be (Oh-oh-oh)
Anyone, anyone else
Jealousy, jealousy started followin' me

"favorite crime"

Know that I loved you so bad
I let you treat me like that
I was your willing accomplice, honey

And I watched as you fled the scene
Doe-eyed as you buried me
One heart broke, four hands bloody

The things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

You used me as an alibi
I crossed my heart as you crossed the line
And I defended you to all my friends

And now, every time a siren sounds
I wonder if you're around
'Cause you know that I'd do it all again

Oh, the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

It's bittersweet to think about the damage that we'd do
'Cause I was going down, but I was doing it with you
Yeah, everything we broke, and all the trouble that we made
But I say that I hate you with a smile on my face

Oh, look what we became

Oh, the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
Oh, the things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

Your favorite crime
Your favorite crime
'Cause baby, you were mine

"hope ur ok"

I knew a boy once, when I was small
A tow-head blond, with eyes of salt
He played the drum in the marching band
His parents cared more about the Bible
Than being good to their own child
He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad

And somehow, we fell out of touch
Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush
Don't know if I'll see you again someday
But if you're out there, I hope that you're OK

My middle school friend grew up alone
She raised her brothers on her own
Her parents hated who she loved
She couldn't wait to go to college
She was tired 'cause she was brought
Into a world where family was merely blood

Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
We don't talk much but I just gotta say
"I miss you, and I hope that you're OK."

Address the letters, to the holes in my butterfly wings
Nothing's forever, nothing's as good as it seems
And when the clouds won't iron out
And the monsters creep into your house
And every door is hard to close

Well, I hope you know how proud I am you were created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
God, I hope that you're happier today
'Cause I love you, and I hope that you're OK

"all-american bitch"

I am light as a feather, I'm as stiff as a board
I pay attention to things that most people ignore
And I'm alright with the movies
That make jokes 'bout senseless cruelty, that's for sure
And I am built like a mother and a total machine
I feel for your every little issue, I know just what you mean
And I make light of the darkness
I've got sun in my motherfuckin' pocket, best believe
Yeah, you know me, I

Forgive, and I forget
I know my age, and I act like it
Got what you can't resist
I'm a perfect all-American

I am light as a feather, I'm as fresh as the air
Coca-Cola bottles that I only use to curl my hair
I got class and integrity
Just like a goddamn Kennedy, I swear
With love to spare, I

Forgive, and I forget
I know my age, and I act like it
Got what you can't resist
I'm a perfect all-American bitch
With perfect all-American lips
And perfect all-American hips
I know my place
I know my place, and this is it

I don't get angry when I'm pissed
I'm the eternal optimist
I scream inside to deal with it, like, "Ah"
Like, "Ah" (Oh my fucking God)

All the time
I'm grateful all the time
I'm sexy, and I'm kind
I'm pretty when I cry
Oh, all the time
I'm grateful all the time (Grateful all the fucking time)
I'm sexy, and I'm kind
I'm pretty when I cry

"bad idea right"

Hey

Haven't heard from you in a couple of months
But I'm out right now and I'm all fucked up
And you're callin' my phone and you're all alone
And I'm sensing some undertone
And I'm right here with all my friends
But you're sending me your new address
And I know we're done, I know we're through
But, God, when I look at you

My brain goes, "Ah"
Can't hear my thoughts (I cannot hear my thoughts)
Like blah-blah-blah (Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah)
Should probably not
I should probably, probably not
I should probably, probably not

Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right
Seeing you tonight
Fuck it, it's fine

Yes, I know that he's my ex
But can't two people reconnect
I only see him as a friend
The biggest lie I ever said
Oh, yes, I know that he's my ex
But can't two people reconnect
I only see him as a friend
I just tripped and fell into his bed

Now I'm gettin' in the car, wreckin' all my plans
I know I should stop, but I can't
And I told my friends I was asleep
But I never said where or in whose sheets
And I pull up to your place on the second floor
And you're standing, smiling at the door
And I'm sure I've seen much hotter men
But I really can't remember when

My brain goes, "Ah"
Can't hear my thoughts (I cannot hear my thoughts)
Like blah-blah-blah (Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah)
Should probably not
I should probably, probably not
I should probably, probably not

Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right
Seeing you tonight
It's a bad idea, right
Seeing you tonight
Fuck it, it's fine

Yes, I know that he's my ex
But can't two people reconnect
I only see him as a friend
The biggest lie I ever said
Oh, yes, I know that he's my ex
But can't two people reconnect
I only see him as a friend
I just tripped and fell into his bed

Oh, yes, I know that he's my ex
Can't two people reconnect
The biggest lie I ever said
I just tripped and fell into his bed
My brain goes, "Ah"
Can't hear my thoughts
The biggest lie I ever said
My brain goes, "Ah"
Can't hear my thoughts
I just tripped and fell into his bed

Thoughts
Blah
Thoughts
Blah

"vampire"

Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it

I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity

'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so nave
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, famefucker
Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire

Every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy God I hate the way I called them crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching (How do you lie, how do you lie, how do you lie)

Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her
'Cause girls your age know better

I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so nave
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, famefucker
Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire

You said it was true love
But wouldn't that be hard
You can't love anyone
'Cause that would mean you had a heart
I tried to help you out
Now I know that I can't
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing
I'll never understand

I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so nave
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, famefucker
Bleeding me dry like a goddamn vampire

"lacy"

Lacy, oh, Lacy, skin like puff pastry
Aren't you the sweetest thing on this side of Hell
Dear angel Lacy, eyes white as daisies
Did I ever tell you that I'm not doin' well

Ooh, I care, I care, I care
Like perfume that you wear, I linger all the time
Watching, hidden in plain sight
Ooh, I try, I try, I try
But it takes over my life, I see you everywhere
The sweetest torture one could bear

Smart, sexy Lacy, I'm losin' it lately
I feel your compliments like bullets on skin
Dazzling starlet, Bardot reincarnate
Well, aren't you the greatest thing to ever exist

Ooh, I care, I care, I care
Like ribbons in your hair, my stomach's all in knots
You got the one thing that I want
Ooh, I try, I try, I try
Try to rationalize, people are people, but
It's like you're made of angel dust

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

Lacy, oh, Lacy, it's like you're out to get me
You poison every little thing that I do
Lacy, oh, Lacy, I just loathe you lately
And I despise my jealous eyes and how hard they fell for you
Yeah, I despise my rotten mind and how much it worships you

"ballad of a homeschooled girl"

Cat got my tongue
And I don't think I get along with anyone
Blood running cold
I'm on the outside of the greatest inside joke
And I hate all my clothes
Feels like my skin doesn't fit right over my bones
So I guess I should go
The party's done, and I'm no fun, I know, I know
I know, I know

I broke a glass, I tripped and fell
I told secrets I shouldn't tell
I stumbled over all my words
I made it weird, I made it worse
Each time I step outside
It's social suicide
It's social suicide
Wanna curl up and die
It's social suicide

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah

I laughed at the wrong time, sat with the wrong guy (Uh-huh)
Searchin' "how to start a conversation" on a website (How to flirt)
I talked to this hot guy, swore I was his type
Guess that he was makin' out with boys, like the whole night (Oh)
Everythin' I do is tragic (Oh)
Every guy I like is gay (Oh)
The morning after I panic (Oh)
Oh God, what did I say (Oh, oh, oh)

I broke a glass, I tripped and fell
I told secrets I shouldn't tell
I stumbled over all my words
I made it weird, I made it worse
Each time I step outside
It's social suicide
It's social suicide
Wanna curl up and die
It's social suicide
Yeah, when I'm alone, I'm fine
But don't let me out at night
It's social suicide
It's social suicide

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah

I broke a glass, tripped and fell
Told secrets I shouldn't tell
Stumbled over all my words
Made it weird, then made it worse
Each day that I'm alive
It's social suicide
It's social suicide
Wanna curl up and die
It's social suicide
It's social suicide
Don't let me out at night
I'm shocked I'm still alive
It's social suicide

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah

Thought your mom was your wife (Ah)
Called you the wrong name twice (Ah)
Can't think of a third line (Ah)
La-la-la-la-la-la (Ah)
La-la-la-la-la-la (Ah)
La-la-la-la-la-la (Ah)
La-la-la-la-la-la, ugh

"making the bed"

Want it, so I got it, did it, so it's done
Another thing I ruined, I used to do for fun
Another piece of plastic I could just throw away
Another conversation with nothing good to say
I thought it, so I said it, took it 'cause I can
Another day pretendin' I'm older than I am
Another perfect moment that doesn't feel like mine
Another thing I forced to be a sign

Well, sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
Gettin' drunk at a club with my fair-weather friends
Push away all the people who know me the best
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
I'm so tired of bein' the girl that I am
Every good thing has turned into somethin' I dread
And I'm playin' the victim so well in my head
But it's me who's been makin' the bed

Me who's been makin' the bed
Pull the sheets over my head, yeah
Makin' the bed

And every night, I wake up from this one recurrin' dream
Where I'm drivin' through the city, and the brakes go out on me
I can't stop at the red light, can't swerve off the road
I read somewhere it's 'cause my life feels so out of control
And I tell someone I love them just as a distraction
They tell me that they love me like I'm some tourist attraction
They're changin' my machinery, and I just let it happen
I got the things I wanted, it's just not what I imagined

Well, sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
Gettin' drunk at a club with my fair-weather friends
Push away all the people who know me the best
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
I'm so tired of bein' the girl that I am
Every good thing has turned into somethin' I dread
And I'm playin' the victim so well in my head
But it's me who's been makin' the bed

Me who's been makin' the bed
Pull the sheets over my head, yeah
Makin' the bed

Sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
Countin' all of the beautiful things I regret
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
Me who's been makin' the bed
Pull the sheets over my head
Makin' the bed, oh-oh

"logical"

Master manipulator
God, you're so good at what you do
Come for me like a savior
And I'd put myself through hell for you
Hear all the rumors lately
That you always denied

And I fell for you like water
Falls from the February sky
But now the current's stronger
And I couldn't get out if I tried
But you convinced me, baby
It was all in my mind
And now you got me thinking

Two plus two equals five
And I'm the love of your life
'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
Then changin' you is possible
No, love is never logical

You built a giant castle
With walls so high, I couldn't see
The way it all unraveled
And all the things you did to me
You lied, you lied, you lied
Oh
And now you got me thinkin'

Two plus two equals five
And I'm the love of your life
'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
Then changin' you is possible
I guess love is never logical

The sky is green, the grass is red
And you mean all those words you said
I'm sure that girl is really your friend
Our problems are all solvable
'Cause lovin' you is lovin' every

Argument you held over my head
Brought up the girls you could have instead
Said I was too young, I was too soft
Can't take a joke, can't get you off
Oh, why do I do this
I look so stupid thinkin'

Two plus two equals five
And I'm the love of your life
'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
Then changin' you is possible
No, love is never logical

Logical, logical, love is never logical
I know I'm half responsible and that makes me feel horrible

Oh, logical, logical, love is never logical
I know I could've stopped it all, God, why didn't I stop it all

Oh, logical, logical, love is never logical
I know I'm half responsible and that makes me feel horrible

Oh, logical, logical, love is never logical
I know I could've stopped it all, God, why didn't I stop it all

"get him back"

One, two, three
Wait, is this the song with the drums

I met a guy in the summer and I left him in the spring
He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye
He said he's six-foot-two and I'm like, "Dude, nice try"
But he was so much fun and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties and the night would never end
Another song, another club, another bar, another dance
And when he said something wrong, he'd just fly me to France
So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed
'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend
Do I love him Do I hate him I guess it's up and down
If I had to choose, I would say right now

I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge
And I want him again
I want to get him back, back, back

So I write him all these letters, then I throw them in the trash
'Cause I miss the way he kisses and the way he made me laugh
Yeah, I pour my little heart out, but as I'm hitting "send"
I picture all the faces of my disappointed friends
Because everyone knew all of the shit that he'd do
He said I was the only girl, but that just wasn't the truth
And when I told him how he hurt me, he'd tell me I was trippin'
But I am my father's daughter, so maybe I could fix him

I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge
And I want him again
I want to get him back (And then And then)
I want to get him back, back, back

I wanna key his car (I want to get him back)
I wanna make him lunch (But then I, I want to get him back)
I wanna break his heart (But then I, I want to get him back)
Then be the one to stitch it up (But then I, I want to get him back)
Wanna kiss his face (But then I, I want to get him back)
With an uppercut (But then I, I want to get him back)
I wanna meet his mom (But then I, I want to get him back)
Just to tell her her son sucks (But then I, I want to get him back)
Oh, I wanna key his car, I wanna make him lunch (But then I, I want to get him back, I want to)
I wanna break his heart, stitch it right back up (But then I, I want to get him back, get him back)
I wanna kiss his face with an uppercut (But then I, I want to get him back, I want to)
I wanna meet his mom and tell her her son sucks, yeah (But then I, I want to get him back, get him back)

I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge
And I want him again
I want to get him back (And then And then)
I want to get him back (Back, back)

I'll get him, I'll get him, I'll get him, I'll get him back (Woo-hoo)
Get him back (Come on, come on, woo)
I'm gonna get him so good, he's not even gonna know what hit him
He's gonna love me and hate me at the same time
(Get him back, girl, you better get him back)
(You got it, got it)
Oh, I don't know, I got him good, I got him really good

"love is embarrassing"

I told my friends you were the one
After I'd known you like a month
And then you kissed some girl from high school
And I stayed in bed for like a week
When you said space was what you need
Waited by my phone like a goddamn fool

And now it don't mean a thing
God, love's fucking embarrassing
Just watch as I crucify myself
For some weird second string
Loser who's not worth mentionin'
My God, love's embarrassing as hell

And I consoled you while you cried
Over your ex-girlfriend's new guy
My God, how could I be so stupid
You found a new version of me
And I damn near started World War III
Jesus, what was I even doing

'Cause now it don't mean a thing
God, love's fucking embarrassing
Just watch as I crucify myself
For some weird second string
Loser who's not worth mentionin'
My God, love's embarrassing as hell

I give up, give up
I give up everything
I placed my bets and
It's not worth anything
I give up, give up
But I keep comin' back for more

Yeah, it don't mean a thing
God, love's fucking embarrassing
Just watch as I crucify myself
For some weird second string
Loser who's not worth mentionin'
My God, love's embarrassing as hell

Yeah, yeah, I give up, give up
I give up everything
I'm plannin' out my wedding
With some guy I'm never marryin'
I'm givin' up, I'm givin' up
But I keep comin' back for more

"the grudge"

I have nightmares each week about that Friday in May
One phone call from you and my entire world was changed
Trust that you betrayed, confusion that still lingers
You took everything I loved and crushed it in between your fingers
And I doubt you ever think about the damage that you did
But I hold on to every detail like my life depends on it
My undying love, now I hold it like a grudge
And I hear your voice every time that I think I'm not enough

And I try to be tough, but I wanna scream
How could anybody do the things you did so easily
And I say I don't care, I say that I'm fine
But you know I can't let it go
I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long
It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong

The arguments that I have won against you in my head
In the shower, in the car and in the mirror before bed
Yeah, I'm so tough when I'm alone and I make you feel so guilty
And I fantasize about a time you're a little fucking sorry
And I try to understand why you would do this all to me
You must be insecure, you must be so unhappy
And I know in my heart hurt people hurt people
And we both drew blood, but, man, those cuts were never equal

And I try to be tough, but I wanna scream
How could anybody do the things you did so easily
And I say I don't care, I say that I'm fine
But you know I can't let it go
I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long
It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong

Ooh, do you think I deserved it all
Ooh, your flower's filled with vitriol
You built me up to watch me fall
You have everything and you still want more

I try to be tough, I try to be mean
But even after all this, you're still everything to me
And I know you don't care, I guess that that's fine
But you know I can't let it go
I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long
It takes strength to forgive, but I'm not quite sure I'm there yet
It takes strength to forgive, but

"pretty isn't pretty"

Bought a bunch of makeup
Tryna' cover up my face
I started to skip lunch
Stopped eatin' cake on birthdays
Bought a new prescription
To try and stay calm
'Cause there's always something missin'
There's always something in the mirror that I think looks wrong

When pretty isn't pretty enough
What do you do
And everybody's keepin' it up
So you think it's you
I could change up my body and change up my face
I could try every lipstick in every shade
But I'd always feel the same
'Cause pretty isn't pretty enough anyways

You can win the battle
But you'll never win the war
Fix the things you hated
And you'd still feel so insecure

And I try to ignore it, but it's everything I see
It's on the posters on the wall, it's in the shitty magazines
It's in my phone, it's in my head, it's in the boys I bring to bed
It's all around, it's all the time and I don't know why I even try

When pretty isn't pretty enough
What do you do
And everybody's keepin' it up
So you think it's you
I could change up my body and change up my face
I could try every lipstick in every shade
But I'd always feel the same
'Cause pretty isn't pretty enough

And I bought all the clothes that they told me to buy
I chased some dumb ideal my whole fucking life
And none of it matters and none of it ends
You just feel like shit over and over again

No, it'll never change
Pretty isn't pretty enough
Everybody's keepin' it up
Pretty isn't pretty enough
Pretty isn't

"teenage dream"

When am I gonna stop being wise beyond my years and just start being wise
When am I gonna stop being a pretty young thing to guys
When am I gonna stop being great for my age and just start being good
When will it stop being cool to be quietly misunderstood

I'll blow out the candles, happy birthday to me
Got your whole life ahead of you, you're only nineteen
But I fear that they already got all the best parts of me
And I'm sorry that I couldn't always be your teenage dream

And when does wide-eyed affection and all good intentions start to not be enough
When will everyone have every reason to call all my bluffs
And when are all my excuses of learning my lessons gonna start to feel sad
Will I spend all the rest of my years wishing I could go back

I'll blow out the candles, happy birthday to me
Got your whole life ahead of you, you're only nineteen
But I fear that they already got all the best parts of me
And I'm sorry that I couldn't always be your teenage dream

They all say that it gets better
It gets better the more you grow
Yeah, they all say that it gets better
It gets better, but what if I don't
Oh, they all say that it gets better
It gets better the more you grow
Yeah, they all say that it gets better
It gets better, but what if I don't
Oh, they all say that it gets better
It gets better the more you grow
Yeah, they all say that it gets better
It gets better, but what if I don't
Oh, they all say that it gets better
It gets better the more you grow
Yeah, they all say that it gets better
It gets better, but what if I don't

Is this recording
Of course it is

"obsessed"

La-da-da-da, da-da-da (Da-da-da-da-da)
La-da-da-da-da

If I told you how much I think about her
You'd think I was in love
And if you knew how much I looked at her pictures
You would think we're best friends

'Cause I know her star sign, I know her blood type
I've seen every movie she's been in and, oh God, she's beautiful
And I know you love her and I know about her
But I can't help it, no, I can't help it

I'm so obsessed with your ex (Uh-huh)
I know she's been asleep on my side of your bed and I can feel it
I'm starin' at her like I wanna get hurt
And I remember every detail you would ever tell me, so be careful, baby
I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)
Yeah, I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)

La-da-da-da, da-da-da

She's got those lips, she's got those hips
The life of every fuckin' party
She's talented, she's good with kids
She even speaks kindly about me, ah-ah

And I know you love me and I know it's crazy
But every time you call my name, I think you mistake me for her
You both have moved on, you don't even talk
But I can't help it, I got issues, I can't help it, baby

I'm so obsessed with your ex
I know she's been asleep on my side in your bed and I can feel her
I'm starin' at her like I wanna get hurt
And I remember every detail you would ever tell me, so be careful, baby
I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)
Yeah, I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)

Is she friends with your friends Is she good in bed
Do you think about her No I'm fine, it doesn't matter, tell me
Is she easy-goin' Never controllin'
Well-traveled Well-read Oh God, she's makin' me so obsessed

I'm so obsessed with your ex (Ah)
She's been asleep on my side in your bed (Ah), woah
I'm so obsessed with your ex (Why'd she make me so obsessed Ah)
I'm so obsessed with your, with your ex

"scared of my guitar"

Perfect, easy, so good to me
So why's there a pit in my gut in the shape of you
Distract myself, say it's somethin' else
Maybe I'm just overwhelmed, maybe I'm confused

Barely sleep when you sleep next to me
But I keep thinkin' I'll find a cure
I say that I'm fine, I tell you all the time
I've never felt so happy and sure

But I'm so scared of my guitar
'Cause it cuts right through to the heart
Yeah, it knows me too well so I got no excuse
I can't lie to it the same way that I lie to you
I'm so scared of my guitar
If I play it, then I'll think too hard
Once you let the thought in, then it's already done
So I lay in your arms and pretend that it's love

I was ravin', no boy like you
I had the nerve to just stop stringin' you all along
But I'm not half as decent as you
I'd rather be tied to someone, even if they're wrong

I make excuses, my friends know the truth is
I'm not as alright as I claim
I say that I'm fine, I tell them all the time
As they watch all the life fade away

Yeah, I'm so scared of my guitar
'Cause it cuts right through to the heart
Yeah, it knows me too well so I got no excuse
I can't lie to it the same way that I lie to you
I'm so scared of my guitar
If I play it, then I'll think too hard
Once you let the thought in and then it's already done
So I lay in your arms and pretend that it's love
Yeah, I lay in your arms and pretend that it's love

I pretend that it's love
I pretend that it's love
I pretend that it's love, love

'Cause what if I never find anything better
The doubt always creeps through my mind
So we'll stay together 'cause how could I ever
Trade somethin' that's good for what's right

Oh, I'm so scared of my guitar
It cuts right through my heart
It knows me too well, I got no excuse
I can't lie to it the same way that I lie to you
I'm so scared of my guitar
When I play it is when I think too hard
I let the thought in, it's already done
But I lay in your arms and pretend that it's love
Yeah, I lay in your arms and pretend it's enough

"stranger"

I woke up this mornin' and I sat up straight in bed
I had the strangest feeling of this weight off in my chest
I hadn't felt that hopeful since the day that you left and it felt nice
So nice
And everybody told me it would happen in time
The fire would burn out and all the storm clouds would subside
And I always believed that it was some comforting lie that they believe it's nice
So nice

'Cause I was half myself without you and now I feel so complete
And I can't even remember what made me lose all my sleep
I cried a million rivers for you, but that's over now
You're just a stranger I know everything about, ooh, ooh
You're just a stranger I know everything about

Made a pot of coffee and I poured myself a cup
I thought of all the things I did to try and win your love
How did that happen I can't imagine ever doin' all that stuff for just one guy
Like, you're just some guy
Oh, but I hope that you're happy, babe, you know I really do
And God knows that I am the girl I am because of you
You know I'll always think of you, I'll love you 'til the end of time
You are the best thing that I'll ever keep so far out of my life

Yeah, I was half myself without you and now I feel so complete
I can't even remember what made me lose all my sleep
I cried a million rivers for you, but that's over now
You're just a stranger I know everything about, ooh, ooh
You're just a stranger I know everything about

There's nothin' left for me to know
I had to stay, you had to go
And it was me, but it doesn't matter anymore, no
There's nothin' left for me to sing
I screamed, I cried, I did the whole thing
And I loved you mad, but it doesn't matter anymore, no

I was half myself without you, but now I feel so complete
And if I'm not enough for you, you're not enough for me
I fought a million battles, but you can't get to me now
You're just a stranger I know everything about, ooh, ooh
You're just a stranger I know everything about
You're just a stranger I know everything about

"girl i've always been"

Five, six, five, six, seven, eight

"Baby doll, you have changed"
That's the thing you always say
Cursin' me, trash my name
I rained all over your parade
Now you're on my couch, you're fightin' tears
You say I'm cruel beyond my years
And as I'm walkin' out that door
Say you don't know me anymore

I have captors I call friends
I got panic rooms inside my head
I get down with crooked men
But I am the girl I've always been
I got a wrapped up in the game again
You woke up in an empty bed
And I can't say I'm a perfect ten
But I am the girl I've always been

Ah, mmm

So don't say that I've been acting different
I'm nothin' if I'm not consistent
You knew everything you'd be gettin'
I told you right from the beginnin'
Now you're on my case, how could I go
You never dreamed I'd be so cold
And then, with venom on your tongue
You ask who I have become

Well, I have captors I call friends
I got panic rooms inside my head
And I get down with the crooked men
But I am the girl I've always been
I got a wrapped up in the game again
You woke up in an empty bed
And I can't say I'm a perfect ten
But I am the girl I've always been

Yeah, I'm a candle in the wind
I'll turn you out, I'll turn you in
But I am the girl I've always been

"21st Century Girls"
(unreleased)

Long, blonde hair
Daddy's a millionaire
Nobody knows her
I mean everybody wants to
That's what I see

Europe trips
Kissing the dream boy's lips
Successful with a smile
She's everything I'll never be

21st century girls are perfect
And I know it isn't real, it sounds so stupid
But digital love, it still feels real to me
She looks like an angel, that's what they'll believe

21st century girls are flawless
And I say I didn't care, but if I am honest
It's hard not to feel like I'm never enough
Yeah, I want that 21st century love

"Apocalyptic Crush"
(unreleased)

Yeah, you must think you're funny calling him at ten o'clock
You think he thinks you're pretty, I can guarantee he does not
I know you see me, do you think that you can win this game

Yeah, you must think that you're so attractive when you're playing dumb
The only thing you're showing him is how desperate you've become
I hope you trip over the boundaries that you've stepped right over

But go ahead and shoot your shot, baby
Let me know how it goes
Know him better than you thought and I think you should know

You're his apocalyptic crush
He'd like you only if there was
No one left on earth
Babe, I'm sorry if that hurts
But he's mine until then

You're his apocalyptic crush
If we all died you'd be the one
Who'd get to kiss him in the ashes
So, hey, what are the chances of World War III
'Cause he's never gonna like you like he likes me

"Astronaut"

Ah (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Ah (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Ah (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Ah-ah (Ah, ah)

They say she's pretty
She comes from money
She gives you everything I couldn't give
You take her to the beach
You talk rationally
That's the kind of life I could never live

'Cause I'm an astronaut (Ah, ah)
I'm tethered to the stars (Ah, ah)
Yeah, I'm an astronaut (Ah, ah)
Who still thinks the world could be ours (Ah, ah)

When I sit here and watch you and her from outer space
I watch every part of me be replaced
And slowly, but surely
I drift away

They say you sing to her (Ah-ah)
She understands your humor (Ah-ah)
I'm glad you found yourself someone you can tie down (Ah, ah)
Oh-oh, let me ask you something small (Ah-ah)
Are you recycling it all (Ah-ah)
All of the sweet little words
And the perfect slow burns
I wonder if you told her I did that shit first (Ah)

Mmm, but I'm an astronaut (Ah)
Could never keep my feet on the ground (Ah, ah)
Yeah, I'm an astronaut (Ah, ah)
My dreams were too big to make you proud (Ah, ah)

So I sit here and watch you and her from outer space
I watch every part of me be replaced
And slowly, but surely
I drift away

You couldn't handle my lunacy, my voice, my opportunity
The distance and my confidence, no you couldn't put up with it
You left me stranded in the stars and ran into another's arms
Will you see me on the T.V. and be proud
Until then, just please do not forget about

Your little astronaut
Who's tethered to the stars
Your little astronaut
Who still thinks the world could be ours

Who's sittin' and watchin' you and her from outer space
I watch every part of me be replaced
And slowly, but surely, I'll
I'll be okay

Mmm, mmm (Ah, ah)
I'll be okay

"baby is you"
(unreleased)

I know you're with somebody new
But I can't write a song that's not all about you
It's not fair, baby
How come it's so easy
For you to forget everything you said
Like how I was the best girl that you'd ever met
Guess you take it back
Should've expected that

When I say I'm fine, I'm lyin' really well
'Cause I can't love anyone else
And I'm so jealous that you can
Scared I'll never feel that again
'Cause I still can't call anyone "Baby"
'Cause "Baby" is still you to me
Don't you think I wanna move on, too
But I can't love anyone the way, the way I loved you

"Can't Catch Me Now"
(from "The Hunger Games The Ballad Of Songbirds & Snakes" soundtrack)

There's blood on the side of the mountain
There's writing all over the wall
Shadows of us are still dancin'
In every room and every hall
There's snow fallin' over the city
You thought that it would wash away
The bitter taste of my fury
And all of the messes you made
Yeah, you think that you got away

But I'm in the trees, I'm in the breeze
My footsteps on the ground
You'll see my face in every place
But you can't catch me now
Through wading grass, the months will pass
You'll feel it all around
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere
But you can't catch me now
No, you can't catch me now

Bet you thought I'd never do it
Thought it'd go over my head
I bet you figured I'd pass with the winter
Be somethin' easy to forget
Oh, you think I'm gone 'cause I left

But I'm in the trees, I'm in the breeze
My footsteps on the ground
You'll see my face in every place
But you can't catch me now
Through wading grass, the months will pass
You'll feel it all around
I'm here, I'm there, I'm everywhere
But you can't catch me now
No, you can't catch me now

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

You can't, you can't catch me now
I'm comin' like a storm into your town
You can't, you can't catch me now
I'm higher than the hopes that you brought down
You can't, you can't catch me now
I'm comin' like a storm into your town
You can't, you can't catch me now
I'm higher than the hopes that you brought down
You can't, you can't catch me now
I'm comin' like a storm into your town
You can't, you can't catch me now
You can't, you can't, you can't

There's blood on the side of the mountain
It's turning a new shade of red
Yeah, sometimes the fire you founded
Don't burn the way you'd expect
Yeah, you thought that this was the end

"Creature Of Habit"
(unreleased)

Planned out the conversation that we'll have when you see me
For the first time after these months of apathy
And you'll say that you want me back
And I'll say, "Babe, you don't mean that," ah-ah

'Cause I psychoanalyzed you better than your therapist
And I know that you don't love me
I know you just hate the risk of meeting someone else
Having to introduce yourself, ah-ah

You're not a hopeless romantic
You're just a creature of habit
You want me 'cause I'm easy
You want me 'cause you know me
I'm not your soulmate, babe, I swear
No, I'm just there, ah-ah, ah-ah
Oh, I'm just there, ooh-ooh

"Gross"
(unreleased)

Not long ago when I saw you there
With your brown eyed grin and your messy hair
And every girl at the party was looking at you (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I wonder what I'd say if I knew back then
That the brown eyed boy'd be my best friend
And the one I'd give my heart to (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Now everything reminds me of you
Your pictures framed all over my room
And if I hate someone, you'll hate 'em too

As long as I'm your darling angel
I don't need anything in the world
'Cause I feel like the luckiest every second that I'm your girl
I wanna do everything with you
Take the highs, I'll take the lows
I'll keep you close
Give you the most, oh, baby
I like you so much, it's kinda gross
Yeah, I like you so much, it's kinda gross

And driving in your car, I feel all grown up
Is it me or does it feel more than high school love
Not gonna lie, your last name sounds so ni-i-i-ce
I love when you complain about things like traffic
Love when you're tired, baby, I like all of it
Honestly, I can't believe you're mi-i-i-ine

I bring you up in every conversation
We're young, I know we gotta be patient
But I know I want my life to have you in it

Ooh, and as long as I'm your darling angel
I don't need anything in the world
'Cause I feel like the luckiest every second that I'm your girl
I wanna do everything with you
Take the highs, I'll take the lows
I'll keep you close
Give you the most, oh, baby
I like you so much, it's kinda gross
Yeah, I like you so much, it's kinda gross

"Just Because"
(unreleased)

I like the way you talk when you've just woken up
And I like the way we can joke about offensive stuff
I like the way you give homeless men your mittens
When you're all out of spare change
And I like the way you think, I like your reasoning
Everyone thinks you're brilliant, you think you don't know anything
I like the way you care, you're nice when no one's there
God, I hope you never change

'Cause people love to talk
And people always want something from you
'Cause that's what people do
But I don't want a thing
I think you're astounding
And I don't care what anyone says or what anyone does
'Cause, boy, I like you
And I like you just because

"L-O-V-E"
(unreleased)

A Monday morning you meet me at the hotel, and
You bought me coffee just to spill it on yourself
But you never take things seriously
It's kinda why I like you so much, honestly

And I wrote a note and left it folded in your pocket
You taped it to your wall in your New York apartment
Kissing in the taxi cab
'Til the driver gives us dirty looks back

Oh, it's L-O-V-E, or something like that
You're crazy, but it's not in a bad way
Dancing on the highway
You make me feel older than seventeen

Yeah, this is L-O-V-E, or something really close
Hey, baby, I think you're really dope
I honestly don't know why
I should ever leave your side
'Cause this is love, right

"Never Be Like Her"
(unreleased)

Blonde hair falls just above her shoulders
She's nineteen, but she looks a little older
With the prom queen smile, the cool vintage style
You're obsessed with her, and I don't blame you for it

But I'll never look like her
Not even if I tried
I'll never be cooler
Not even if I lied
Oh, she's whole where I am broken
She's great where I am good
And I'll never be like her
But you know I wish I could

"Pay Grade"
(unreleased)

You call me every night and tell me that you feel like shit
I say, "I'm sorry, is there any way I can help with it"
I listen to you scream, the world is simply your enemy
"With death and taxes, what's the point of tryna be happy"

And I've had bad days, bad years
Bad boys and bad careers
But I'm still standin' here
I understand you, darlin', but at the end of the day
You just won't help yourself
Rather give someone else
A glimpse into your hell
Pour all your problems on 'em just so you can walk away

Boy, I'm too young to be your mother
Not smart enough to be your therapist either
And I'm always here if you need a talk
But maybe first, you should take a walk
'Cause I'm not gonna make you change
That's above my pay grade, babe

"Pretender"
(unreleased)

What lies behind
Your pretty house with the white picket fence
And all the Barbies that you call your friends

Is your life a lie
Nothing's as good as it seems
And you're not the girl of their dreams

Oh, and maybe your life is all flowers
Maybe I'm insecure
Maybe you're good at taking pictures
Maybe you're a pretender, oh

Pretender, I'm pointing my finger at you
Pretender, if only they knew what I knew
Yeah, if only they knew what I knew

I'm happy with me
Think that's supposed to be enough
So why am I sulking, calling your bluff

Maybe your life is all flowers
Maybe I'm insecure
And maybe you're good at taking pictures
You're a pretender

Pretender, I'm pointing my finger at you
Pretender, if only they knew what I knew
Yeah, if only they knew what I knew

Pretender, I guess you're really not so bad
Maybe you pretend
But you look like you got the life I wish I had
I created you
To be plastic and deadly
I created you
To hide my own envy
To hide my own envy, yeah

Pretender, I wish I knew what you knew
Pretender, if only I was like you
Maybe I'm a pretender like you

"Prison For Life"

Just a boy in a Chevy truck
He's got money, but not too much
And he calls me, "Baby girl"
I run my hands through his curls
And my parents think he's good
And he is, but rest assured
He's anything but sweet
If someone comes for me

I'm a feminist obviously (Oh)
But I wouldn't really mind him saving me (Ah)
And I know that I'm fine without a man (Ah)
But I think I would like his protection (Ah)
I'm just being honest, can't change what I like
I'll never forget it, he told me one night
"If anybody hurts you, ha
I'm going to prison for life"

I'm no damsel in distress, no
But I like assertiveness, so
Wrap your arm around me, babe
And tell me that you'll keep me safe
I know it's bad to fantasize
About robbers and bad guys
But if you were there to save the day, ha
Think I'll let them in a merry way

I'm a feminist obviously (Oh)
But I wouldn't really mind him saving me (Ah)
And I know that I'm fine without a man (Ah)
But I think I would like his protection (Ah)
I'm just being honest, can't change what I like
I'll never forget it, he told me one night
"If anybody hurts you, ha
I'm going to prison for life"

(I) I know I can protect myself
(I) But when you do it for me, it's hot as hell
(I) You got my heart, you know me too well
(I) Think I'd even send you love letters in jail
(I)

I'm a feminist obviously (Oh)
But I wouldn't really mind him saving me (Saving me)
And I know that I'm fine without a man (A man)
But I think I would like his protection (Protection)
And God knows that I don't need no one
But pretending that I do is kind of fun (Kind of fun)
Yeah, I know that I'm fine without a man
But I think I'd like his protection (I'd like his protection)
I'm just being honest, can't change what I like
I'll never forget it, he told me one night (Night)

"Rebel Without A Clue"
(unreleased)

Sitting in my room
What's it all about
Feels like the world is gonna end
Before I figure her out

Drink up, my friend
My potion of emotion
Can you feel the love, the hate, the jealousy
The sheer confusion

'Cause I don't really know who I am
Or how to present that to you
I don't really know just who I am
I'm a rebel without a clue, oh

Let's sit, watch the trains all derail
They want me to learn
Well, they can sit and watch me fail
Are my friends changin'
Or is it in my mind
Will I ever shake hands with time

'Cause I don't really know who I am
Or how to present that to you
I don't really know just who I am
I'm a rebel without a clue, oh, no

I don't really know who I am
And now you want me to change
I don't really know what I am
Isn't everything just so strange

Sitting in my room
What's it all about Oh

"Strange"
(unreleased)

Oh no
Your voice through the phone
Tells me way more, than I ever wanted to know
You say, that you need your space
That letting me go
Was the hardest thing you could do cause
You're crazy for me, and I'm the best that you ever had

Oh no
It's kinda funny

Said it was raining but the suns out
Said you loved me, you're with her now
And I don't need you to explain
I'm just saying that it's strange
Said you couldn't live without me
Heard you're dancing at a party
And I don't wanna take her place
I'm just saying that it's strange

Strange, strange, strange
Strange, strange, strange

Oh no
I saw you and her
Out on the street
You were never that public with me
I know
That you met her when you were with me
I said I had doubts and you said I was crazy
Baby, was I crazy after all
Oh, oh, it's really funny

Said it was raining but the suns out
Said you loved me, you're with her now
And I don't need you to explain
I'm just saying that it's strange
Said you couldn't live without me
Heard you're dancing at a party
And I don't wanna take her place
I'm just saying that it's strange

Strange, strange, strange
Strange, strange, strange
I'm just saying that it's strange
Strange, strange, strange
Strange, strange, strange

Oh no, I guess I was right
Wish I was wrong
Me and my heart will be fine

Said it was raining but the suns out
Said you loved me, you're with her now
And I don't need you to explain
I'm just saying that it's strange
Said you couldn't live without me
Heard you're dancing at a party
And I don't wanna take her place
I'm just saying that it's strange

Strange, strange, strange
Strange, strange, strange
I'm just saying that it's strange
Strange, strange, strange
Strange, strange, strange

"The Ones I Love"

Sit in your car, wait in the dark
Radio is up and so is your guard
You don't know what to say
You're faking a smile, you say that you're fine
And maybe it'll all work out in time
You've always been good that way

Feel like I've done this before
You're fighting your tears as I open the door
And you deserve much more

Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
And I watch you cry, 'cause I wasn't enough
Watch you disappearing down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most

You told me your past
You hated your dad
And when you left college, couldn't wait to go back
'Cause you really trusted me
And what did I do What did I do
I built you up, abandoned you
And I'm too proud to say sorry

Feel like I've done this before
You're fighting your tears as I open the door
And you deserve much more

Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
And I watch you cry, 'cause I wasn't enough
Watch you disappearing down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most

I didn't mean it, baby
I didn't think it all through
I didn't mean it, baby
Always ruin good things like you
I watched the life drain out of your eyes
And it's no surprise
It's no surprise

Seems like I always hurt the ones I love
Now I watch you cry, 'cause I wasn't enough
I watch you disappearing down the road
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love the most
Seems like I always hurt the ones I love

Ones I love the most

"Victim"
(unreleased)

I've been bad to boys I love
Maybe I'm selfish, maybe I'm young
And my guilty Catholic heart tears my guilty self apart on the floor
But I wish that you did something bad so we could settle the score

Let me be the victim of your perfect crime
Bathe in my blood so I'm not the bad guy
I messed up so maybe mess up too
Really want the blame to be on you
So, drive the knife in deep
Make the victim me

Then I'll hear the yells and see the red and blue
It'll be in the headlines, all our friends will hate you
I know I didn't deserve you, but now, it's vice versa
You'll finally see how it tastes
'Cause hurting the one that you swore you'd protect is the worst kind of heartbreak

So, let me be the victim of your perfect crime
I'll kill your conscience like you killed mine
Yeah, I messed up so maybe mess up, too
Really want the blame to be on you
So, drive the knife in deep
And make the victim me
Me, oh...

"White Flowers"
(unreleased)

White flowers and love letters
You say I'm yours forever
But it don't feel romantic, somehow

I'm pacing and I'm losing sleep
If you don't call, I start to weep
You're everything I cannot do without

I don't know who I would be
If I wasn't your baby
I built my life on your attention
On being an object of your affection

Now, crazy in love don't feel sweet
'Cause I'm with you but I miss me
Wish somebody had told me what I know now
Losing yourself in someone isn't Heaven, it's Hell

"Hearing Your Voice"

Met a shaman, he was crazy
Called me stupid, stole my money
Told him 'bout what we've been facing
I've been jealous, often dating
Know you stole my fuckin' phone
Probably read something real crazy
Heard you changed your name in lovers
Wish that I could call you baby

But that's not fair
You got everything I need
Used to call me constantly
You cut your hair
Change it all except for me
Don't take back what's meant to be

It don't make sense to me
But I'm fantasizing 'bout hearing your voice
It don't make sense to me
But I'm fantasizing 'bout hearing your voice

Wish you lived a little closer
Clean your house, borrow some clothes
Maybe talk 'bout California
Heard it's not like Indiana
I got time, what you expected
Sleepless nights, felt disconnected
Smoke a lot, your dad don't care
He's on the porch catching some air

But that's not fair
You got everything I need
Used to call me constantly
You cut your hair
Change it all except for me
Don't take back what's meant to be

It don't make sense to me
But I'm fantasizing 'bout hearing your voice
It don't make sense to me
But I'm fantasizing 'bout hearing your voice

Don't close your eyes again
Cause you're not there
I'm not confiding in
What's really here

It don't make sense to me
But I'm fantasizing 'bout hearing your voice
It don't make sense to me
But I'm fantasizing 'bout hearing your voice

"Invincible"
(feat. Daniel Caesar)

If I were to go (Go, go)
Tell me, would you notice me
If I were to go (Go, go)
Tell me, would you notice me
(If I were to)

Twenty-four hours after CS01 release
I miss my girl, it's time to hit the streets
I went to check my doc, get some vitamin C
You won't believe what happened to me, I

Drip, drip, drip with the cold IV
Out of consciousness if I ever slip it
And I woke up in an ambulance

If I were to go (Go, go)
Tell me, would you notice me
If I were to go (Go, go)
Tell me, would you notice me
(If I were to)

Sixty-four hours since my baby spoke to me
He kissed me, now I love his dopamine
I tried to go to sleep but my brain on 2C-B
You won't believe what happened to me, I
Drip, drip, drip with the cold IV
Out of consciousness if I ever slip it
I been gone, moving high speed now
That's my song, let me hear that bounce
Latin boy, Frida Khalo brow
Jacquemus jeans, Ferragamo brown
Venetian walls with porcelain tile
286, Donnie Darko town
If I'm down, would you help me out
If I'm down, would you help me out

I had to call you back to tell you that (Call me back)
You could have spared my feelings (Could have spared my feelings)
I'm not invincible, I'm not invincible (I'm not invincible)
I had to call you back to tell you that (Call me back)
You could have spared my feelings (Could have spared)

I'm not invincible (I'm not invincible)

If I were to go tell me would you notice me
If I were to go tell me would you notice me
If I were to go tell me would you notice me

"Endlessly Interlude"

Yourself to me, baby (Baby)
Already got what I'll ever need (Ever need)
I know deep in me there's everything (Everything)
What if I trust myself endlessly (Endlessly)

Oh, la, la, la, la, la
Oh, la, la, la, la, la
Oh, la, la, la, la, la
Oh, la, la, la, la, la

"Killing Me"

You-ooh, ooh-ooh
You-ooh, ooh-ooh

Why, do I depend on you
Sixteen, about to pull up
Think 'bout your body too much
I'm, feelin' you for real
Missin' the party for what
There ain't nobody but us

Love me like I'm gonna die
Fuck me like you fantasize
Touch me like you know you provide to
They wanna lie too
Just wanna slide through, oh

What I do makes me wonder if I'm alright
Holding back feelings like it's the end of my life
That's right, shit killing me
That's right, shit killing me

Qu locura solo piense a ti
Cuando me tocas y me llamas, oh Lord
Adrenaline, gentleman right there
Skeletons that I don't hold back
Try to stop, do you feel relaxed
Love you but you make feel light-headed, oh, oh

Love me like I'm gonna die
Fuck me like you fantasize
Touch me like you know you provide to
They wanna lie too
Just wanna slide through, oh

What I do makes me wonder if I'm alright
Holding back feelings like it's the end of my life
That's right, shit killing me (That's, right, that's right, that's right, that's, right, that's right, that's right)
That's right, shit killing me (That's, right, that's right, that's right, that's, right, that's right, that's right)

That's, right, that's right, that's right
That's, right, that's right, that's right (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
That's, right, that's right, that's right (Ooh, ooh-woah)
That's, right, that's right, that's right (Oh, why I kissed you)

"Go Away"

You can take the throne
Body glows like gold
Beating hearts lie close
Without you, time moves slow

Do you think that I could stay
'Cause if I leave, then I complain
I know this feeling's not a crime
You said you feel it all the time

But if you had to go away again
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough
It's something in the way I feel your skin
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough

If you saw me every morning
Would you feel less important
Is that too much I'm forcing
'Cause I don't wanna be much
I love the way that we touch
Do you like all of my friends, and
I want your attention
Before you'd never mention
That you got time here to stay
Is that too much for your brain

But if you had to go away again
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough
It's something in the way I feel your skin
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough

But if you had to go away again
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough

But if you had to go away again
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough
It's something in the way I feel your skin
I just don't see you enough
I wish I saw you enough

"Waiting On You"

Handsome and tall, my baby
They think he gets all the ladies
If you were there then you would know
Don't even care nobody
Invites him to all the parties
If he cared then he would go

Pace 'round, sitting down wishing for a sign that
Don't come, I'll stay here as long as I'm alive
I'm waiting on you
I'm waiting on you

Buff and his skin looks gorgeous
How could someone ignore this
We took a trip down a new road
After his pupils widened
It got him realizing
That he wouldn't dream to be alone

Pace 'round, sitting down wishing for a sign that
Don't come, I'll stay here as long as I'm alive
I'm waiting on you
I'm waiting on you

Pace 'round, sitting down wishing for a sign that
Don't come, I'll stay here as long as I'm alive
I'm waiting on you
I'm waiting on you

"Petrified"

The bedspread was silk
But the marbles were stiff
He showed me my face
So I loosened my grip
A shadow came down
Told me I live, a lie

Thinking of you more each day
I'm thinking about all the words you say to me

A stranger convinced me to cancel my trip
He sang me a song but it didn't exist
He said an angel came down and gave him a melody

Thinking of you more each day
I'm thinking about all the words you say to me

I believe in making up
I believe in making up
I believe in what I fear
Lately I've been able to see more clear

Thinking of you more each day
I'm thinking bout all the words you say to me

"Personally"

'Cause I really don't wanna be here alone
Too many people I don't see no more
Too many feelings I don't feel no more
'Cause I really don't wanna be here alone
Too many people I don't need no more
So many doubts that I stop keeping score

Remember when you told me
That I ain't lonely you used to hold me
You always was the one to make up reasons quick
And I would be the one that would believe in it
Facetime me just to pass time
But I still rewind what you said last night
You said that you would always have some reasoning
How come you only did that on the weekend, then

Don't take this personally
I just can't be the person you need
What we got ain't working for me
And all it ever did was change the person in me

Don't take this personally
I just can't be the person you need
What we got ain't working for me
All it ever did was change the person in me

'Cause I really don't wanna be here alone
Too many people I don't see no more
Too many feelings I don't feel no more
'Cause I really don't wanna be here alone
Too many people I don't need no more
So many doubts that I stop keeping score

Can't sleep 'cause I been stressed out
My eyes they caved in, I scarred my eyebrow
Too much that's on my mind, I gotta deal with shit
It'll slow me down if I don't come to peace with it
Relax, you told me relax
But I can't focus if I don't fight back
When you said I love you, you was joking then
Ain't seen you in years but we ain't spoken since

Don't take this personally
I just can't be the person you need
What we got ain't working for me
And all it ever did was change the person in me

Don't take this personally
I just can't be the person you need
What we got ain't working for me
All it ever did was change the person in me

'Cause I really don't wanna be here alone
Too many people I don't see no more
Too many feelings I don't feel no more
'Cause I really don't wanna be here alone
Too many people I don't need no more
So many doubts that I stop keeping score

I've cried, I've cried so much
For you, baby

Evergreen, he tears me to pieces

You know you really made me hate myself
Had to stop before I break myself
Shoulda broke it off to date myself
You didn't deserve me at all

Please don't come home to me
Sweet Evergreen
He don't love

You see our love don't end

"Archetype"

There's a lot of boys in California
They don't get along like you and I
So pretty that you kill me softly
If you were to leave, if I were to die
You know I really want to risk it all
Kiss my collarbone, found my archetype

If you need me, I'll be right there waitin'
Hold me till I break thin, don't want this to end
(Don't want this to end)
Could you help me, help you think about me
I think of you daily, I could give you all
(I can give you all)

You're the only one that holds me
You're the only one that holds me

Yea, I know you're feeling paranoia

"Saving All My Love"

Aggressive how he God, yeah, you turning both ways
Don't you lie to yourself, boy, that's a cold place
See it on your whole face
Don't get attached to your body, it change with old age
I know you feel that cocaine
I see the lies through your nose
Prince Voil, I left my body exposed, you left with nada
I'm feeling brava
Sweat drip down my eyes, yeah, but he got that Prada
And the sun don't shine and my headphones died and the tide is low
Watch the wings collapse and you free fall down, that's a dirty road

Happiness can stay a while
But sometimes it don't come alright, no
So I wait, why wait
Do you chase Not patient
So I saved all my love for you

"Pretty Boy"

Pretty boy
Pretty like the ocean and the sky at night

And the wind crept in through our window
I can feel it on my skin
You're so pretty boy (Pretty boy)
I think of you so much, I couldn't love you more (I couldn't love you more)
I just dream of you (Dream of you)

Baby, it's us

"Ice Slippin"

When you comin' home
Home is where you supposed to be
Turn around, it's not too late, did I hurt you
You live too far away
Are you turnin' off your phone again
If I take back my words, would you return to me

Drive around in the snow, ice on the glass
Heat didn't work, couldn't see nothing (Ooh, ooh)
Ice slippin', swear to God, I could've hit the brakes, still on lock, almost said "Fuck it" (Fuck, fuck, fuck it)
And I hate being too much, could've just sighed to me that night, could've just said nothin'
I wish we would've just said nothin', nothin' (Nothin')

And you thought what you said would be for the best
But instead it broke me down

When you comin' home
Home is where you supposed to be
Turn around, it's not too late, did I hurt you
You live too far away
Are you turnin' off your phone again
If I take back my words, would you return to me

Water drops, cracked phone, couldn't even type, left you on read, know it did damage
Bloodstains on your fists, used to only fight when you was around no cameras
We used to be so young, didn't even act right, we didn't have no manners
We really didn't have no manners

If I'm bein' honest
If I said what I said, would you hate me
Would you hate me

When you comin' home

"Pilot"

She leaves, she got it better than me
Ooh, so much better than me
Can I lie when you're better than me (Better, better than me)
No

Let me know what you think, I'm outside, you know I been waitin' by the doorman (West, West Side)
You know I would've stayed in LA, makin' more bread if I knew you wasn't really tryna romance
Diamonds blindin' my eyes, wear all white on my chest like it's snowman
Ride the bike with no hands, like a pole dance

So dark that I wish you sun
So sad that I wish you love
I gave you a rose
Down by the coast

Sufferin' for you is growin' on me
And you know I still got you
By any means
Yeah, I got you
I got you still
Yeah, I got you still (Still, still)
I got you, still (I got you, still)

The club got me up
I miss you, I miss you

Jesus in my eyes, gonna fly it like a pilot
And my eyes move side to side like a light in my eyelids, and I
Checked by the hotel room, water drops in my forehead
Raindrops got my clothes wet
Got a drink and I poured that
Vacay ruined, where are my hoes
I been lookin' (Child), I don't know
Drivin' home drunk, on a buzz on my birthday
Eyes on God and my boss like a curly
Drivin' home drunk, on a buzz on my birthday
Eyes on God and my boss like a curly

It doesn't hurt forever
Forever

"3 Boys"

I don't wanna see any of your friends
I don't
I know it's hard for you to be alone
But that's where we're different
I'd be emotionless all the way if I could
I should take your advice and find someone new
So I could have two

I don't want to
Fell asleep with your hand on my skull
And my face in your lap
At the Bowery Hotel, missing you
How did I fall so fast
Seems like everything I do take me further from you

Three boys would work if I wasn't so tethered to you (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
What should I do (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I can't even choose (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm tethered to you, hey (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

You pray to God that it would leave (It won't leave)
All that you feel for me (All that you feel)
It won't be light, it won't feel right
My hand around your neck that you're tortured by
Spend a lot of time with you, I can't let go
I know there's some things you can't speak
But thoughts of a third make me weak, weak

I don't want to
Fell asleep with your hand on my skull
And my face in your lap
At the Bowery Hotel, missin' you
How did I fall so fast
Seems like everything I do take me further from you

Three boys would work if I wasn't so tethered to you (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
What should I do (What should I do)
I can't even choose (I can't even choose)
I'm tethered to you, hey (I'm tethered to you)

To you

"Algo"
(feat. Drayco McCoy)

I'm not so perfect, but I really try
That's enough affection coming for my life
Talk about it when it comes to users
I don't really like to chill with losers
I be running all the time

Por qu me amas t
Por qu me amas
Yo no tengo la opcin de volver pa' atrs
Yo no sabia que estabas conmigo
Nunca lo dijo, nunca lo dijo

Something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Oh, something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Something's on my mind

Ooh baby, let me touch you right here
Yeah, you're perfect, you know I'm worthless
Shouldn't deserve this
But you're right here
You twerkin
Girl, your body language moving in cursive
Mami I know you probably just like me 'cause you don't know me
Shorty I know molly hit highly, I'm also rolling
When the moonlight shines, and the hearts get stolen
Let's fucking get high 'til the morning
Come on here

I'm not so perfect, but I really try
That's enough affection coming for my life
Talk about it when it comes to users
I don't really like to chill with losers
I be running all the time

Por qu me amas t
Por qu me amas
Yo no tengo la opcin de volver pa' atrs
Yo no sabia que estabas conmigo
Nunca lo dijo, nunca lo dijo

Something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Something's on my mind (and it's not you)
Oh, something's on my mind (and it's not you)

"Beauty Boy"

I don't know
Stone's too cold
You're always on my mind
I'm smoking though
I'm hoping so
You always hit my line

I need my job
To see my beauty boy
And if you leave
Oh it's not my choice

I want to say I love him
I want to say I love him

You take all my love
I'm afraid I can't love no one again (one again)
You're all I want
(Oooh)

See, boy I love it when you come
I don't care for me
I don't know how to waste my time
Because he's seventeen
You came again
I don't know you love me for it
You came again
Don't try to say "no more"

I want to say I love him
I want to say I love him

You take all my love
I'm afraid I can't love no one again
You're all I want
(Oooh)

"Brakelights"

My car is a little like you
It's not working right now
Say that we're lovers
And we miss our mothers again
She don't really like you
Boy I kind of like you
You don't really like to mention that to me
Tell em write a haiku cuz
No one really likes me
I'm getting used to that

Days by, baby I don't got no brake lights
My car turns off when I go fast
Why would you want me
Days by, baby I don't got no brake lights
My car turns off when I go fast
Why would you want me

Days by, I'm losing the sunrise
I'll fall close to you
Losing my mind

"Hit Me Up"

Said, I've got some time I'm abusin'
Change my mind if you ever switch it up
And I won't waste my time if you pursue me
I'll let you know if you ever hit me up

Pretty boy, pretty boy
Not a city guy
I ain't intimate, I don't wanna fit
Fill you up, fill you up
Put your head down
By my headphones
I don't get it but
Pullin' up, pullin' up
In my car
All my friends
Coming down
Say you won't, say you won't
Ride with me, yeah

I've got some time, I'ma use it
Change my mind if you ever switch it up
And I won't waste my time if you pursue me
I'll let you know if you ever hit me up

You know I wouldn't tell you where to go
Nobody listens to the radio, baby
We're bending corners like we're running from the sun
The whip is turning different colors and you takin' on changes

Wish I could see you, come around and fill you up
Waited for you, baby, but you stood me up
Breaking what you gave me, wasn't good enough
What you gave me wasn't good enough

Wish I could see you come around
Like one more time
Faded like dumb it down
Over quick just like summer time
Baby, just double down
I bet you would fuck with me now

Said, I've got some time I'm abusin'
Change my mind if you ever switch it up
And I won't waste my time if you pursue me
I'll let you know if you ever hit me up

"Imagine U"

Sometimes you touch me on my face
I wish you could've never left me
You're picking up my phone, on 2
But you're not too far from me

'Cause I just want you to notice me

"Stayback (Remix)"
(feat. Bootsy Collins)

I got a lot on my mind, especially you
I can't help that you been on my mind
And I'm thinking about you, all the time
Yeah, I can't help that you been on my mind

You took all that I had to forget about you baby

Oh, but you know I still feel you
You know I been feeling you since way back

But you could never love me (But you could never love me)
So stay back, stay back

Well, uh, I just wanna lay with my baby, yeah
But this is how we do it

Tell 'em what we talking 'bout Omar

"Today"
(feat. Teo Halm)

Too many days I've felt they were strange
No wonder I feel like it's never gonna change
I just walk by, I'm thinking 'bout another
You don't, you don't even wanna know that
Today is just another day
Make my bed, I'm on my way
Checked my texts now I'm feeling like I'm gonna die
I should've took a five degree
Took some time to brush my teeth
Watched a movie, now I'm feeling like I'm gonna cry
I left my peace in the sheets

I don't know why I'm still here
When I should be asleep
I wish I was asleep
I wish I was asleep

I ain't runnin' from my shit, I'm just stressed out
I ain't far from the light, doing my best now
I'm just really trine swerve in the traffic
Feel the best when I'm lying in the street crack
Pretty far from okay, doing pretty bad
I'm just check up out my car, where my keys at
Pulling up and the key's in ignition
I just really think I need some attention

I should've took a five degree
Took some time to brush my teeth
Watched a movie, now I'm feeling like I wanna cry
I left my peace in the sheets

I don't know why I'm still here
When I should be asleep
I wish I was asleep
I wish I was asleep

"Unbothered"

I don't need what you need
I'm so unbothered by you
I used to think you're the only thing bright like the moon

I feel (oh)
I feel (oh)
I feel (oh)
I feel (oh)
I've been avoiding you, sorry if you feel alone
I'm doing fine

I don't need what you need
I'm so unbothered by you

"All We Know"

We've tried so hard to understand
But we can't
We held the world out in our hands
And you ran away

It takes some time to let you go
And it shows

'Cause all we know is falling, it falls
And remember 'cause I know that we won't forget at all

Now we could follow you back home
But we won't
Is this what you had waited for
Just to be alone

It takes some time to let you go
And it shows

'Cause all we know is falling, it falls
And remember 'cause I know that we won't forget at all

You never
You never said
This wasn't what you wanted
Was it Was it
This isn't what you wanted
This isn't what you wanted

'Cause all we know is falling, it falls
And remember 'cause I know that we won't forget at all

"Pressure"

Tell me where our time went
And if it was time well spent
Just don't let me fall asleep
Feeling empty again

'Cause I fear I might break
And I fear I can't take it
Tonight I'll lie awake
Feeling empty

I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off
Without you
I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off
Without you

Now that I'm losing hope
And there's nothing else to show
For all of the days that we spent
Carried away from home

Some things I'll never know
And I had to let them go
I'm sitting all alone
Feeling empty

I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off
Without you
I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off
Without you
(Without you)

Some things I'll never know
And I had to let them go
Some things I'll never know
And I had to let them go
But I'm sitting all alone
Feeling empty

I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off
Without you
Feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
You're better off
Without me

"Emergency"

I think we have an emergency
I think we have an emergency
If you thought I'd leave then you were wrong
'Cause I won't stop holding on
So are you listening
So are you watching me

If you thought I'd leave then you were wrong
'Cause I won't stop holding on
This is an emergency
So are you listening
And I can't pretend that I don't see this

It's really not your fault
That no one cares to talk about it
To talk about it

'Cause I've seen love die
Way too many times
When it deserved to be alive
(When it deserved to be alive)
And I've seen you cry
Way too many times
When you deserved to be alive
Alive

So you give up every chance you get
Just to feel new again
I think we have an emergency
I think we have an emergency
And you do your best to show me love
But you don't know what love is

So are you listening
So are you watching me
Well, I can't pretend that I don't see this

But it's really not your fault
That no one cares to talk about it
To talk about it

'Cause I've seen love die
Way too many times
When it deserved to be alive
(When it deserved to be alive)
And I've seen you cry
Way too many times
When you deserved to be alive
Alive

These scars, they will not fade away

No one cares to talk about it
To talk about it

'Cause I've seen love die
Way too many times
When it deserved to be alive
(When it deserved to be alive)
And I've seen you cry
Way too many times
When you deserved to be alive
Alive

"Brighter"

So this is how it goes
Well, I, I would have never known
And if it ends today
Well, I'll still say that you shine brighter than anyone

Now I think we're taking this too far
Don't you know that it's not this hard
Well, it's not this hard
But if you take what's yours and I take mine
Must we go there
Please, not this time
No, not this time

Well, this is not your fault
But if I'm without you then I will feel so small
And if you have to go
Well, always know that you shine brighter than anyone does

Now I think we're taking this too far
Don't you know that it's not this hard
Well, it's not this hard
But if you take what's yours and I take mine
Must we go there
Please, not this time
No, not this time

If you run away now
Will you come back around
And if you ran away
I'd still wave goodbye watching you shine bright

Now I think we're taking this too far
Don't you know that it's not this hard
Well, it's not this hard
But if you take what's yours and I take mine
Must we go there
Please, not this time
No, not this time

(You shine bright)
And I'll wave goodbye watching you shine bright
(You shine bright)
And I'll wave goodbye tonight
(You shine bright)

"Here We Go Again"

And here we go again
With all the things we said
And not a minute spent
To think that we'd regret
So we just take it back
These words and hold our breath
Forget the things we swore we meant

I'll write you just to let you know
That I'm alright
Can't say I'm sad to see you go
'Cause I'm not
(No, I'm not)
Well, I'm not

And here we go again
With all the things we did
And now I'm wondering
Just who would I have been
To be the one attached
At all times to your hip
Forget the things we swore we meant

I'll write you just to let you know
That I'm alright
Can't say I'm sad to see you go
'Cause I'm not
(No, I'm not)
Well, I'm not
(No, I'm not)
Oh-oh
(No, I'm not)

I'll write you to let you know
That I'm alright
Can't say I'm sad to see you go
'Cause I'm not
(No, I'm not)
Well, I'm not
(No, I'm not)
I'm not
I'm not

(And here we go again)
(With all the things we said
And not a minute spent)
(To think that we'd regret
So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
No
(So we just take it back)
I'm not
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
I'm not
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back...)

"Never Let This Go"

Maybe if my heart stops beating, it won't hurt this much
And never will I have to answer again to anyone

Please, don't get me wrong

Because I'll never let this go
But I can't find the words to tell you
I don't wanna be alone (Don't wanna be alone)
But now I feel like I don't know you
Whoa

One day, you'll get sick of saying that everything's alright
And by then, I'm sure I'll be pretending just like I am tonight

Please, don't get me wrong

Because I'll never let this go
But I can't find the words to tell you
I don't wanna be alone (Don't wanna be alone)
But now I feel like I don't know you

Let this go
Let this go

But I'll never let this go
But I can't find the words to tell you
I don't wanna be alone (Don't wanna be alone)
But now I feel like I don't know you
And I'll never let this go (Never let this go)
But I can't find the words to tell you
That now I feel like I don't know you

"Whoa"

I've hoped for change
And it gets better everyday
I've hoped for change
But still I feel the same

There's something wrong
'Cause everybody knows
That we can do this on our own

And we've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

We're doing fine
And it gets better every time
We're doing fine
But I'll let you decide

There's something wrong
'Cause everybody knows
That we can do this on our own

And we've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
And we've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

And I'll confess
That I can be a little selfish
Yeah, I'll admit
I don't want you to help me through this
I don't want to start over again

And we've got everybody singing
And we've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
And we've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

And I'll confess
That I can be a little selfish, I can, I can
Yeah, I'll admit
I don't want you to get me through this
I don't want to start over again

"Conspiracy"

Please, speak softly for they will hear us
And they'll find out why we don't trust them
Speak up, dear, 'cause I cannot hear you
I need to know why we don't trust them

Explain to me this conspiracy against me
Yeah-eh, yeah
And tell me how I've lost my power
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

Where can I turn 'Cause I need something more
Surrounded by uncertainty, I'm so unsure
Tell me why I feel so alone
'Cause I need to know to whom do I owe

Explain to me this conspiracy against me
Yeah-eh, yeah
And tell me how I've lost my power
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

I thought that we'd make it
Because you said that we'd make it through
And when all security fails
Will you be there to help me through

Explain to me this conspiracy against me
Yeah-eh, yeah
And tell me how I've lost my power
Oh-oh

I've lost my power

"Franklin"

And when we get home, I know we won't be home at all
This place we live, it is not where we belong
And I miss who we were and the town that we could call our own
Going back to get away after everything has changed

'Cause you remind me of a time when we were so alive
Everything has changed
Do you remember that
Do you remember that
Everything has changed
'Cause you help me push aside all that I have left behind
Everything is changed
Do you remember that
Do you remember that

So we stand here now and no one knows us at all
I won't get used to this, I won't get used to being gone
And going back won't feel the same if we aren't staying
Going back to get away after everything has changed

'Cause you remind me of a time when we were so alive
Everything has changed
Do you remember that
Do you remember that
Everything has changed
'Cause you help me push aside all that I have left behind
Everything is changed
Do you remember that

We can't go back, we can't go back at all
It's taking up our time
We can't go back, we can't go back at all
It's taking up our time
We can't go back, we can't go back at all
It's taking up our time
Taking up our time

'Cause you remind me of a time
When we were so alive
Do you remember that
Do you remember that

"My Heart"

I am finding out
That maybe I was wrong
That I've fallen down
And I can't do this alone

Stay with me
This is what I need, please

Sing us a song

Take this time to realize
That you always shut your eyes
In the midst of trial
And everything is always right

(And I think that it's time)
This battle must be won

That you always force a smile
In the midst of trial
And everything is always right

(And I think that it's time)
This battle must be won
(But you pushed it aside)
Pushed it aside, pretend that it's gone

This circle never ends
And it's time you
Just face it, don't pretend
That it's over
This circle never ends
And it's time you
Just face it, don't pretend
That it's over

And it never ends
It never ends
And it never ends
(And it never ends)
No, it never ends

This circle never ends
And it's time you
Just face it, don't pretend
That it's over
This circle never ends
And it's time you
Just face it, don't pretend
That it's over
It's over

That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa

I wonder
How am I supposed to feel when you're not here

Every bridge I ever built when you were here

"Hallelujah"

Somehow everything's gonna fall right into place
If we only had a way to make it all fall faster every day
If only time flew like a dove
Well, God, make it fly faster than I'm falling in love

This time, we're not giving up
Let's make it last forever
Screaming, "Hallelujah"
We'll make it last forever

Holding on to patience wearing thin
I can't force these eyes to see the end
If only time flew like a dove
Well, we could watch it fly and just keep looking up

This time, we're not giving up
Let's make it last forever
Screaming, "Hallelujah"
We'll make it last forever

And we've got time on our hands
(We've got time) Got nothing but time on our hands
Got nothing but, got nothing but
(We've got time) Got nothing but time on our hands

This time, we're not giving up
Oh, let's make it last forever
Screaming, "Hallelujah" ("Hallelujah")
"Hallelujah"

"Misery Business"

(Hit that, hit that snare)

I'm in the business of misery
Let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine she caught him by the mouth

I waited eight long months
She finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie he was the only one for me
Two weeks we caught on fire
She's got it out for me
But I wear the biggest smile

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But, God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could then you know you would
'Cause, God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

Second chances they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Well I refuse, I refuse, I refuse

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But, God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him right now
And if you could then you know you would
'Cause, God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

I watched his wildest dreams come true
Not one of them involving you
Just watch my wildest dreams come true
Not one of them involving

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But, God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could then you know you would
'Cause, God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

"When It Rains"

And when it rains
On this side of town it touches everything
Just say it again and mean it
We don't miss a thing

You made yourself a bed
At the bottom of the blackest hole (blackest hole)
And convinced yourself that
It's not the reason you don't see the sun anymore

And no, oh, how could you do it
Oh, I, I never saw it coming
No, oh, I need the ending
So why can't you stay
Just long enough to explain

And when it rains
Well, you always find an escape
Just running away
From all of the ones who love you
From everything

You made yourself a bed
At the bottom of the blackest hole (blackest hole)
And you'll sleep 'til May
And you'll say that you don't wanna see the sun anymore

And no, oh, how could you do it
Oh, I, I never saw it coming
And no, oh, I need the ending
So why can't you stay just long enough to explain

Take your time
Take my time

Take these chances to turn it around (take your time)
Just take these chances, we'll make it somehow
And take these chances to turn it around (take my...)
Just turn it around

No, how could you do it
Oh, I, I never saw it coming
No, oh, how could you do it
Oh, I, I never saw it coming
No, oh, how could you do it
Oh, I, I never saw it coming
No, oh I need an ending
So why can't you stay
Just long enough to explain

You can take your time
Take my time

"Let The Flames Begin"

What a shame we all became such fragile, broken things
A memory remains just a tiny spark
I give it all my oxygen
To let the flames begin
So let the flames begin

Oh, glory
Oh, glory
This is how we'll dance when
When they try to take us down
This is what we'll be, oh, glory

Somewhere weakness is our strength
And I'll die searching for it
I can't let myself regret such selfishness
My pain and oh the trouble caused
No matter how long
I believe that there's hope
Buried beneath it all and
Hiding beneath it all, and
Growing beneath it all

This is how we'll dance when
When they try to take us down
This is how we'll sing (oh)
This is how we'll stand when
When they burn our houses down
This is what we'll be, oh, glory

Reaching as I sink down into light (Into light)
Reaching as I sink down into light (Into light)

This is how we'll dance when
When they try to take us down
This is how we'll sing (oh)
This is how we'll stand when
When they burn our houses down
This is what we'll be, oh, glory

"Miracle"

I've gone for too long living like I'm not alive
So I'm gonna start over tonight
Beginning with you and I
When this memory fades
I'm gonna make sure it's replaced
With chances taken
Hope embraced
And have I told you

I'm not going
'Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
And I'm not leaving
I won't let you
Let you give up on a miracle
When it might save you

We've learned to run from
Anything uncomfortable
We've tied our pain below and no one ever has to know
That inside we're broken
I try to patch things up again
To count my tears and kill these fears
But have I told you, have I

I'm not going
'Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
And I'm not leaving
I won't let you
Let you give up on a miracle
When it might save you

It's not faith if (faith if), if you use your eyes
Oh why
We'll get it right this time (this time)
Let's leave this all behind
Oh why
We'll get it right this time
It's not faith if you're using your eyes
Oh why

I've gone for too long living like I'm not alive
So I'm gonna start over tonight
Beginning with you and

I don't want to run from anything uncomfortable
I just want, no
I just need this pain to end right here

I'm not going
'Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
And I'm not leaving
I won't let you
Let you give up on a miracle
'Cause it might save you

Yeah, it might save you
Oh, it might save you

It's not faith if, if you use your eyes
If you use your eyes
If you use your eyes

"crushcrushcrush"

I got a lot to say to you, yeah, I got a lot to say
I notice your eyes are always glued to me
You're keeping them here and it makes no sense at all

They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies
They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies

Crush, crush, crush
Crush, crush
(Two, three, four)

Nothing compares to a quiet evening alone
Just the one, two, I was just counting on
That never happens, I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than this

If you want to play it like a game
Well, come on, come on, let's play
'Cause I'd rather waste my life pretending
Than have to forget you for one whole minute

They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies
They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies

Crush, crush, crush
Crush, crush
(Two, three, four)

Nothing compares to a quiet evening alone
Just the one, two, I was just counting on
That never happens, I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than this now

Rock and roll, baby, don't you know
That we're all alone now I need something to sing about
Rock and roll, honey, don't you know, baby
We're all alone now I need something to sing about
Rock and roll, hey, don't you know, baby
We're all alone now Give me something to sing about

Nothing compares to a quiet evening alone
Just the one, two, I was just counting on
That never happens, I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than, no

Nothing compares to a quiet evening alone
Just the one, two, I was just counting on
That never happens, I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than, more than this

Ohoh ohoh ohoh
Oooh...

"We Are Broken"

I am outside
And I've been waiting for the sun
With my wide eyes
I've seen worlds that don't belong
My mouth is dry with words I cannot verbalize
Tell me why we live like this

Keep me safe inside
Your arms like towers
Tower over me

Yeah
'Cause we are broken
What must we do to restore
Our innocence
And all the promise we adored
Give us life again
'Cause we just wanna be whole

Lock the doors
'Cause I'd like to capture this voice
It came to me tonight
So everyone will have a choice
And under red lights
I'll show myself it wasn't forged
We're at war
We live like this

Keep me safe inside
Your arms like towers
Tower over me

'Cause we are broken
What must we do to restore
Our innocence
And all the promise we adored
Give us life again
'Cause we just wanna be whole

Tower over me
Tower over me

And I'll take the truth at any cost

'Cause we are broken
What must we do to restore
Our innocence
And all the promise we adored
Give us life again
'Cause we just wanna be whole

"Fences"

I'm sitting in a room
Made up of only big white walls and in the hall
There are people looking through
The window in the door
They know exactly what we're here for

Don't look up
Just let them think
There's no place else
You'd rather be

You're always on display
For everyone to watch and learn from
Don't you know by now
You can't turn back
Because this road is all you'll ever have

And it's obvious that you're dying, dying
Just living proof that the camera's lying
And oh oh open wide, 'cause this is your night
So smile, 'cause you'll go out in style
You'll go out in style

If you let me I could
I'd show you how to build your fences
Set restrictions, separate from the world
The constant battle that you hate to fight
Just blame the limelight

Don't look up
Just let them think
There's no place else
You'd rather be

And now you can't turn back
Because this road is all you'll ever have

And it's obvious that you're dying, dying
Just living proof that the camera's lying
And oh oh open wide, 'cause this is your night
So smile

Yeah, yeah you're asking for it
With every breath that you breathe in
Just breathe it in
Yeah, yeah well you're just a mess
You do all this big talking
So now let's see you walk it
I said let's see you walk it

Yeah, yeah well you're just a mess
You do all this big talking
So now let's see you walk it
I said let's see you walk it

And it's obvious that you're dying, dying
Just living proof that the camera's lying
And oh oh open wide, yeah oh oh open wide
Yeah, oh oh open wide
'Cause you'll go out in style
You'll go out in style

"Born For This"

Oh no I just keep on falling
(Back to the same old...)
And where's hope when misery comes crawling
(Oh my way, ay...)
With your faith you'll trigger a landslide
(Victory)
To kill off this common sense of mine

It takes acquired minds to taste, to taste, to taste this wine
You can't down it with your eyes
So we don't need the headlines
We don't need the headlines
We just want

(We want the airwaves back, we want the airwaves back)

Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now
Everybody live like it's the last day you will ever see
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now

Right now you're the only reason
(I'm not letting go, oh...)
And time out if everyone's worth pleasing
(Ha-ha)
You'll trigger a landslide
(Victory)
To kill off their finite state of mind

It takes acquired minds to taste, to taste, to taste this wine
You can't down it with your eyes
So we don't need the headlines
No, we don't want your headlines
We just want

(We want the airwaves back, we want the airwaves back)

Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now
Everybody live like it's the last day you will ever see
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now
Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure

Alright, so you think you're ready
OK, then you say this with me
Go
We were born for this
We were born for this
Alright, so you think you're ready
OK, then you say this with me
Go
We were born for this
We were born for this
We were born for this
We were born for this

We were born for
We were born for

Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure
Everybody live like it's the last day you will ever see
Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure now
Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure
Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure

We were born for this
We were born for this
We were born for this

"Temporary"

I used to be so quick, so clever
I used to know myself much better
Anyone can see that this is only permanent
Temporary, it never hurts to try

And it's all a game
I know we'll stay the same
But repetition ends in failure
And every time I see it in your eyes
When repetition ends, we'll start over

Now I'm a walking contradiction
So tell me what's wrong with this picture
Cause anyone can see that this is only permanent
Temporary, so don't hurt me this time

And it's all a game
I know we'll stay the same
But repetition ends in failure
And every time I see it in your eyes
When repetition ends, we'll start over

So give it up, just give up
Give it up, give up
So give it up, just give up
Give it up, give up

And it's all a game
I know we'll stay the same
But repetition ends in failure
And every time I see it in your eyes
When repetition ends, we'll start over

We'll start over

"Decoy"

Close your eyes and make believe this is where you wanna be
Forgetting all the memories, try to forget love 'cause love's forgotten me

Well, hey, hey, baby, it's never too late
Pretty soon you won't remember a thing
And I'll be distant
The stars reminiscing
Your heart's been wasted on me

You've never been so used as I'm using you, abusing you
My little decoy
Don't look so blue, you should've seen right through
I'm using you, my little decoy
My little decoy

Live your life inside a dream
Time is changing everything
Forgetting all the memories
And I'm forced into you just 'cause you're into me

Well, hey, hey, baby, it's never too late
When I'm gone you won't remember a thing
But I can't stay
And you know I won't wait
I was gone from the very first day

You've never been so used as I'm using you, abusing you
My little decoy
Don't look so blue, you should've seen right through
I'm using you, my little decoy

Oh, oh
I'm not sorry at all
(Not sorry at all, not sorry. No.)
I won't be sorry at all
(Not sorry at all, not sorry. No.)
I'd do it over again

Don't look so blue, my little decoy
You should've seen right through, my little decoy
You've never been so used, my little decoy
And so I'm using you, my little decoy

"Stop This Song (Lovesick Melody)"

You say the sweetest things and I can't keep my heart from singing
Along to the sound of your song My stupid feet keep moving
To this 44 beat, I'm in time with you
Whoa, to this 44 beat I would die for you (die for you)

(Someone stop this)
I've gone too far to come back from here
But you don't have a clue
You don't know what you do to me

Won't someone stop this song
So I won't sing along
Someone stop this song
So I won't sing

I never let love in
So I could keep my heart from hurting
The longer that I live with this idea, the more I sink into this 44 beat
I'm in time with you
Whoa, to this 44 beat I would die for you (let's stop this song)

I've gone too far to come back from here
But you don't have a clue
You don't know what you do to me
I've come too far to get over you
And you don't have a clue
You don't know what you do to me

Can't someone stop this song
So I won't sing along
Someone stop this song
So I won't sing

Your lovesick melody
Is gonna get the best of me tonight
But you won't get to me if I don't sing

It creeps in like a spider
Can't be killed, although I try and try to
Well, don't you see I'm falling
Don't wanna love you, but I do

(Lovesick melody) Can someone stop this song, so I won't sing along
(Lovesick melody, oh) Can someone stop this song, so I won't sing
Your lovesick melody
Is gonna get the best of me tonight
But you won't get to me, no
You won't get to me 'cause I won't sing

"Rewind"

Don't come looking for me
'Cause I'll be right here with the words you said
Looking for the words that you say
You know what you did you know
And how can anybody forget the promise that you made
'Cause this is how a promise breaks
I always knew you'd fall through
And now you're proof

Rewind to the first time
That I felt it coming
I knew it would not last
Rewind to the first time
That I felt it coming
Make it quick, make it painless
Don't tell me lies just say goodbye

And now you're running from me
So cool, so scared of what you might have said
And no one's ever looked away
'Cause we know what you did, we know
If I told anybody, that we would soon forget your name
And you would never have a place
I always knew you'd fall through
And now you're proof

Rewind to the first time
That I felt it coming
I knew it would not last
Rewind to the first time
That I felt it coming
Make it quick, make it painless
Don't tell me lies just say goodbye

Please don't say too much oh, I
Think we've heard enough from you
Oh

Rewind to the first time
That I felt it coming
I knew it would not last
Rewind to the first time
That I felt it coming
Make it quick, make it painless
Don't tell me lies just say goodbye
Don't tell me lies just say goodbye

"Careful"

I settled down a twisted up frown
Disguised as a smile, well
You would've never known

I had it all
But not what I wanted
'Cause hope for me was a place uncharted and overgrown

You'd make your way in
I'd resist you just like this

You can't tell me to feel
The truth never set me free
So, I did it myself

You can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out a little more
More
More
More, more

Open your eyes
Like I opened mine
It's only the real world
A life you will never know

Shifting your weight
To throw off the pain
Well you can ignore it
But only for so long

You look like I did
You resist me just like this

You can't tell me to heal
And it hurts remembering
How it felt to shut down

Can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out a little more
More
More
More, more

The truth never set me free
The truth never set me free
The truth never set me free
So, I'll do it myself

You can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out

Can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out
More
More
More
More, more

"Ignorance"

If I'm a bad person, you don't like me
Well, I guess I'll make my own way
It's a circle, a mean cycle
I can't excite you anymore

Where's your gavel Your jury
What's my offense this time
You're not a judge but if you're gonna judge me
Well, sentence me to another life

Don't wanna hear your sad songs
I don't wanna feel your pain
When you swear it's all my fault
'Cause you know we're not the same
No, we're not the same, no, oh, we're not the same

Yeah, the friends who stuck together
We wrote our names in blood
But I guess you can't accept that the change is good, hey
It's good, hey, it's good

Well, you treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you, sir
I guess I'll go, I best be on my way out

You treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you, sir
I guess I'll go, I best be on my way out

Ignorance is your new best friend
Ignorance is your new best friend

This is the best thing that could've happened
Any longer, and I wouldn't have made it
It's not a war, no, it's not a rapture
I'm just a person, but you can't take it

The same tricks that, that once fooled me
They won't get you anywhere
I'm not the same kid from your memory
Well, now I can fend for myself

Don't wanna hear your sad songs
I don't wanna feel your pain
When you swear it's all my fault
'Cause you know we're not the same
No, we're not the same, no, oh, we're not the same

Yeah, we used to stick together
We wrote our names in blood
But I guess you can't accept that the change is good, hey
It's good, hey, it's good

Well, you treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you, sir
Well, I guess I'll go, I best be on my way out

You treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you, sir
Well, I guess I'll go, I best be on my way out

Ignorance is your new best friend
Ignorance is your new best friend
Ignorance is your new best friend
Ignorance is your new best friend

Well, you treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you, sir
Well, I guess I'll go, I best be on my way out

You treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you, sir
I guess I'll go, I best be on my way out

"Playing God"

I can't make my own decisions
Or make any with precision
Well, maybe you should tie me up
So I don't go where you don't want me

You say that I've been changing
That I'm not just simply aging
Yeah, how could that be logical
Just keep on cramming ideas down my throat
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

You don't have to believe me
But the way I, way I see it
Next time you point a finger
I might have to bend it back
Or break it, break it off
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror

If God's the game that you're playing
Well, we must get more acquainted
Because it has to be so lonely
To be the only one who's holy

It's just my humble opinion
But it's one that I believe in
You don't deserve a point of view
If the only thing you see is you
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

You don't have to believe me
But the way I, way I see it
Next time you point a finger
I might have to bend it back
Or break it, break it off
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror

This is the last second chance
(I'll point you to the mirror)
I'm half as good as it gets
(I'll point you to the mirror)
I'm on both sides of the fence
(I'll point you to the mirror)
Without a hint of regret
I'll hold you to it

I know you don't believe me
But the way I, way I see it
Next time you point a finger
I might have to bend it back
Or break it, break it off
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror

I know you won't believe me
But the way I, way I see it
Next time you point a finger
I might have to bend it back
Or break it, break it off
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror

"Brick By Boring Brick"

She lives in a fairy tale
Somewhere too far for us to find
Forgotten the taste and smell
Of a world that she's left behind
It's all about the exposure the lens I told her
The angles are all wrong now
She's ripping wings off of butterflies

Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds
Well go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle

Ba da ba ba da ba ba da

So one day he found her crying
Coiled up on the dirty ground
Her prince finally came to save her
And the rest you can figure out
But it was a trick
And the clock struck twelve
Well make sure to build your home brick by boring brick
Or the wolf's gonna blow it down

Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds

Well go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
We'll bury the castle, bury the castle

Oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa

Well you built up a world of magic
Because your real life is tragic
Yeah you built up a world of magic

If it's not real
You can't hold it in your hand
You can't feel it with your heart
And I won't believe it
But if it's true
You can see it with your eyes
Oh, even in the dark
And that's where I want to be, yeah

(You'll be better off without me)
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle (Ooh), bury the castle
(You'll be better off without me)
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle (Ooh), bury the castle

Ba da ba ba da ba ba da
Ba da ba ba ba da ba ba
Ba da ba ba da ba ba da
Ba da ba ba ba ba ba ba

Ba da ba ba da ba ba da
Ba da ba ba ba da ba ba
Ba da ba ba da ba ba da
Ba da ba ba ba ba ba ba

"Turn It Off"

I scraped my knees while I was praying
And found a demon in my safest haven
Seems like it's getting harder to believe in anything
Than just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts

I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride
To see nothing in the light
But turn it off in all my spite, in all my spite
I'll turn it off

And the worst part is, before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I will realize that
I'm better off when I hit the bottom

The tragedy, it seems unending
I'm watching everyone I looked up to breaking, bending
We're taking shortcuts and false solutions
Just to come out the hero

Well I can see behind the curtain (I can see now)
The wheels are cranking turning
It's all wrong the way we're working
Towards a goal, that's non-existent, it's non-existent
But we just keep believing

And the worst part is, before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom

I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride
To see nothing in the light
But turn it off in all my spite, in all my spite
I'll turn it off
Just turn it off

Again
Again, again

And the worst part is, before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom

And the worst part is, before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom

"The Only Exception"

When I was younger I saw my daddy cry
And curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it

And my momma swore
That she would never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

But darling
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul
That love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone
Or keep a straight face

And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself
That I'm content with loneliness

Because none of it was ever worth the risk

Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality
But I can't let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream
Oh-oh-oh-oh

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

And I'm on my way to believing
Oh, and I'm on my way to believing

"Feeling Sorry"

We still live in the same town, well, don't we
But I don't see you around anymore
I go to all the same places
Not even a trace of you
Your days are numbered at 24

And I'm getting bored waiting 'round for you
We're not getting any younger
And I won't look back 'cause there's no use
It's time to move forward

I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cave
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time for feeling sorry

Well, I try not to think of what might happen
When your reality it finally cuts through
Well, as for me I got out and I'm on the road
The worst part is that this (this), this could be you

You know it, too
You can't run from your shame
You're not getting any younger
And time keeps passing by
But you wave it away
It's time to roll over

I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cave
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time for feeling sorry

And all the best lies
They are told with fingers tied
So cross 'em tight
Won't you promise me tonight
If it's the last thing you do
You'll get out

I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cave
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
Got no time, got no time

I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cave
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time
I've got no time for feeling sorry
I've got no time for feeling sorry

"Looking Up"

Things are looking up
Oh, finally
I thought I'd never see the day
When you'd smile at me

We always pull through
Oh, when we try
I'm always wrong
But you're never right
Oh, you're never right

Honestly, can you believe
We crossed the world while it's asleep
I'd never trade it in
'Cause I've always wanted this and
It's not a dream anymore, no
It's not a dream anymore
It's worth fighting for

Could've given up so easily
I was a few cheap shots away
From the end of me

Taking for granted
Most everything
That I would've died for
Just yesterday
Just yesterday

Honestly, can you believe
We crossed the world while it's asleep
I'd never trade it in
'Cause I've always wanted this and
It's not a dream anymore, no
It's not a dream anymore
It's worth fighting for

God knows the world doesn't need another band
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
But what a waste it would've been
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
I can't believe we almost hung it up
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
We're just getting started
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

Honestly, can you believe
We crossed the world while it's asleep
I'd never trade it in
'Cause I've always wanted this and
It's not a dream anymore, no
It's not a dream anymore, no, oh
It's not a dream anymore, no, oh
It's not a dream anymore
It's worth fighting for

I can't believe we almost hung it up
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
We're just getting started
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
I can't believe we almost hung it up
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
We're just getting started
Yeah, we're just getting started

"Where The Lines Overlap"

Give me attention
I need it now
Too much distance
To measure it out
Out loud
Tracing patterns across a personal map
And making pictures where the lines overlap
Where the lines overlap

No one is as lucky as us
We're not at the end but oh we already won
No, no, no one is as lucky as us
Is as lucky as us

Call me over
And tell me how, well, you got so far
Never making a single sound
I'm not used to it but I can learn
There's nothing to it
I've never been happier
Never been happier

No one is as lucky as us
We're not at the end but oh we already won
Oh, no, no one is as lucky as us
Is as lucky as us

Now I've got a feeling
If I sang this loud enough
You would sing it back to me
I've got a feeling
If I sang this loud enough
You would sing it back to me

I've got a feeling
I've got a feeling
That you would sing it back to me
That you would sing it back to me

No one is as lucky as us
We're not at the end but oh we already won
Oh, no, no one (no one) is as lucky as us
Is as lucky as us
Is as lucky as us

"Misguided Ghosts"

I am going away for a while
But I'll be back don't try and follow me
'Cause I'll return as soon as possible

See, I'm trying to find my place
But it might not be here where I feel safe
We all learn to make mistakes

And run from them, from them
With no direction
We'll run from them, from them
With no conviction

'Cause I'm just one of those ghosts
Travelin' endlessly
Don't need no roads
In fact, they follow me
And we just go in circles

But now I'm told that this is life
And pain is just a simple compromise
So we can get what we want out of it

Would someone care to classify
Our broken hearts and twisted minds
So I can find someone to rely on

And run to them, to them
Full-speed ahead
Oh, you are not useless
We are just

Misguided ghosts
Travelin' endlessly
The ones we trusted the most
Pushed us far away
And there's no one road
And we should not be the same
But I'm just a ghost
And still they echo me
They echo me in circles

"All I Wanted"

Think of me when you're out
When you're out there
I'll beg you nice from my knees
And when the world treats you way too fairly
Well it's a shame I'm a dream

All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you

I think I'll pace my apartment a few times
And fall asleep on the couch
And wake up early to black and white reruns
That escape from my mouth

Oh-oh, oh-oh

All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you

I could follow you to the beginning
Just to relive the start
Maybe then we'd remember to slow down
At all of our favorite parts

All I wanted was you

All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you

"Decode"

How can I decide what's right
When you're clouding up my mind
I can't win your losing fight all the time
How can I ever own what's mine
When you're always taking sides
But you won't take away my pride
No not this time
Not this time

How did we get here
Well, I used to know you so well
How did we get here
Well, I think I know

The truth is hiding in your eyes
And it's hanging on your tongue
Just boiling in my blood
But you think that I can't see
What kind of man that you are
If you're a man at all
Well, I will figure this one out
On my own
(I'm screaming, "I love you so")
On my own
(My thoughts you can't decode)

How did we get here
Well, I used to know you so well, yeah
How did we get here
Well, I think I know

Do you see what we've done
We've gone and made such fools of ourselves
Do you see what we've done
We've gone and made such fools of ourselves

Yeah...

How did we get here
Well, I used to know you so well, yeah, yeah
How did we get here
[Album version] Well, I used to know you so well
[Acoustic version] Why won't you show yourself

I think I know
I think I know

Ooh, there is something
I see in you
It might kill me
I want it to be true

"Fast In My Car"

Been through the wringer a couple times
I came out callous and cruel
And my two friends know this very well
Because they went through it too

The three of us were initiates
We had to learn how to deal
And when we spotted a second chance
We had to learn how to steal

Hollowed out and filled up with hate
All we want is you to give us a break

We're driving fast in my car
We've got our riot gear on but we just want to have fun
No, we're not looking for violence, no oh oh oh
Tonight we want to have fun

No one's the same as they used to be
Much as we try to pretend
No one's as innocent as could be
We all fall short, we all sin

But now we aren't looking backward
We won't try raising the dead
We only see what's in front of us
We only see straight ahead

Hollowed out and filled up with hate
All we want is you to give us a break

We're driving fast in my car
We've got our riot gear on but we just want to have fun
No, we're not looking for violence, no oh oh oh
Tonight we want to have fun

Get in my car and we'll drive around
We'll make believe we are free
Already proved we can tough it out

And we get along so sweetly

We're driving fast in my car
We've got our riot gear on but we just want to have fun
No, we're not looking for violence, no oh oh oh
Tonight we want to have fun (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

We're driving fast in my car
We're driving fast in my car
And we're not looking for violence, no oh oh oh
We're driving fast in my car
And we just want to have fun

"Now"

Don't try to take this from me
Don't try to take this from me
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow

Don't try to take this from me
Don't try to take this from me
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow

Feels like I'm waking from the dead
And everyone's been waitin' on me
'Least now I'll never have to wonder
What it's like to sleep a year away
But weren't we indestructible
I thought that we could brave it all (all)
I never thought that what would take me out
Was hiding down below

Lost the battle, win the war
I'm bringing my sinking ship back to the shore
Starting over or head back in
There's a time and a place to die, but this ain't it

If there's a future, we want it
(Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow)
If there's a future, we want it
(Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow)
If there's a future, we want it
(Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow)
If there's a future, we want it
(Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow)

Don't try to take this from me
Don't try to take this from me
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow

Don't try to take this from me
Don't try to take this from me
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow

Wish I could find a crystal ball
For the days I feel completely worthless
You know I'd use it all for good
I would not take it for granted (granted)
Instead I have some memories... For the days I don't feel anything
At the least, they will remind me not to make the same mistakes again

Lost the battle, win the war
I'm bringing my sinking ship back to the shore
We're starting over or head back in
There's a time and a place to die but this ain't it

If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow

There's a time and a place to die
There's a time and a place to die
And this ain't it
There's a time and a place to die
And this ain't it, this ain't it
This ain't it

There's a time and a place to die
There's a time and a place to die
But this ain't it, no

If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
If there's a future, we want it now
Now
(Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow)

If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow

"Grow Up"

I told 'em all where to stick it
I left town with a dime to my name
Said I'm done with all of my fake friends
Self-righteous pawns in a losing game

Got my band and a light that won't go out
Been burning since the day I was born
So I cried just a little then I'll dry my eyes
'Cause I'm not a little girl no more

Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind

Stood in line for so long just to picket
Something I won't ever understand
Aren't you tired of always being mad at the world
Won't you just admit you don't care

And, lady, I don't want your pity
So don't feel sad for me
I got a love I would die for and a song to sing
Maybe we're both just living out our dream

And some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind

We get along for the most part
Me and reality, the light and the dark
We live alone, two different worlds
Me in a fantasy, you in your memories
But we get along

We get along
(For the most part)
We get along
(yeah, for the most part)
We get along
(For the most part)
We get along

We get along
We get along

Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind (leave you behind)
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind (leave you behind)

Some of us have to grow up sometimes (we grow up, never grow old)
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes (we grow up, never grow old)
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind

"Daydreaming"

Living in a city of sleepless people
Who all know the limits and won't go too far outside the lines
'Cause they're out of their minds
I wanna get out and build my own home
On a street where reality is not much different from dreams I've had
A dream is all I have

Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming
Daydreaming into the night

Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming
Daydreaming into the night

And I'm alright

Creep past the hours like the shorter hand on the clock
Hanging on a wall of a schoolhouse somewhere
We wait for the bell
And we dream of somewhere else

Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming
Daydreaming into the night

Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming
Daydreaming into the night

And I'm alright

It's not that I won't remember where I'm from
Just don't wanna be here no more
It's not enough, ha-ah-ah-ah-oh
(We're only half alive)
I'm gonna go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(We're only half alive)
Where the rest of the dreamers go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(We're only half alive)
Where the dreamers go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-ooh

Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time (a dream is all I have)
Daydreaming
Daydreaming into the night
And I'm alright

Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time (a dream is all I have)
Daydreamer
We used to be half alive
Now I'm alright

I'm alright
I'm alright

"Interlude Moving On"

Let 'em have their time
Sit back and let 'em shine
Let 'em rise and rise
'Cause one day they're gonna fall
Let 'em soak in the sun
Sit back and let 'em have their fun
Let 'em spill their guts
'Cause one day they're gonna slip on 'em

Well, I could be angry, but you're not worth the fight
And besides I'm moving on
I've counted to ten and now I'm feeling alright
And besides I'm moving on

Let 'em play their songs
Let 'em say what's right and wrong
Let 'em do their thing
'Cause they'll never be you and me
We've got our own style
We've got a way of living life
If they can't get down
Well, we don't need them around

Well, I could be angry, but you're not worth the fight
And besides I'm moving on
I've counted to ten and now I'm feeling alright
And besides I'm moving
Yes, I'm moving
Besides I'm moving on

"Ain't It Fun"

I don't mind
Lettin' you down easy, but just give it time
If it don't hurt now, well, just wait, just wait a while
You're not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feedin' on

So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, uh-uh-uh)
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you

Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world
Ain't it good
Bein' all alone

Where you're from
You might be the one who's runnin' things
Well, you could ring anybody's bell and get what you want
You see, it's easy to ignore trouble
When you're livin' in a bubble

So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you
(Mm-mmm, uh-uh)
So what are you gonna do
When nobody wants to fool with you
(Oh-oh-oh, uh-uh-uh)

Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world
Ain't it good
Bein' all alone
(Oh-oh-oh) Ain't it good to be on your own
(Oh-oh-oh) Ain't it fun you can't count on no one
(Uh-uh-uh) Ain't it good to be on your own
(Uh-uh-uh) Ain't it fun you can't count on no one
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world

Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world

Ain't it fun Ain't it fun
Baby, now you're one of us
Ain't it fun Ain't it fun
Ain't it fun

Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world
Ain't it good (Ain't it goo-oo-ood)
Bein' all alone
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world
('Cause the world don't orbit around you)
Ain't it good (Ain't it goo-oo-ood)
Bein' all alone
Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh

Don't go cryin' to your mama (Not to your mama)
'Cause you're on your own in the real world (Don't go cryin')
Don't go cryin' to your mama (To your mama)
'Cause you're on your own in the real world (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Don't go cryin' to your mama (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause you're on your own in the real world (This is the real world)
Don't go cryin' to your mama (Don't go cryin')
'Cause you're on your own in the real world (This is the real world)
Don't go cryin' to your mama (This is the real world, don't go cryin')
'Cause you're on your own in the real world (Oh, oh)
Don't go cryin' to your mama (Don't you cry to your mama)
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' (Don't you go, don't you go cryin')
Don't go cryin' (You're on your own)
Don't go cryin' (Don't go cryin' to your mama)
Don't go cryin' (Don't you cry, don't you cry)

"Part II"

What a shame, what a shame we all remain
Such fragile broken things
A beauty half betrayed
Butterflies with punctured wings
Still there are darkened places deep in my heart
Where once was blazing light, now
There's a tiny spark

Oh glory
Come and find me
Oh glory
Come and find me

Dancing all alone to the sound of an enemy's song
I'll be lost until you find me
Fighting on my own in a war that's already been won
I'll be lost until you come and find me here
Oh glory

Here

What a mess, what a mystery we've made
Of love and other simple things
Learning to forgive even when it wasn't a mistake
I question every human who won't look in my eyes
Scars left on my heart formed patterns in my mind

Oh glory
You will find me

Dancing all alone to the sound of an enemy's song
I'll be lost until you find me
Fighting on my own in a war that's already been won
I'll be lost until you come and find me here
Oh glory

(I'll be lost until)
Like the moon we borrow our light
I am nothing but a shadow in the night
So if you let me I will catch fire
To let your glory and mercy shine

"Last Hope"

I don't even know myself at all
I thought I would be happy by now
The more I try to push it, I realize
Gotta let go of control

Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Just let it happen

It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

Every night I try my best to dream
Tomorrow makes it better
Then I wake up to the cold reality
And not a thing has changed

But it will happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen

It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

And the salt in my wounds
Isn't burning any more than it used to
It's not that I don't feel the pain
It's just I'm not afraid of hurting anymore
And the blood in these veins
Isn't pumping any less than it ever has
And that's the hope I have
The only thing I know that's keeping me alive
Alive

Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen

It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
(So if I let go of control now, I can be strong)
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
(So if I keep my eyes closed, with the blind hope)
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

"Still Into You"

Can't count the years on one hand
That we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better

It's not a walk in the park
To love each other
But when our fingers interlock,
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it
'Cause after all this time I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)

Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time I'm still into you

Recount the night that
I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya

You felt the weight of the world
Fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever
And after all this time I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time I'm still into you

Well, some things just, some things just make sense
And one of those is you and I (Hey)
Some things just, some things just make sense
And even after all this time (Hey)

I'm into you, baby, not a day goes by
That I'm not into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far

'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time
I'm still into you
I'm still into you
I'm still into you

"Anklebiters"

Why do you care what people think
Are you hooked up to their leash
You know anklebiters
Ate up your personality

Try to remember how it felt
To just make up your own steps
And let anklebiters
Chew up, spit out someone else

Fall in love with yourself

Because someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got
Someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got

Why you wanna please the world
And leave yourself to drop dead
Someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got

What do you actually expect
A broken mirror to reflect
You know, anklebiters
Gave you a false perception

And why do I defend
(C'mon, c'mon) your ignorance
Oh, why do I defend
(C'mon, c'mon) the state you're in

You should fall in love
With yourself, oh, again
Fall in love with yourself

Because someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got
Someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got

Why you wanna please the world
And leave yourself to drop dead
Someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got

Anklebiters Anklebiters
Someday you're gonna be alone
Anklebiters Anklebiters

"Interlude Holiday"

(Mmhmm)

Now I can move on to facing
Big girl problems
No more high school drama
Graduated with honors

And I'm drinkin' coffee while I
Read the paper
I've been savin' money, eatin'
Only top ramen

Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Now I get a holiday
Wherever I go I might stay
I don't plan on coming back
Ever if I can help it

Now I get a holiday
I think I'll stay
Holiday, think I'll stay
Now I get a holiday

"Proof"

It's really hard
I can't cry in your arms
'Cause you're not here
It's not your fault
And if it was I wouldn't care

My heart is bigger
Than the distance
In-between us
I know it 'cause I
Feel it beating

So strong it'll knock you down
So strong, so strong

Over here
I can't count the miles away
From where I wanna be
I bet your skin is warm
And that you're smiling

Yeah, that's what I always
Loved the most about you
You're so strong
Come and knock me down, hey

Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am
(Whoa-oh-oh), if I'm a woman with no fear
Just like I claim I am, (whoa-oh-oh)
Then I believe in what you say
There's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you

I'll get in my car
Drive it faster than I
Ever did before
Head out west until I finally
Reach the shore

And then I'll swim out
To wherever you are
And we'll ride the undercurrent
Down to the floor

Making friends with all
The unfamiliar creatures
And pushing back
All the unnecessary pressure
Come up for air just so you
Know we won't drown

You're so strong
The world can't keep us down, hey

Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am
(Whoa-oh-oh), if I'm a woman with no fear
Just like I claim I am, (whoa-oh-oh)
Then I believe in what you say
There's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you

Yeah, ooh, yeah, hey
Yeah, ooh, yeah, hey

So do you love me (Yeah)
All you gotta do is say yes
Now do you love me (Yeah, hey)
And I won't ever second guess

Now do you love me (Yeah)
All you gotta do is say yes
Now do you love me (Yeah, hey)
Then you already proved it

Yeah, yeah, hey

Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am
(Whoa-oh-oh), if I'm a woman with no fear
Just like I claim I am, (whoa-oh-oh)
Then I believe in what you say
There's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is

Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am
(Whoa-oh-oh), if I'm a woman with no fear
Just like I claim I am, (whoa-oh-oh)
Then I believe in what you say
There's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you

"Hate To See Your Heart Break"

There is not a single word in the whole world
That could describe the hurt
The dullest knife just sawing back and forth
And ripping through the softest skin there ever was

How were you to know
Oh, how were you to know

And I, I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before
And I, I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before

Love happens all the time
To people who aren't kind
And heroes who are blind
Expecting perfect scripted movie scenes
Who wants an awkward silent mystery

How were you to know
Well, how were you to know-oh-oh

And I, I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before
And I, I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before

For all the air that's in your lungs
For all the joy that is to come
For all the things that you're alive to feel
Just let the pain remind you hearts can heal

Oh, how were you to know (How were you to know)
Oh, how were you to know

And I, I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before
And I, I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before

"(One Of Those) Crazy Girls"

Now when you say you wanna slow down
Does it mean you wanna slow dance
Maybe you just want a little extra time
To focus on our romance

What do you mean I got it backwards
You know we're gonna be forever
Why are you tellin' me goodbye
Aren't you gonna stay the night

Are we really over now
Maybe I can change your mind
Soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times

Now I walk under a pink sky (ooh)
Lovers float along and pass me by
I pour my heart out to your voice mail
Let you know I caught a bus
To your side of town

And now I'm standing at your doorstep
With Los Angeles behind me
If you don't answer I'll just use the key
That I copied 'cause I really need to see you

If you're not here when I break in
I'm gonna go to your closet
Just so I can smell your skin
As the chemicals swim
I know I'll never love again
I swear I'll never love again

Baby, are we over now
Maybe I can change your mind
As soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times

I'm not one of those crazy girls
I'm not one of those crazy girls
I'm not one of those crazy girls
I'm not one of those crazy girls

Hey, baby, are we over now
Maybe I can change your mind
As soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times

Baby, are we over now
Maybe I can change your mind
Soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Now I'm one of those crazy girls
Now I'm one of those crazy girls
Now I'm one of those crazy girls
Now I'm one of those crazy girls

"Interlude I'm Not Angry Anymore"

I'm not angry anymore
Well, sometimes I am
I don't think badly of you
Well, sometimes I do

It depends on the day
The extent of all my worthless rage
I'm not angry anymore

I'm not bitter anymore
I'm syrupy sweet
I rot your teeth down to their core
If I'm really happy

Depends on the day
If I wake up in a giddy haze
Well, I'm not angry
I'm not totally angry
I'm not all that angry anymore

"Be Alone"

So what if I don't have
A lot to talk about
I shut my mouth and keep it
Locked until it counts

And what if I don't ever want
To leave my house
Stay on the couch while
All my friends are going out

Alone

You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too lonely

I'll make the journey down the hall
Back to my room
And kill more time, and let it rot
Inside its tomb (inside its tomb)

See, I ain't one to climb
Some social ladder too
Some Shangri-La
That all the cool kids will abuse

Alone

You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too lonely

(We could be alone together)

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm a loner, I'm in love with you alone

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Come, be a loner, be in love with me alone

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too lonely

You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too lonely

"Future"

That's how you had it, yeah
Pretty sure

It is. It goes clapping a bit

Something just in that way
Alright, here we go

You go octave down this time

I'm writing the future
I'm writing it out, loud
We don't talk about the past
We don't talk about the past now

So, I'm writing the future
I'm leaving a key here
Something won't always be missing
You won't always feel emptier

Just think of the future
And think of your dreams
You'll get away from here
You'll get away eventually

So, just think of the future
Think of a new life
And don't get lost in the memories
Keep your eyes on a new prize

"Escape Route"

I've got a life out there somewhere
It's waiting
Lined with palm trees and only new faces
If I could look past the present and get there
Well baby, it's worth a shot

Just enough time to plan an escape route
I put my map on the wall in the basement
Not quite a victory to run from your problems
But it's the only plan that I got
It's the only plan that I got

And if you try to find me now

Oh
Oh oh oh

I'm in all the echoes that have faded out
So... I'm moving on
'Cause I just want to feel for once that I belong
That's what's going on
That's what's going on

Crossed the state line and called out a warning
Not too long now, I'll breathe California
Paid my dues and I tried to be loyal
But now I'm done with all that

Where I'm going is everyone's story
We want
You left
And we're left to start over

It's not a question of who are we really
It's who we want to be

And if you try to find me now

Oh
Oh oh

I'm in all the echoes that have faded out
So... I'm moving on
'Cause I just want to feel for once that I belong
And that's what's going on

All that's in between
A brand new life and I is time
But time has not been kind
It's not been kind to me
It's winding backwards

Time has not been kind
It's crawling by
So
Slowly

And if you try to find me now

Oh
Oh oh oh

I'm in all the echoes that have faded out
So... I'm moving on
'Cause I just want to feel for once that I belong
And that's what's going on
And if you try to find me now

Oh
Oh oh oh

I'm in all the echoes that have faded out
So... I'm moving on
'Cause I just want to feel for once that I belong
And that's what's going on

"Native Tongue"

How can they say
That it's one way
When it's the opposite
And how can they know
The end of the story
Before I tell it

'Cause when I walk
Your feet, they fall
To the same beat
Or maybe we're from two different worlds
But we got our own language

We talk to people
But they never understand
They think we're crazy
'Cause it sounds like noise

When we're speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue
We're speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue

We used to live
Like we were strangers
We didn't know any better
We didn't fit
In with the out crowd
So we gave in
And we shut our mouths

But oh I love your history
And I can take it
And when you talk in code to me
I can translate it
We talk to people
But they never understand

They think we're crazy
'Cause it sounds like noise to them
Ain't it strange
All the things you hear
When you sit
And listen

We're speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue
We're speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue

And all this time I've been wasting my breath
Just wasting my words on everyone else

Now I'm speaking in my native
Speaking in my native tongue

So come on
Talk it out
So come on
Talk it out
So come on
And talk talk talk talk talk -
Talk it out
(Your voice, it brought me back from the dead, somehow)
So come on and
Talk talk talk talk talk
Talk it out

OUT

OUT

OUT

Speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue
We're speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue

(You know we speak in my native aoohh)
And all this time I've been wasting my breath
Just wasting my words on everyone else
(You know we speak in my native aoohh)
Now speaking in my native
Speaking in my native tongue

"Tell Me It's Okay"

Maybe it's been years since I genuinely smiled
And maybe it's been years since I wanted to be a part of anything

But lately I've been good
You know, I've actually been great
Man, I even laughed a little today

Oh, it's so strange
It's so strange

Tell me it's okay to be happy now
because I'm happy now
Tell me it's okay to be happy now
because I'm happy now

Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay

I thought it was my right to be as sorry as I wanted to be
I wasted all my teenage years being a misery factory

But something had to give
I had to finally see the light
I think at 23 it's time to practice what I preach
And what I preach is...

Tell me it's okay to be happy now
because I'm happy now
Tell me it's okay to be happy now
because I'm happy now

Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay

All my wasted hope
I let go when I should've held tighter
And now when the sun is out
I let it burn
Not afraid to feel it shine on me

Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay

Tell me it's okay to be happy now
because I'm happy now
Tell me it's okay to be happy now
My life is finally leveling out so

Tell me it's okay to be happy now
because I'm happy now
Tell me it's okay to be happy now
My life is finally leveling out so

Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay

"Hard Times"

All that I want
Is to wake up fine
Tell me that I'm alright
That I ain't gonna die
All that I want
Is a hole in the ground
You can tell me when it's alright
For me to come out

Hard times
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times
Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
These lives
And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times
Hard times

And I gotta get to rock bottom

Walking around
With my little rain cloud
Hanging over my head
And it ain't coming down
Where do I go
Gimme some sort of sign
You hit me with lightning
Maybe I'll come alive

Hard times
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times
Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
These lives
And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times
Hard times

And I gotta hit rock bottom

Tell my friends I'm coming down
We'll kick it when I hit the ground
Tell my friends I'm coming down
We'll kick it when I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground

Hard times
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times
Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
These lives
And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times (hard times)
Hard times (hard times)

Hard times
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times
Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
These lives
And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times (hard times)
Hard times

(Makes you wonder why you even try
Makes you wonder why you even try
Makes you wonder why you even try
Makes you wonder sometimes)

(Still don't know how I even survive
Still don't know how I even survive
Still don't know how I even survive
Still don't know how I survive)

And I gotta get to rock bottom

"Rose-Colored Boy"

Low-key, no pressure, just hang with me and my weather
Low-key, no pressure, just hang with me and my weather

Rose-colored boy
I hear you making all that noise
About the world you want to see
And oh, I'm so annoyed
'Cause I just killed off what was left of the optimist in me

Hearts are breaking, wars are raging on
And I have taken my glasses off
You got me nervous
I'm right at the end of my rope
A half-empty girl
Don't make me laugh, I'll choke

Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy

Low-key, no pressure, just hang with me and my weather

And I want you to stop insisting that I'm not a lost cause
'Cause I've been through a lot
Really all I've got is just to stay pissed off
If it's alright by you

But hearts are breaking, and wars are raging on
And I have taken my glasses off
You got me nervous
When you're turning it into a joke
A half-empty girl
Don't make me laugh, I'll...

Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey, man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy

Leave me here a little bit longer
I think I wanna stay in the car
I don't want anybody seeing me cry now
You say "We gotta look on the bright side"
I say "Well maybe if you wanna go blind"
You say my eyes are getting too dark now
But boy, you ain't ever seen my mind

Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey, man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy
Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
I know we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy

Low-key, no pressure, just hang with me and my weather
Low-key, no pressure, just hang with me and my weather

"Told You So"

For all I know
The best is over and the worst is yet to come
Is it enough
To keep on hoping when the rest have given up
And they go

I hate to say I told you so
But they love to say they told me so
I hate to say I told you so
But they love to say they told me

Say they say they told me
Say they say they told me
You say, you say you told me

I know you like
When I admit that I was wrong and you were right
At least I try
To keep my cool when I am thrown into a fire
And they go

I hate to say I told you so
But they love to say they told me so
I hate to say I told you so
But they love to say they told me

Say they say they told me
Say they say they told me
You say, you say you told me

Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again

Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again

I hate to say I told you so
But they love to say they told me so
I hate to say I told you so
But they love to say they told me

(Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again)
Say they say they told me
(Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again)
Say they say they told me
(Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again)
You say, you say you told me
Say they told me, say they told me, told you so

"Forgiveness"

You hurt me bad this time, no coming back
And I cried till I couldn't cry, another heart attack
If I lay on the floor, maybe I'll wake up
And I don't pick up when you call
'Cause your voice is a gun
Every word is a bullet hole
Shot a hole in the sun
If I never look up maybe I'll never notice

And you, you want forgiveness
But I, I just can't do it yet

There's still a thread that runs from your body to mine
And you can't break what you don't see, an invisible line
If I follow it down will we just be alright
But it could take me all your life to learn to love
How I thought I could love someone
I haven't even begun
If it's all up to us we might as well give up

And you, you want forgiveness
(I can barely hang on to myself)
But I, I can't give you that
(I can't give you, I can't give you that)
And you, you want forgiveness
(I'm afraid that I'll have nothing left)
But I, I just can't do it yet
(I can't do, I just can't do it yet)

Don't you go and get it twisted
Forgiving is not forgetting
Don't you go and get it twisted
Forgiving is not forgetting
No, it's not forgetting
No, I'll never forget it, no

And you, you want forgiveness
(I can barely hang on to myself)
But I, I can't give you that
(I can't give you, I can't give you that)
And you, you want forgiveness
(I'm afraid that I'll have nothing left)
But I, I just can't do it yet
(I can't do, I just can't do it yet)

"Fake Happy"

I love making you believe
What you get is what you see
But I'm so fake happy
I feel so fake happy
And I bet everybody here
Is just as insincere
We're all so fake happy
And I know fake happy

So I've been doing a good job of makin' 'em think
I'm quite alright, better hope I don't blink
You see it's easy when I'm stomping on a beat
But no one sees me when I crawl back underneath

If I smile with my teeth
Bet you believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I believe me

Oh please don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh what's the use
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too

And if I go out tonight, dress up my fears
You think I look alright with these mascara tears
See I'm gonna draw up my lipstick wider than my mouth
And if the lights are low they'll never see me frown

If I smile with my teeth
Bet you believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I believe me

Oh please don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh oh what's the use
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too

I know I said that I was doing good and that I'm happy now
I should've known when things were going good that's when I'd get knocked down

Oh please, just don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh no, oh what's the use
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too

(Oh please)
(Oh please)

Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too

(Carlos...)

"26"

Man, you really know how to get someone down
Everything was fine until you came around
I've been chasing after dreamers in the clouds
After all wasn't I the one who said
To keep your feet on the ground
Man, you really brought me back down

Hold on to hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
They say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

You got me tied up but I stay close to the window
And I talk to myself about the places that I used to go
I'm hoping someday maybe I'll just float away
And I'll forget every cynical thing you say
When you gonna hear me out
Man, you really bring me down

Hold on to hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
They say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

Reality will break your heart
Survival will not be the hardest part
It's keeping all your hopes alive
When all the rest of you has died
So let it break your heart

And hold on to hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody

Hold on to hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
They say that dreaming is free
I wouldn't care what it cost me

"Pool"

As if the first cut wasn't deep enough
I dove in again cause I'm not into giving up
Coulda got the same rush from any lover's touch
But why get used to something new
'Cause no one breaks my heart like you

When you kiss me I wish we could see what happens next
For a moment I could forget what happens in my head
If I doubt you will you come through, happy second chance
Or happy ending
This time you don't leave me sinking

I'm under water
No air in my lungs
My eyes are open
And I'm giving up
You are the wave
I could never tame
If I survive I'll dive back in

As if the first blood didn't thrill enough
I went further out to see what else was left of us
Never found the deep end of our little ocean
Drain the fantasy of you headfirst into shallow pools

And I wonder is it better to get it over with
The illusion can shatter before we begin
If you're really sorry, happy second chance
I think I could forgive
This time you won't leave me sinking

I'm under water
No air in my lungs
My eyes are open
And I'm giving up
You are the wave
I could never tame
If I survive I'll dive back in

Dive back into
Right back into
Dive right back into you
Now I know you
Now I know you
Now that I know you
Dive right back into you

Back into
Right back into you
Dive right back into you
Now I know you
Now I know you
Now that I know you
Dive right back into you

I'm under water
No air in my lungs
My eyes are open
And I'm giving up
You are the wave
I could never tame
If I survive I'll dive back in

I'm under water
No air in my lungs
My eyes are open
And I'm giving up
You are the wave
I could never tame
If I survive I'll dive back in
I'll dive back in
I'll dive back

"Grudges"

Strange how we found ourselves exactly where we left off
I know you're shaking my hand like it is the first time
Are we alright
Are you recounting all my faults
And are you racking your brain just to find them all
Could it be that I've changed or did you

Stop asking why
Why we had to waste so much time
Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again
'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges

Time is a bastard I won't break my neck to get around it
But aren't we so brave to give up a fight
And let the years go by without us
'Cause now I feel you by my side
And I don't even care if it's been a while
I can feel that we've changed and we're better this way

Stop asking why
Why we had to waste so much time
Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again
'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges

And if you wanna call me up or come over
Come on, we'll laugh 'till we cry
Like we did when we were kids
'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges

Why did it take so long
Why did it take so long
Why did it take us so long to just let it go
Why did it take us so long to stop holding on

Stop asking why
Why we had to waste so much time
Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again
'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges

And if you wanna call me up or come over
Come on we'll laugh till we cry
Like we did when we were kids
'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges

We can't keep holding on to grudges
Could it be that I've changed
Could it be that I've changed
Could it be that I've changed
Could it be that I've changed or did you

"Caught In The Middle"

I can't think of getting old
It only makes me want to die
And I can't think of who I was
'Cause it just makes me want to cry, cry, cry, cry
Can't look back, can't look too far ahead
I got the point, I got the message

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
Gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah I'm caught in the middle

I was dreaming life away
All the while just going blind
Can't see the forest for the trees
Behind the lids of my own eyes
Nostalgia's cool, but it won't help you now
A dream is good, if you don't wear it out

And I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
Gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah I'm caught in the middle

No, I don't need no help
I can sabotage me by myself
Don't need no one else
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no help
I can sabotage me by myself
Don't need no one else
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no help (all the glory days are gone)
I can sabotage me by myself
Don't need no one else (it's over now I'm on my own)
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no help (all the glory days are gone)
I can sabotage me by myself
Don't need no one else (it's over now I'm on my own)
I can sabotage me by myself

And I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
Gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah I'm caught in the middle

I'm caught in the middle

"Idle Worship"

Standing here like I'm supposed to say something
Don't hold your breath, I never said I'd save you, honey
And I don't want your money
If I was you I'd run from me or rip me open
You'll see you're not the only one who's hopeless
Be sure to put your faith in something more
I'm just a girl and you're not as alone as you feel
We all got problems, don't we
We all need heroes, don't we
But rest assured there's not a single person here who's worthy

Don't let me let you down

Hey, baby I'm not your superhuman
And if that's what you want
I hate to let you down
I got your hopes up
Now I got you hoping
But I'm gonna be the one to let you down

Oh, it's such a long and awful lonely fall
Down from this pedestal that you keep putting me on
What if I fall on my face
What if I make a mistake
If it's okay a little grace would be appreciated
Remember how we used to like ourselves
What little light that's left, we need to keep it sacred
I know that you're afraid to let all the dark escape you
But we could let the light illuminate these hopeless places

Just let me let you down

Hey, baby I'm not your superhuman
And if that's what you want
I hate to let you down
I got your hopes up
Now I got you hoping
But I'm gonna be the one to let you down

Oh, no, I ain't your hero
You're wasting all your faith on me
Oh, no, I know where this goes
Think it's safe to say your savior doesn't look a thing like me

Don't let me let you down

Hey, baby I'm not your superhuman
And if that's what you want
I hate to let you down
I got your hopes up
Now I got you hoping
But I'm gonna be the one to let you down

Hey, baby I'm not your superhuman
And if that's what you want
I hate to let you down
I got your hopes up
Now I got you hoping
But I'm gonna be the one to let you down

"No Friend"
(feat. Aaron Weiss)

I found these old letters from years ago
I felt it was fitting to continue this correspondence
Can't help I'm sentimental
Thanks for talking with me today
Hope this is helpful for you
I also hope Birdie is happy and healthy
And staying out of trouble to a reasonable extent
What I wrote was sort of my way
Of finally being able to address how it feels

Another brick-red room, another black-top town
Another misspelled band burning their own houses down
Another pine-box tune to fill the cemetery day
Another star, a touch of orange over purgatory gray

Another thorny field to scatter fruitless seed
Another song that runs too long, God knows no one needs
More misguided ghosts, more transparent hands
To drop a nickel in our basket and we'll do our riot

Dance beneath another burning sky, behind our painted lips
In scores of catatonic smile-covered ankle-bitten ships
So throw your pedestal of stone in the forgetful sea
As protection from the paper-thin perfection you project on me

When this repetition ends behind the window shades
A semi-conscious sorrow sleeping in the bed I've made
That most unrestful bed, that most original of sins
And you'll say that's what I get when I let ambition win again

I'd hate to let you down, so I'll let the waters rise
And drown my dull reflection in the nave expectation in your eyes
Back in a cast bit-part, back when I felt most free
I had a butcher's heart and no one thought they knew me

So before the regiment resumes, before the dreaded sun appears
My driver's waiting, so let's make one point crystal clear
You see a flood-lit form, I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours, and you're no friend of mine

You're no friend of mine, you're no friend of mine
I'm no savior of yours, and you're no friend of mine
You see a flood-lit form, I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours, and you're no friend of mine

It's kind of hard to see myself in the reflection of people's eyes
Realizing what they see may not be even close to the image I see in myself
And I hate I might actually be more afraid
To let my own self down than anything else
I feel like the man in the story
Who saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat
Twelve years ago I stood on the shore
Jumped in and grabbed the coat
And the river is rushing toward a waterfall
And my friend stood at the shore and shouted to let go of the coat and swim back to land
I let go of the coat but the coat won't let go of me
In any case please let me know if there's more I can give you
If nothing comes of it, then just know we are grateful

"Tell Me How"

I can't call you a stranger
But I can't call you
I know you think that I erased you
You may hate me, but I can't hate you
And I won't replace you

Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh oh oh oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go

Think I'm tired of getting over it
And just starting something new again
I'm getting sick of the beginnings
And always coming to your defenses
I guess it's good to get it off my chest
I guess I can't believe I haven't yet
You know I got my own convictions
And they're stronger than any addiction
But no one's winning

Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh oh oh oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go
Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh oh oh oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go

Keep me up with your silence
Take me down with your quiet
Of all the weapons you fight with
Your silence is the most violent

Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh oh oh oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go
Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh oh oh oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go

You don't have to tell me
If you ever think of me
I know you see me dancing
Wildly in the fog of your memory
You don't have to tell me
I can still believe

"This Is Why"

If you have an opinion
Maybe you should shove it
Or maybe you could scream it
Might be best to keep it

To yourself (To yourself)
To yourself (To yourself)

This is why
I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear
But you won't catch me out
Oh, why
This is why

Better have conviction
'Cause we want crimes of passion
Survival of the fittest
You're either with us or you can keep it

To yourself (To yourself)
To yourself (To yourself)
To yourself, yourself, yourself

This is why
I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear
But you won't catch me out
Oh, why
This is why

This is why
I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear
But you won't catch me out
Oh, why
This is why

One step beyond your door
It might as well have been a free fall
One step beyond your door
Falling down an endless hall
One step beyond your door
Might as well have been a free fall
One step beyond your door
And I'm floating like a cannonball

This is why
I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear
But you won't catch me out
Oh, why
This is why

Ah, ah, this is why
I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear
But oh, no, you won't catch me out
Oh, why
This is why

"The News"

War
A war
A war
On the far side
On the other side of the planet

And I've got
War
A war
A war
Right behind my eyes
Right behind 'em just like a headache

So I turn on the news
Turn off the news

Every second our collective heart breaks
All together every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off, the news

Every second our collective heart breaks
All together every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off, the news

Far
I'm far
So far
From a front line
Quite the opposite I'm safe inside

But I worry and I give money
And I feel useless behind this computer
And that's just barely scratched the surface of my mind

So I turn on the news
Turn off the news
Turn on the news
Turn off the news

Every second our collective heart breaks
All together every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off, the news

Every second our collective heart breaks
All together every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off, the news

Exploitative
Performative
Informative
And we don't know the half of it
Rhetorical
Deplorable
Historical
And all along we called it normal

"Running Out Of Time"

Said I was gonna take some flowers to my neighbor, but I
Ran out of time
Didn't wanna show up to the party empty-handed, but I
Ran out of time
Said I'd walk the dog a little further than the driveway tonight
The extra mile
Thought I'd send a card with my condolences, but, damn, I
Just ran out of time

Intentions only get you so far
What if I'm just a selfish prick No regard

I, I'm always running out of time
I'm always running out of time

Never mind, I hit the snooze on my alarm twenty times
But I was just so tired
There was traffic, spilled my coffee, crashed my car, otherwise
Woulda been here on time
Shoulda, coulda, wouldn't matter, ultimate alibi
You know it's a lie
There was a fire (Metaphorically)
Be there in five (Hyperbolically)

Intentions only get you so far (It was on my list, I swear I meant to get to it)
A harsh reality to discover

I, I'm always running out of time
She's always running out of time
I'm always running out of time

Why we gotta be in a rush
My watch is just for decoration (Mm)
Look, I showed up early for once
Now that's a new sensation (Mm)

We're always running out of time
She's always running out of time
I'm always running out of time
I'm always running out of time
She's always running out of time, out of time
I'm always running out of time

"C'est Comme a"

C'est comme a, c'est comme a, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
C'est comme a, c'est comme a, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
C'est comme a, c'est comme a, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
C'est comme a, c'est comme a, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

In a single year, I've aged one hundred
My social life, a chiropractic appointment
Sit still long enough to listen to yourself
Or maybe just long enough for you to atrophy to hell

C'est comme a, c'est comme a, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
C'est comme a, c'est comme a, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

I'm off caffeine on doctor's orders
Said it was gonna help to level out my hormones
Lucky for me, I run on spite and sweet revenge
It's my dependence on the friction that really hinders my progression

I know that regression is rarely rewarded
I still need a certain degree of disorder

C'est comme a, c'est comme a, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
C'est comme a, c'est comme a, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
C'est comme a, c'est comme a, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
C'est comme a, c'est comme a, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

I know that regression is rarely rewarded
I still need a certain degree of disorder
I hate to admit getting better is boring
But the high cost of chaos, who can afford it

C'est comme a, c'est comme a, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
C'est comme a, c'est comme a, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

"Big Man, Little Dignity"

Don't mean to stare at you from across the room
It's like I'm glued to the sheer sight of you
And you're so smooth, it's pitiful
Know you could get away with anything
So that's exactly what you do

Big man, little dignity (Ooh-ooh)
Big man, little dignity (Ooh-ooh)
No offense but you
You got no integrity
Big man (Ooh)
Ooh, la-la-la little dignity

Well-well-well-well look at you
Don't you clean up nice
Bet it feels good to leave the past behind
Your subscription to redemption has been renewed
You keep your head high
Smooth operator in a shit-stained suit

Big man, little dignity (Ooh-ooh)
Big man, little dignity (Ooh-ooh)
No offense but you
You got no integrity
Big man (Ooh)
Ooh, la-la-la little dignity

Oh, I can't look away

I memorized all your lies
I can't look away, you're like a movie that I love to hate
I fantasize your demise
I should look away because I know you're never gonna change
I keep thinking
This time the end will be different
But it isn't
I keep thinking (Keep thinking)
The end is gonna be different
But you keep on winning

Big man, little dignity (Ooh-ooh)
Big man, little dignity (Ooh-ooh)
No offense, but you
You got no integrity
Big man (Ooh)
Ooh, la-la-la little dignity

"You First"

Living well is not my kind of revenge
You should take it from me
Living well is just a privilege
Thought I'd simmer down as I got older
Can't shake the devil sitting on my shoulder
Who invited you

Just like a stray animal
I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy
And it keeps on coming back
Just like a stray animal
I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy
And it keeps on coming

Everyone is a bad guy
And there's no way, no way to know who's the worst
Karma's gonna come for all of us
And I hope, I hope, I just hope, she comes, comes for you first, oh

Which wolf wins
I guess it really depends
Just gotta wait and see
Which one's appetite's the biggest
Turns out I'm living in a horror film
Where I'm both the killer and the final girl
So who, who are you

Just like a stray animal
I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy
And it keeps on coming back
Just like a stray animal
I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy
And it keeps on coming

Everyone is a bad guy
And there's no way, no way to know who's the worst
Karma's gonna come for all of us
And I hope, I hope, I just hope, she comes, comes for you first, oh

Never said I wasn't petty
Never said I wasn't petty

I never said I wasn't petty
You can bet I don't regret it for a second
It's a pleasure, it's a reckoning
Never said I wasn't petty
I'll do better when you're better
Let me revel in your defeat

Everyone is a bad guy
And there's no way, no way to know who's the worst
Karma's gonna come for all of us
And I hope, I hope, I just hope, she comes, comes for you first, oh

"Figure 8"

Drained me dry
Down to the last drop
Pearls before swine
All flowers die
Tapped the last good vein
Don't know how to shut it off

Yeah, once you get me going
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
Once you get me going
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to

All for your sake
Became the very thing that I hate
I lost my way
Spinning in an endless figure 8

I
Won't miss the feeling
My flimsy spine
Unsuspicious mind
I was only being kind
But you mistook me for weak

And once I get going
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
Going
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to

All for your sake
Became the very thing that I hate
I lost my way
Spinning in an endless figure 8

Candle light
Candle light
Burning 'til broad daylight
Candle light
Candle light
Burning at both ends tonight

How could I
How could I
If I'm made of thin ice
How could I
How could I
You'd be wise if you thought twice

All for your sake
Became the very thing that I hate
I lost my way
Spinning in an endless figure

What remains
And now I think I'm losing my shape
Not a trace
No end and no beginning, figure 8

"Liar"

What was the moment It's hard to say
I'm sure I don't remember anyway
Before I only knew to hesitate
Pin back in the grenade
And all the ways I'd keep you safe
I keep you safe
From me

And, oh my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth

I got too good at fighting chemicals
And dodging arrows I was asking for
Wading through the fog, and then it disappeared
Naked when I'm here
And why should I deny what's all at once so crystal clear
(And why should I deny what's all at once so crystal clear)

And, oh my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth

Love is not an easy thing to admit
But I'm not ashamed of it
Love is not a weakening
If you feel it rushing in
Don't be ashamed of it

Love is not an easy thing to admit
But I'm not ashamed of it
Love is not a weakening
If you feel it rushing in
Don't be ashamed of it

And, oh my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth

And, oh my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth

"Crave"

I can't wait to memorize this day
Oh, a picture could not contain
The way it feels
You say, "Live in the present."
I'm already dreaming of how it begins
And trying to savor the moment
But I know the feeling will come to an end

So I
Crave
Crave to do it again
All again
Crave
Crave to do it again, I
Just for a second it all felt simple
I'm already missing it
So I
Crave
Crave to do it again
All again

I romanticize even the worst of times
When all it took to make me cry
Was being alive
Look up and see a reflection of someone who never gave way to the pain
What if I told 'em, now that I'm older, there isn't a moment that I'd wanna change

Now I
Crave
Crave to do it again
All again
Crave
Crave to do it again, I
Just for a second it all felt simple
I'm already missing it
So I crave
Crave to do it again
All again

Any second
Feel the present
Future and the past
Connecting

Any second
Feel the present
Future and the past
Connecting

Crave
Crave, to do it again (Do it)
All again
Crave
Crave to do it again, I
Just for a second it all felt simple
I'm already missing it
So I crave
Crave to do it again
All again

"Thick Skull"

I am a magnet for broken pieces
I am attracted to broken people
I pick 'em up, and now my fingers are bleeding
And it looks like my fault
And it looks like I'm caught
Red-handed

Hit over the head
Epiphany
Over my head
Repeatedly
Thick skull never did
Nothing for me
Same lesson again
Come on, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

Only I know where all the bodies are buried
Thought by now I'd find 'em just a little less scary
Might get easier, but you don't get used to it
Keep on autopilot, mmm
Hey, hey
What's the body count up to now, captain

Hit over the head
Epiphany
Over my head
Repeatedly
Thick skull never did
Nothing for me
Same lesson again
C'mon, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

Come on out with your hands up
Come on out with your hands up
I'm coming out with my hands up, mmm
Come on out with your hands up

Hit over the head
Epiphany
Over my head
Repeatedly
Thick skull never did
Nothing for me
Same lesson again
C'mon, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

I pick 'em up and now my fingers are bleeding
And it looks like I'm caught
Red-handed

"The News (Re The Linda Lindas)"

A war

War
A war
A war
On the far side
On the other side of the planet

And I've got
War
A war
A war
Right behind my eyes
Right behind 'em just like a headache

So I turn on
The news
Turn off
The news

Every second our collective heart breaks
All together every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off the news

Every second our collective heart breaks
All together every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off the news

Far
I'm far
So far
From a frontline
Quite the opposite, I'm safe inside

But I worry and I give money
And I feel useless behind this computer
And that's just barely scratched the surface of my mind

So I turn on
The news
Turn off
Turn on, turn off the news
Turn on
The news
Turn off

Every second our collective heart breaks
All together every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off the news

Every second our collective heart breaks
All together every single head shakes
Shut your eyes, but it won't go away
Turn on, turn off the news

"Running Out Of Time (Re Panda Bear)"

(Mm) Time's up again
I'm plannin' the getaway
Or grindin' the life away
I can't tell
I wanna say
I'm throwin' another die
Or hopin' to nullify
I can't tell (Mm)

I'm always runnin' outta time

I'm not the lucky one, I keep to myself
Then wish for better, I can't tell

(Mm) Every now and then
Can't hide it, I'm turnin' up
Sidesteppin' the truth somewhat
I can't tell
I know it's meant
Can't tell if I've had enough
If I'm givin' or givin' up
I can't tell (Mm)

I'm always runnin' outta time

I'm not the lucky one, I keep to myself
Then wish for better, just can't tell (Mm)
I got a mystery I keep to myself
Put it together 'cause I can't tell

Time's up again
I'm plannin' the getaway
Or grindin' the life away
I can't tell
A secret I can't tell
I can't tell
A secret I can't tell
Think I feel a fracture in the mirror, just can't tell
And I got a feelin' it's unlockin', now I've fell
Always runnin' out of time
Think I feel a fracture in the mirror, just can't tell
And I got a feelin' it's unlockin', now I've fell
I can't tell

Mm

"Running Out Of Time (Re ane Lowe)"

I'm always running out of time
I'm always running out of time
We're always running out of

"C'est Comme a (Re Wet Leg)"

In a single year
I've aged a hundred
My social life, a chiropractic appointment
Sit still long enough just to listen to yourself
Or maybe just long enough for you to atrophy to hell

On doctor's orders

Lucky for me, I run on spite and sweet revenge
It's my dependence on the friction that really hinders my progression

"Big Man, Little Dignity (Re DOMi & JD BECK)"

Don't mean to stare at you from across the room
It's like I'm glued to the sheer sight of you
And you're so smooth, it's pitiful
Know you could get away with anything, so that's exactly what you do

Big man, ooh-ooh
Little dignity
Big man, ooh-ooh
Little dignity
No offense but you
You got no integrity
Big man, ooh-ooh
Ooh, la-la-la, little dignity

Well-well-well, look at you
Don't you clean up nice
Bet it feels good to leave the past behind
Your subscription to redemption has been renewed
You keep your head high
Smooth operator in a shit-stained suit

Big man, ooh-ooh
Little dignity
Big man, ooh-ooh
Little dignity
No offense but you
You got no integrity
Big man, ooh-ooh
Ooh, la-la-la, little dignity

Oh, I can't look away
I memorized all your lines
I can't look away, you're like a movie that I love to hate
I fantasize your demise
I should look away because I know you're never gonna change
I keep thinking this time the end will be different
But it isn't
I keep thinking
The end is gonna be different
But you keep on winning

Big man, ooh-ooh

No offense, but you
You got no integrity

"You First (Re Remi Wolf)"

Two, three, four

Everyone is bad
So why are you a pacifist
You should take it from me
Yeah, you should be full of it
Yeah, you said it with your chest now, baby
Now I'm living in a horror film
I'm the devil, I'ma break you down, slow life holdin'
Dents in the walls, you saw me coming, guess not

Just like a stray animal you keep feeding scraps
You're gonna give me your energy
Oh-oh-oh
And I'ma keep on coming back
Just like a stray animal you keep feeding scraps
You're gonna give me your energy
Oh-oh-oh
And I'ma keep on coming

Everyone is a bad guy
And there's no way, no way to know who's the worst
But karma's gonna come for all of us
And I hope, yeah, I hope, I just hope
She comes, comes for you first, oh
Oh, comes for you first, oh
Oh, comes for-

I hit you with a stick
Gonna hit you with a tide of bricks
I'm at the foot of your bed
Waiting for you to throw a fist
Which wolf will win now, baby
Guess we're gonna have to wait and see
I like it when you're pissed off, fucked up in the head
It makes me feel a little less crazy, oh

Just like a stray animal you keep feeding scraps
You're gonna give me your energy
Oh-oh-oh
And I'ma keep on coming back
Just like a stray animal you keep feeding scraps
You're gonna give me your energy
Oh-oh-oh

"Figure 8 (Re Bartees Strange)"

Yeah, once you get me going
Yeah, once you get me going
Yeah, once you get me going
Yeah, once you get me
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to

Yeah, once you get me going
Drained me dry
Down to the last drop
Yeah, once you get me going
Pearls before swine, all flowers die
Tapped the last good vein, don't know how to shut it off

Yeah, once you get me going
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
Yeah, once you get me going
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to

All for your sake
Became the very thing that I hate
I lost my way
Spinning in an endless figure 8
Yeah, once you get me going
Yeah, once you get me-

I
Won't miss the feeling
My flimsy spine
Unsuspicious mind
I was only being kind
But you mistook me for weak

And once I get going
Mmm-hmm
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
Going
Ooh, yeah
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to

All for your sake
Became the very thing that I hate
I lost my way
Spinning in an endless figure

All for your sake
Became the very thing I hate
I lost my way
Ending in this figure 8
All for your sake
Became the very thing I hate
I lost my way
Spinning in a figure 8

"Liar (Re Romy)"

Love is not an easy thing to admit
But I'm not ashamed of it
Love is not a weakening
If you feel it rushing in
Don't be ashamed of it
Love is not an easy thing to admit
But I'm not ashamed of it
Love is not a weakening
If you feel it rushing in
Don't be ashamed of it

What was the moment It's hard to say
I'm sure I don't remember anyway
Before I only knew to hesitate
Pin back in the grenade
Does a light show up on my face
Does it feel right in the wrong way
What if I loved you and never said it
Hide the emotion under the bed, would all
The energy I waste
Be better shared with you

And, oh my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth

I got too good at fighting chemicals
And dodging arrows I was asking for
Wading through the fog, and then it disappeared
Naked when I'm here
I'm getting good at giving alibis
Imagination runs wild
No fear and self-doubt
Heart beating in my mouth
Now every time I catch my line
I want to set it free

Love is not an easy thing to admit
But I'm not ashamed of it
Love is not a weakening
If you feel it rushing in
Don't be ashamed of it

Oh, oh-oh
Love is not an easy thing to admit
But I'm not ashamed of it
Oh, oh-oh
Love is not a weakening
If you feel it rushing in
Don't be ashamed of it

And, oh my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth

"Crave (Re Claud)"

I can't wait to memorize this day
Oh, a picture could not contain
The way it feels
You say, "Live in the present"
I'm already dreaming of how it begins
And trying to savor the moment
But I know the feeling will come to an end

So I
Crave
Crave to do it again
All again
Crave
Crave to do it again, I
Just for a second, it all felt simple
I'm already missing it
So I
Crave
Crave to do it again
All again

I romanticize even the worst of times
When all it took to make me cry
Was being alive
Look up and see a reflection of someone who never gave way to the pain
What if I told 'em that now that I'm older, there isn't a moment that I'd wanna change

Now I
Crave
Crave to do it again
All again
Crave
Crave to do it again, I
Just for a second, it all felt simple
I'm already missing it
So I crave
Crave to do it again
All again

Any second
Feel the present
Future and the past
Connecting

Any second
Feel the present
Future and the past
Connecting

Crave
Crave, to do it again
All again
Crave
Crave to do it again, I
Just for a second, it all felt simple
I'm already missing it
So I crave
Crave to do it again
All again

"Thick Skull (Re Julien Baker)"

I am a magnet for broken pieces
I am attracted to broken people
I pick 'em up and now my fingers are bleeding
And it looks like I'm
And it looks like I'm caught
Red-handed

Hit over the head
Epiphany
Over my head
Repeatedly
Thick skull never did
Nothing for me
Same lesson again
Come on, give it to me

Only I know where all the bodies are buried
Thought by now I'd find 'em just a little less scary
Might get easier, but you don't get used to it
Keep on autopilot
What's the body count up to now, captain

Hit over the head
Epiphany
Over my head
Repeatedly
Thick skull never did
Nothing for me
Same lesson again
Come on, give it to me

I pick 'em up and now my fingers are bleeding
And it looks like I'm caught
Red-handed

Come on out with your hands up
Come on out with your hands up
I'm coming out with my hands up
Coming out with your hands up

Hit over the head
Epiphany
Over my head
Repeatedly
Thick skull never did
Nothing for me
Same lesson again
Come on, give it to me

"Sanity (Demo)"

Sanity, why must you make a fool of me
You been a friend to me, now I think that we're enemies, yeah, yeah

If I fall on my knees, I hear you laughin'
If I call on your name, you don't come

No one home, but the void is loud
This must be the void
Echoes around my empty house
This must be the void
Synapses are slowin' down
But this must be the void they always talk about
This must be the void

Levity, fill me up, let me flow
I'll let you take care of me, you can help me let go

If I fall on my knees, I hear you laughin'
If I call on your name, you don't come

No one home, but the void is loud
This must be the void
Echoes around my empty house
This must be the void
Synapses are slowin' down
But this must be the void they always talk about
No one home, but the void is loud
This must be the void
Echoes around my empty house
This must be the void
Synapses are slowin' down
But this must be the void they always talk about
This must be the void

Finally, I have arrived
Finally, I have arrived
And there is nothin' to see
Finally, I have arrived
And there is nothin' to grieve
Finally, I have arrived, arrived, arrived, 'rived

No one home, but the void is loud
This must be the void
Echoes around my empty house
This must be the void
Synapses are slowin' down
But this must be the void they always talk about
This must be the void
No one home, but the void is loud
This must be the void
Echoes around my empty house
This must be the void
Synapses are slowin' down
But this must be the void they always talk about
This must be the void

"Adore"

I don't mean to run
But every time you come around I feel
More alive, than ever
And I guess it's too much
Maybe we're too young
And I don't even know what's real
But I know I've never wanted anything so bad
I've never wanted anyone so bad

If I let you love me
Be the one adored
Would you go all the way
Be the one I'm looking for
If I let you love me, (If I say,)
Be the one adored, (It's okay,)
Would you go all the way (Stay,)
Be the one I'm looking for

Help me come back down
From high above the clouds
You know I'm suffocating
But I blame this town
Why do I deny
The things that burn inside
Down deep I'm barely breathing
But you just see a smile
And I don't wanna let this go
Really, I just want to know

If I let you love me
Be the one adored
Would you go all the way
Be the one I'm looking for
If I let you love me, (If I say,)
Be the one adored, (It's okay,)
Would you go all the way (Stay,)
Be the one I'm looking for

If I let you love me
Be the one adored
Would you go all the way
Be the one I'm looking for

If I let you love me
Be the one adored
Would you go all the way
Be the one I'm looking for
If I let you love me, (If I say,)
Be the one adored, (It's okay,)
Would you go all the way (Stay,)
Be the one I'm looking for

"Another Day"

And if you're listening, I miss you
And if you hear me now, I need you

Where did you go
'Cause you're not gone
Everyone knows that something's wrong
The wires were cut and I'm alone

I know we're getting closer
I know you're coming back for me this time
This time

And do you ever want me, do you ever need me
I know that you left before goodbye
And it's okay, there's always another day
And anytime you want me, anytime you see me
I don't think you meant to say goodbye
But it's okay, there's always another day

Your voice comes in and now it's fading
I can't believe this is so frustrating
'Cause you never seem to understand
And you let me slip straight through your hands
And how does it feel to be alone

I know we're getting closer
I know you're coming back for me this time
This time

And do you ever want me, do you ever need me
I know that you left before goodbye
And it's okay, there's always another day
And anytime you want me, anytime you see me
I don't think you meant to say goodbye
And it's okay, there's always another day

If you ever find what you were looking for
I will be waiting there, I will be there

And do you ever want me, do you ever need me
I know that you left before goodbye
And it's okay, there's always another day
And anytime you want me, anytime you see me
I don't think you meant to say goodbye
But it's okay, there's always another day

"Brand New Eyes Tour Intro"
(Live)

So your father told you once
That you were his princess
You don't see the castle
And you cannot find your prince

And now you've grown a lot
And your dresses don't fit right
Your daddy's not a hero
He stole your chariot

So here you are in pieces
Trying to prove to us it's real
The softness of your smile
And the lies you want to feel

The scales beneath your skin
Are showing off today
There's evil in your heart
And it wants out to play

There's evil in your heart
And it wants out to play
There's evil in your heart

And I made a home here for me
Don't burn it down with your fantasies
And I made a home here for me
Don't burn it down with your fantasies

"Breathe (Until Tomorrow)"

I climb, I slip, I fall
Reaching for your hands
But I lay here all alone
Sweating all your blood

If I could find out how
To make you listen now
Because I'm starving for you here
With my undying love
And I, I will

Breathe for love tomorrow
Cause there's no hope for today
Breathe for love tomorrow
Cause maybe there's another way

I climb, I slip, I fall
Reaching for your hands
But I lay here all alone
Sweating all your blood

If I could find out how
To make you listen now
Because I'm starving for you here
With my undying love
And I, I will

Breathe for love tomorrow
Cause there's no hope for today
Breathe for love tomorrow
Cause maybe there's another way

Breathe for love tomorrow
Cause there's no hope for today
Breathe for love tomorrow
Cause maybe there's another way

I climb, I slip, I fall
Into your empty hands
But I lay here all alone
Sweating all your blood

"Evil In Your Heart"

"Hello Cold World"

I feel happy, I feel sad, I feel like running through the walls
I'm overjoyed, I'm undecided, I don't know who I am
Well maybe I'm not perfect, at least I'm working on it
22 is like the worst idea that I've ever had
It's too much pain, it's too much freedom, what should I do with this
It's not the way you plan it, it's how you make it happen
Yeah, it's how you make it happen

It's such a cold, cold world (hello cold world)
And I can't get out, so I'll just make the best of everything I'll never have
It's such a cold, cold world (hello cold world)
And it's got me down, but I'll get right back up, as long as it spins around
Hello cold world
Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh

Girls and boys keep lining up to see if they can measure up
They look good, and they feel wild, but it will never be enough
You say you're really hurting, at least you're feeling something
We can hope and we can pray that everything will work out fine
But you can't just stay down on your knees, the revolution is outside
You wanna make a difference, get out and go begin it
Whoa, get out and go begin it

It's such a cold, cold world (hello cold world)
And I can't get out, so I'll just make the best of everything I'll never have
It's such a cold, cold world (hello cold world)
And it's got me down, but I'll get right back up, as long as it spins around
Hello cold world

Oh oh
(Oh oh...) Don't need my eyes open... wide
(Oh oh...) I just wanna feel something

Such a cold, cold world (hello cold world)
And I can't get out, so I'll just make the best of everything I'll never have
It's such a cold, cold world (hello cold world)
And it's got me down, but I'll get right back up, as long as it spins around (spins around)
Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh (Hello cold world)
Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh (Hello cold world)

"Hello Hello"

Hello, hello
Is anyone home
Hello, hello
Just pick up the phone

I opened up my life to you
I told you everything I knew
You listened so closely to
You listened so close when love was just a way out
But you're going deaf now
Yeah you turned your head around

Hello, hello
Is anyone home
Hello, hello
Just pick up the phone
You'll be sorry to hear
I'm doing fine now
Sorry to hear
You're without me now

You blew up the world I built for us
Destroyed our secret universe
Threw out the trust I, put in you
Making me feel like I'd been used
And now I'm reminded
That I was just blinded

Hello, hello
Is anyone home
Hello, hello
Just pick up the phone
You'll be sorry to hear
I'm doing fine now
Sorry to hear
You're without me now

I'm doing fine
You'll be alright
Maybe you'll think of me tonight
You're doing fine
And I'll be alright
Just give me time, yeah

Hello, hello
Is anyone home
Hello, hello
Just pick up the phone
I don't wanna hear
You're doing fine now
Don't wanna hear
I'm without you now

I'm without you now
I'm without you

"I Caught Myself"
(from "Twilight" soundtrack)

Down to you
You're pushing and pulling me down to you
But I don't know what I
Now when I caught myself
I had to stop myself
From saying something
That I should've never thought
Now when I caught myself
I had to stop myself
From saying something
That I should've never thought of you of you

You're pushing and pulling me down to you
But I don't know what I want
No, I don't know what I want

You got it you got it
Some kind of magic
Hypnotic hypnotic
You're leaving me breathless
I hate this I hate this
You're not the one I believe in
With God as my witness

Now when I caught myself
I had to stop myself
From saying something
That I should've never thought
Now when I caught myself
I had to stop myself
From saying something
That I should've never thought of you of you

You're pushing and pulling me down to you
But I don't know what I want
No, I don't know what I want

Don't know what I want
But I know it's not you
Keep pushing and pulling me down
When I know in my heart it's not you

Now when I caught myself
I had to stop myself
I'm saying something
That I should've never thought
Now when I caught myself
I had to stop myself
I'm saying something
That I should've never thought of you

I knew, I know in my heart it's not you
I knew, but now I know what I want, I want, I want
Oh no, I should have never thought

"In The Mourning"

You escaped like a runaway train
Off the tracks and down again
And my heart's beating like a steam boat tugging all your burdens
On my shoulders

And in the mourning I'll rise
In the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning, all my worries

And now there's nothing but time that's wasted
And words that have no backbone
And now it seems like the whole world's waiting
Can you hear the echoes fading

In the mourning I'll rise
In the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning, all my sorries

And it takes all my strength not to dig you up
From the ground in which you lay
The biggest part of me
You were the greatest thing
And now you're just a memory
To let go of

And in the mourning I'll rise
And in the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning, all my sorries

In the mourning I'll rise
In the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning, all my sorries

"Just Like Me"

I slipped down the stairs
Tripped over your fragile ego
I slid down the hallway
Right into the web you'd woven

And you never said
That you meant to save someone
Somebody just like me
And you never told me
You wanted to love someone
Somebody just like me

You locked all the doors
You felt it was safer that way
You put up a wall
And now your whole world is caving in

And you never said
That you meant to save someone
Somebody just like me
And you never told me
You wanted to love someone
Somebody just like me

You swallow your pride as
You left behind
Counting stars to name your lies
You let the rain
Push you away
And now you're drowning in the waves

Yeah
And you never said
That you meant to save someone
Somebody just like me
And you never told me
You wanted to love someone
Somebody just like me

And you never told me
You wanted to love someone
Somebody just like
Somebody just like me
And you never said
That you meant to save someone
Like me
Somebody just like me

"Monster"
(from "Transformers Dark of the Moon" soundtrack)

You were my conscience
So solid, now you're like water
And we started drowning
Not like we'd sink any farther

But I let my heart go
It's somewhere down at the bottom
But I'll get a new one
And come back for the hope that you've stolen

I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world from turning into a monster eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder how we survive
Well, now that you're gone, the world is ours

Ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah, ah

I'm only human
I've got a skeleton in me
But I'm not the villain
Despite what you're always preaching

Call me a traitor
I'm just collecting your victims
And they're getting stronger
I hear them calling, calling, calling

I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world from turning into a monster eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder how we survive
Well, now that you're gone, the world is ours

Well, you find your strength in solutions
But I like the tension
And not always knowing the answers
But you're gonna lose it
You're gonna lose it

I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world from turning into a monster eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder how we survive
Well, now that you're gone, the world

I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world from turning into a monster eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder how we survive
Now that you're gone, the world is ours

"My Number One"

You're my number one (you're my number one)
You're my golden star
I look at Earth from here
Still you don't seem so far

But you will never know
(You will never know)
Oh you will never know

Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
Oh, I would never admit that I
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
Oh, I would never admit that I
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
Oh, I would never admit that I
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh

Do you think of me
Do you wonder
If we could ever be residing under

Because we will never know
(We will never know)
Until I see you show through

Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
Oh, I would never admit that I
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
Oh, I would never admit that I
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
Oh, I would never admit that I
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh

I
I wish I could tell you how I feel
And show you what's inside of me is real
Don't know what I'm waiting for
Can't explain it anymore, yeah

Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
Oh, I would never admit that I
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
No, I would never admit that I
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
Oh, I would never admit that I
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh

I
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
And I love
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
I love
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
I love you

"Oh Father (Outro)"

Oh father
Oh father
Oh father
Oh father [or "My Jesus"]

Father, well I'm ready
Won't you let it begin
'Cause I'm here now
I want to dance in the mighty palm of your hand

"Renegade"

And the grass wasn't green enough here
After watering it with my tears
I'm not sure where you went
Now we are just past tense

And the snakes, they are slithering in
Chasing me to my end
I can't say where that is
I'm running again

And when I get there
It won't be far enough
I'm a renegade
It's in my blood
If ever I get there
It won't be fast enough
I'm a renegade
I always was

And the spark never lit up a fire
Though I tried and tried and tried
The wind came from your lungs
A hurricane from your tongue

And I'll keep your secrets with me
Right behind my teeth
Your anger, your anchor
But I'll sail much further on, on, on

And when I get there
It won't be far enough
I'm a renegade
It's in my blood
If ever I get there
It won't be fast enough
I'm a renegade
I always was

I'll keep running
I'll keep running again, keep running
I'll keep running, running, running
Keep running, running, running

I'll keep running
I'll keep running again, keep running
I'll keep running, running, running
Keep running, running, running

And when I get there
It won't be far enough
I'm a renegade
It's in my blood
If ever I get there
It won't be fast enough
I'm a renegade
It's in my blood

I'm a renegade
I always was

"Stay Away"

Your lies are bleeding through your teeth
Your eyes see only one thing in me
Your promises never really meant a thing
But they flowed from your lips so easily

Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay away from me
Stay, stay, stay, stay away
Stay, stay, stay, stay away from me
Stay, stay, stay, stay away, away 

It's my best at your heart
The glass that rips your word apart
Is it the guilt that keeps you up at night when you're in bed
Well you can sleep sound honey, I'll write you a check

Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay away from me
Stay, stay, stay, stay away
Stay, stay, stay, stay away from me
Stay, stay, stay, stay away, away 

I never was too good with goodbyes
You made it easy when your glee presided
With all the evil that you've provided
You still put the "good" in "goodbye"
In goodbye, in goodbye

Stay away, stay, stay, stay away from me
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay away from me
Stay, stay, stay, stay away from me
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay away from me

"Swim In Silence"

Meet me here beneath the burning skies
Where the ocean comes and takes us from all of our lives
You never said that you were coming back
I have waited although I have found the place you hide

What keeps you so far away

We can swim in silence
You can pull me under
I will not come up for anyone
I can slowly sink and
Watch you as you leave but
I will drown until you care

I will drown until you care

I imagine what it must be like
To have everything you need and not be satisfied
Run the water 'til it burns
And you can't see through the waves that crash into your pride

What keeps you so far away

We can swim in silence
You can pull me under
I will not come up for anyone
I can slowly sink and
Watch you as you leave but
I will drown until you care

Going under
Going under

Getting close to what we cannot recognize
Floating face down in the lies
Here we are without a trace
Oh, but the lies we used to blame
And you're so far away

What keeps you so far away

We can swim in silence
You can pull me under
I will not come up for anyone
I can slowly sink and
Watch you as you leave but
I will drown until you care

I will drown until you care

We can swim in silence
You can pull me under
I will not come up for anyone

We can swim in silence
You can pull me under
I will not come up for anyone

(Yeah, whoa, yeah)

I will drown until you care

"Throwing Punches"

There's an empty room
At the end of the hall
And it's begging to
Swallow you whole

Each step you take
Makes it easier to
Fall on your face
Each tear you fake
Makes it easier to
See straight through you, now

And you're so hateful sometimes
Throwing punches and lies
Fall from somewhere above
Just to say you're in love

So you hang yourself
From stolen dreams
And under the table, you hide
Every stain

Each step you take
(Getting closer)
Makes it easier to
Fall on your face
Each death you fake
(Getting closer)
Makes it easier to
Live this way
Hey, now

And you're so hateful sometimes
Throwing punches and lies
Fall from somewhere above
Just to say you're in love

Watch it disappear
The dream you hold so dear
Let it fade
(Let it fade)
Let it fade
(Let it fade)
Let it fade
(Let it fade)
Now

And you're so hateful sometimes
Throwing punches and lies
Fall from somewhere above
Just to say you're in love

And you're so hateful sometimes
Throwing punches and lies
Fall from somewhere above
Just to say you're in love

Just to say you're in love

"Take Me To Church"

My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner

If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

"We were born sick," you heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine-looking high horse
What you got in the stable
We've a lot of starving faithful

That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No Masters or Kings
When the Ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin

In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Ooh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

"Angel Of Small Death & The Codeine Scene"

I watch the work of my kin bold and boyful
Toying somewhere between love and abuse
Calling to join them the wretched and joyful
Shaking the wings of their terrible youths
Freshly disowned in some frozen devotion
No more alone or myself could I be
Lurched like a stray to the arms that were open
No shortage of sordid, no protest from me

With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh I
Lay my heart down with the rest at her feet
Fresh from the fields, all fetor and fertile
It's bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet

With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

Leash-less confusion I wander the concrete
Wonder if better now having survived
Jarring of judgment and reasons defeat
The sweet heat of her breath in my mouth I'm alive

With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

"Jackie And Wilson"

So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes
No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
So deep in this swill with the most familiar of swine
For reasons wretched and divine

She blows outta nowhere, roman candle of the wild
Laughing away through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would rather be tonight
And, Lord, she found me just in time

'Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
I need to be youthfully felt 'cause, God, I never felt young

She's gonna save me
Call me "baby"
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy
Soothe me daily
Better yet she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus
Be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children
Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

Lord, it'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
Sit back and watch the world go by

Happy to lie back watch it burn and rust
We tried the world, good God, it wasn't for us

She's gonna save me
Call me "baby"
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy
Soothe me daily
Better yet she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus
Be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children
Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

Cut clean from the dream at night let my mind reset
Looking up from a cigarette, and she's already left
I start digging up the yard for what's left of me and our little vignette
For whatever poor soul is coming next

She's gonna save me
Call me "baby"
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy
Soothe me daily
Better yet she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus
Be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children
Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

"Someone New"

Don't take this the wrong way
You knew who I was with every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black days
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose

Would things be easier if there was a right way
Honey, there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new

There's an art to life's distractions
To somehow escape the burning weight, the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else, I guess any thrill will do

Would things be easier if there was a right way
Honey, there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new

I wake at the first cringe of morning
And my heart's already sinned
How pure, how sweet a love, Aretha, that you would pray for him

'Cause God knows I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day

Love with every stranger, the stranger the better
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better

I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new

"To Be Alone"

Never feel too good in crowds
With folks around, when they're playing
The anthems of rape culture loud
Crude and proud creatures baying
All I've ever done is hide
From our times when you're near me
Honey, when you kill the lights, and kiss my eyes
I feel like a person for a moment of my life

But you don't know what hell you put me through
To have someone kiss the skin that crawls from you
To feel your weight in arms I'd never use
It's the God that heroin prays to

It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh to be alone with you

There are questions I can't ask
Now at last the worst is over
See the way you hold yourself
Reel against your body's borders
I know that you hate this place
Not a trace of me would argue
Honey, we should run away, oh someday
Our baby and her momma
And the damaged love she made

But I don't know what else that I would do
Than try to kiss the skin that crawls from you
Than feel your weight in arms I'd never use
It's the God that heroin prays to

It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh to be alone with you
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh to be alone with you

"From Eden"

Babe, there's something tragic about you
Something so magic about you
Don't you agree

Babe, there's something lonesome about you
Something so wholesome about you
Get closer to me

No tired sighs, no rolling eyes, no irony
No 'who cares', no vacant stares, no time for me

Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on its sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

Babe, there's something wretched about this
Something so precious about this
Where to begin

Babe, there's something broken about this
But I might be hoping about this.
Oh, what a sin

To the strand a picnic plan for you and me
A rope in hand for your other man to hang from a tree

Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on its sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on its sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to hide outside your door

"In A Week"
(feat. Karen Cowley)

I have never known peace like the damp grass that yields to me
I have never known hunger like these insects that feast on me
A thousand teeth and yours among them, I know
Our hunger's appeased, our heart beats becoming slow

We'll lay here for years or for hours
Thrown here or found, to freeze or to thaw
So long, we'd become the flowers
Two corpses we were, two corpses I saw

And they'd find us in a week
When the weather gets hot
After the insects have made their claim
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you

I have never known sleep like this slumber that creeps to me
I have never known color like this morning reveals to me
And you haven't moved an inch such that I would not know
If you sleep always like this, the flesh calmly going cold

We'll lay here for years or for hours
Your hand in my hand, so still and discreet
So long, we'd become the flowers
We'd feed well the land and worry the sheep

And they'd find us in a week
When the cattle'd show fear
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you

And they'd find us in a week (We'll lay here for years or for hours)
When the weather gets hot (So long, we'd become the flowers)
And they'd find us in a week (We'll lay here for years or for hours)
When the cattle'd show fear (So long, we'd become the flowers)

And they'd find us in a week
When the buzzards get loud
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
After the raven has had his say
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you

"Sedated"

Just a little rush, babe
To feel dizzy, to derail the mind of me
Just a little hush, babe
My veins are busy but my heart's in atrophy
Any way to distract and sedate
Adding shadows to the walls of the cave

You and I nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it

Something isn't right, babe
I keep catching little words but the meaning's thin
I'm somewhere outside my life, babe
I keep scratching but somehow I can't get in
So we're slaves to any semblance of touch
Lord we should quit but we love it too much

Sedated we're nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it

Darlin', don't you, stand there watching, won't you
Come and save me from it
Darlin', don't you, join in, you're supposed to
Drag me away from it

Any way to distract and sedate
Adding shadows to the walls of the cave

You and I nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it

Sedated we're nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it

"Work Song"

Boys workin' on empty
Is that the kinda way to face the burning heat
I just think about my baby
I'm so full of love I could barely eat
There's nothing sweeter than my baby
I'd never want once from the cherry tree
Cause my baby's sweet as can be
She'd give me toothaches just from kissin' me

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

Boys, when my baby found me
I was three days on a drunken sin
I woke with her walls around me
Nothin' in her room but an empty crib
And I was burnin' up a fever
I didn't care much how long I lived
But I swear I thought I dreamed her
She never asked me once about the wrong I did

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

My babe would never fret none
About what my hands and my body done
If the Lord don't forgive me
I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me
When I was kissin' on my baby
And she put her love down soft and sweet
In the low lamp light I was free
Heaven and hell were words to me

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

"Like Real People Do"

I had a thought, dear
However scary
About that night
The bugs and the dirt
Why were you digging
What did you bury
Before those hands pulled me
From the earth

I will not ask you where you came from
I will not ask and neither should you

Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do

I knew that look dear
Eyes always seeking
Was there in someone
That dug long ago
So I will not ask you
Why you were creeping
In some sad way I already know

So I will not ask you where you came from
I would not ask and neither would you

Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do

I could not ask you where you came from
I could not ask and neither could you

Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
We could just kiss like real people do

"It Will Come Back"

You know better babe, you know better babe
Than to look at it, look at it like that
You know better babe, you know better babe
Than to talk to it, talk to it like that

Don't give it a hand, offer it a soul
Honey, make this easy
Leave it to the land, this is what it knows
Honey, that's how it sleeps

Don't let it in with no intention to keep it
Jesus Christ Don't be kind to it
Honey don't feed it - it will come back

You know better babe, you know better babe
Than to smile at me, smile at me like that
You know better babe, you know better babe
Than to hold me just, hold me just like that

I know who I am when I'm alone
I'm something else when I see you
You don't understand, you should never know
How easy you are to need

Don't let me in with no intention to keep me
Jesus Christ Don't be kind to me
Honey don't feed me - I will come back

It can't be unlearned
I've known the warmth of your doorways
Through the cold, I'll find my way back to you
Oh please, give me mercy no more
It's a kindness you can't afford
I want you baby tonight, as sure as you're born

You'll hear me howling outside your door
Don't you hear me howling babe
Won't you hear me howling babe
Don't you hear me howling babe
Once you hear me howling, once you hear me howling, once you hear me howling babe

"Foreigner's God"

She moved with shameless wonder
The perfect creature rarely seen
Since some liar brought the thunder
When the land was godless and free

Her eyes look sharp and steady
Into the empty parts of me
But still my heart is heavy
With the hate of some other man's beliefs

Always a well-dressed fraud
Who wouldn't spare the rod
Never for me

Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
The purest expression of grief

Wondering who I copy
Mustering some tender charm
She feels no control of her body
She feels no safety in my arms

I've no language left to say it
But all I do is quake to her
Breaking if I try convey it
The broken love I make to her

All that I've been taught
And every word I've got
Is foreign to me

Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
The purest expression of grief

Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
The purest expression of grief

Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
The purest expression of grief

"Cherry Wine"

Her eyes and words are so icy
Oh but she burns
Like rum on a fire
Hot and fast and angry
As she can be
I walk my days on a wire

It looks ugly, but it's clean
Oh mamma, don't fuss over me

The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

Calls of guilty thrown at me
All while she stains
The sheets of some other
Thrown at me so powerfully
Just like she throws with the arm of her brother

But I want it, it's a crime
That she's not around most of the time

Way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

Her fight and fury is fiery
Oh but she loves
Like sleep to the freezing
Sweet and right and merciful
I'm all but washed
In the tide of her breathing

And it's worth it, it's divine
I have this some of the time

Way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

"In The Woods Somewhere"

My head was warm
My skin was soaked
I called your name
'Til the fever broke

When I awoke
The moon still hung
The night so black
That the darkness hums

I raised myself
My legs were weak
I prayed my mind
Be good to me

An awful noise
Filled the air
I heard a scream
In the woods somewhere

A woman's voice
I quickly ran
Into the trees
With empty hands

A fox it was
He shook afraid
I spoke no word
No sound he made

His bone exposed
His hind was lame
I raised a stone
To end his pain

What caused the wound
How large the teeth
I saw new eyes
Were watching me

The creature lunged
I turned and ran
To save a life
I didn't have

Deer in the chase
There as I flew
Forgot all prayers
Of joining you

I clutched my life
And wished it kept
My dearest love
I'm not done yet

How many years
I know I'll bear
I found something
In the woods somewhere

"Run"

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

Oh but the farrow know
Her hungry eye, her ancient soul
It's carried by the sneering menagerie

Know what it is to grow
Beneath her sky, her punishing cold
To slowly learn of her ancient misery

To be twisted by something
A shame without a sin
Like how she twisted the bog man
After she married him

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

But in all the world
There is one lover worthy of her
With as many souls claimed as she

But for all he's worth
He still shatters always on her earth
The cause of every tear she'd ever weep

Rushing ashore to meet her
Foaming with loneliness
White hands to fondle and beat her
Give her his onliness

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run 'til you feel your lungs bleeding

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

"Arsonist's Lullabye"

[Humming]

When I was a child, I heard voices...
Some would sing and some would scream
You soon find you have few choices...
I learned the voices died with me

When I was a child, I'd sit for hours
Staring into open flame
Something in it had a power,
Could barely tear my eyes away

All you have is your fire...
And the place you need to reach -
Don't you ever tame your demons
But always keep 'em on a leash

[Humming]

When I was 16, my senses fooled me
Thought gasoline was on my clothes
I knew that something would always rule me...
I knew the scent was mine alone

All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons
But always keep 'em on a leash

When I was a man I thought it ended
When I knew love's perfect ache
But my peace has always depended
On all the ashes in my wake

All you have is your fire,
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons,
But always keep 'em on a leash...

"My Love Will Never Die"

You've done
Me wrong
For a long
Long time

But after all
You've done
I never changed
My mind

Honey please
Try to love me
Honey please
Honey try
My love will never die

Flowers
Flowers grow
Where I'm laid
To rest

Honey pick
A blossom
And hold it
Hold it
To your breast

Honey you know
That's my love
Bursting loud
From inside

My love
Oh my love my love
Will never die

"Nina Cried Power"
(feat. Mavis Staples)

[Hozier]
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It is the grounding of a foot uncompromising
It's not forgoing of the lie
It's not the opening of eyes
It's not the waking, it's the rising

It's not the shade, we should be past it
It's the light, and it's the obstacle that casts it
It's the heat that drives the light
It's the fire it ignites
It's not the waking, it's the rising

It's not the song, it is the singing
It's the heaven of a human spirit ringing
It is the bringing of the line
It is the bearing of the rhyme
It's not the waking, it's the rising

[Hozier & Mavis Staples]
And I could cry power (Power), power (Power)
Power, Lord
Nina cried power
Billie cried power
Mavis cried power
And I could cry (Power) power, (Power) power
Hey, power
Curtis cried power
Patti cried power
Nina cried power

[Hozier]
It's not the wall, but what's behind it
Oh, the fear of fellow man, it's mere assignment
And everything that we're denied
By keeping the divide
It's not the waking, it's the rising

[Hozier & Mavis Staples]
And I could cry power (Power), power (Power)
Oh, power
Nina cried power
Lennon cried power
James Brown cried power
And I could cry (Power) power, (Power) power
Hey, power
B.B. cried power
Joni cried power
Nina cried power

[Mavis Staples]
And I could cry power
Power has been cried by those stronger than me
Straight into the face that tells you
To rattle your chains if you love being free

[Hozier & Mavis Staples]
But I could cry power (Power)
'Cause power is my love when my love reaches to me
James Brown cried power
Seeger cried power
Marvin cried power
Yeah ah, power
James cried power
Lennon cried power
Patti cried power
Billie, power
Dylan, power
Woody, power
Nina cried power

"NFWMB"

When I first saw you
The end was soon
To Bethlehem
It slouched and then
Must've caught a good look at you
Give your heart and soul to charity
'Cause the rest of you, the best of you
Honey, belongs to me

Ain't it a gentle sound, the rolling in the graves
Ain't it like thunder under earth, the sound it makes
Ain't it exciting you, the rumble where you lay

Ain't you my baby
Ain't you my baby

Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

If I was born as a black thorn tree
I'd wanna be felled by you, held by you
Fuel the pyre of your enemies
Ain't it warming you, the world goin' up in flames
Ain't it the life where you you're lighting off the blaze
Ain't it a waste it watch the throwing of the shade

Ain't you my baby
Ain't you my baby

Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

"Moment's Silence (Common Tongue)"

When stunted hand earns place with man by mere monstrosity
Alarms are struck and shore is shook by sheer atrocity
A cure I know that soothes the soul, does so impossibly
A moment's silence when my baby puts her mouth on

Me and my babe relax and catch the manic rhapsody
All reason flown, as God looks on in abject apathy
A squall, and all of me is a prayer in perfect piety
A moment's silence when my baby puts her mouth on me

When the meaning is gone
There is clarity
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me

And it's easy done
Our little remedy
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me

What yields the need for those who lead us oh so morally
Those that would view the same we do through their deformity
Who view the deed as power's creed, as pure authority
This moment's silence when my baby puts her mouth on me

Since it all begun
To its reckoning
There the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me

Be thankful some know it lovingly
There the reason comes in the common tongue of your loving me

Like a heathen clung to the homily
Let the reason come on the common tongue of your loving me

So summon on the pearl rosary
Let the reason come on the common tongue of your loving me

"Shrike"

I couldn't utter my love when it counted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now
And I couldn't whisper when you needed it shouted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now

The words hung above
But never would form
Like a cry at the final breath that is drawn
Remember me love when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp
And glorious thorn

I had no idea on what ground I was founded
All of that goodness is going with you now
Then when I met you, my virtues uncounted
All of my goodness is going with you now

Dragging along
Follow in your form
Hung like the pelt of some prey you had worn
Remember me love when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp
And glorious thorn

I fled to the city with so much discounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now
Back to the hedgerows where bodies are mounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now

I was housed by your warmth
Thus transformed
By your grounded and giving
And darkening scorn
Remember me love when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp
And glorious thorn

"Almost (Sweet Music)"

I came in from the outside, burnt out from a joyride
She likes to roll here in my ashes anyway
Played from the bedside is Stella by Starlight
That was my heart, the drums that start off night and day

The same kind of music haunts her bedroom
I'm almost me again, she's almost you

I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

Tell me who and I'll be thanking 'em
The numbered lovers of Duke Ellington
Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek as soft as Chet can sing
Let's get lost and let the good times roll
Let smoke rings from this paper doll
Blow sweet and thick 'til every thought of it don't mean a thing

I got some colour back, she thinks so, too
I laugh like me again, she laughs like you

I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know

The very thought of you and am I blue
A love supreme seems far removed
I get along without you very well some other nights
Oh the radio newsreader chimes
Reporting Russian lullabies
She'll turn to me, awake, and ask, 'Is everything alright'

And, Lord, I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start (I wouldn't know where)
Sweet music playin' in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

I wouldn't know where to start (I wouldn't know where)
Sweet music playin' in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start (I wouldn't know where)
Sweet music playin' in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

"Movement"

I still watch you when you're groovin'
As if through water from the bottom of a pool
You're movin' without movin'
And when you move, I'm moved
You are a call to motion
There all of you a verb in perfect view
Like Jonah on the ocean
When you move, I'm moved

When you move
I'm put to mind of all that I wanna be
When you move
I could never define all that you are to me

So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby

You are the rite of movement
Its reasonin' made lucid and cool
And though it's no improvement
When you move, I move
You're less Polunin leapin'
Or Fred Astaire in sequins
Honey, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin'
And when you move, I'm moved

When you move
I can recall somethin' that's gone from me
When you move
Honey, I'm put in awe of somethin' so flawed and free

So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to prove
And nothin' to lose
Move me, baby

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh baby, oh baby
Move like grey skies
Move like a bird of paradise
Move like an odd sight come out at night

Move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to lose
And nothin' to prove
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby

"No Plan"

For starts
What a waste to say the heart could feel apart
Or feel complete, baby
Why would you make out of words
A cage for your own bird
When it sings so sweet
The screaming, heaving, fuckery of the world
Why would you offer a name
To the same old tired pain
When all things come from nothin'
And honey, if nothin's gained

My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
That's how I know now that you understand

There's no plan
There's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan
There's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan
There's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again

Let it hurl, let the awful song be heard
Blue bird, I know your beat, baby
But your secret is safe with me
'Cause if secrets were like seeds
Keep my body from the fire
Hire a gardener for my grave
Your secret is safe with me
And if secrets were like seeds
When I'm lying under marble
Marvel at flowers you'll have made

My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
That's how I know now that you understand

There's no plan
There's no race to be run
The harder the pain, honey, the sweeter the song
There's no plan
There's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan
There's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again

My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
That's how I know now that you understand
How big the hourglass, how deep the sand
I shouldn't have hoped to know, but here I stand

There's no plan
There's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan
There's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan
There's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again

"Nobody"

You know when it's twelve o'clock in Soho, baby
It's gin o'clock where I'll wake up, I don't know
And I think about you though everywhere I go
And I've done everything and I've been everywhere, you know

I've been fed gold
By sweet fools in Abu Dhabi
And I danced real slow
With Rockettes on dodgy Molly
But I've had no love like your love
Ooh from nobody

I'd be appalled if I saw you ever try to be a saint
I wouldn't fall for someone I thought couldn't misbehave
But I want you to know that I've had no love like your love

Honey, when you warm the bed on Wednesday
It's suicide Tuesday back in LA
If I had the choice between hearing either noise
The excitement of a thousand or the soothing of your voice

At first chance
I'd take the bed warmed by the body
I once warmed my hands
Over a burning Maserati
But I've had no love like your love
From nobody

I'd be appalled if I saw you ever try to be a saint
I wouldn't fall for someone I thought couldn't misbehave
But I want you to know that I've had no love like your love
And on the other side, why should we deny the truth
We could have less to worry about, honey, I won't lie to you
But everything I do I've had no love like your love

"To Noise Making (Sing)"

Remember when you'd sing, just for the fuck of it
And any joy it would bring
Honey, the look of it was as sweet as the sound
Your head tilt back, your funny mouth to the clouds
I couldn't hope to know that song and all its words
Wouldn't claim to feel the same we felt the first time it was heard
I couldn't name that feeling carried in that voice
Was it that or just the act of making noise that brought you joy

You don't have to sing it right
But who could call you wrong
To put your emptiness to melody
Your awful heart to song
You don't have to sing it nice, but, honey, sing it strong
At best, you find a little remedy, at worst the world will sing along

So honey, sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing
Sing, sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, sing

Remember when you'd sing before we'd move to it
And we'd scuff up our shoes, honey, the groove of it
Was whatever you choose
"I Wanna Be Your Lover" or "The Fisherman's Blues"

You didn't always sing it right
But who could call you wrong
To put your emptiness to melody
Your awful heart to song
You don't have to sing it nice, but, honey, sing it strong
At best, you find a little remedy, at worst the world will sing along

So honey, sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing
Sing, sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, sing

Who could ask you be unbroken or be brave again
Or, honey, hope even on this side of the grave again
And who could ask you to be sound or to feel saved again
Just stick around until you hear that music play again

So honey, sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing
Sing, sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, sing
So honey, sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing
Sing, sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, sing
For the love of it
So honey, sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing
Sing, sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, sing
For the love of it

Remember when you'd sing, just for the love of it
And any joy it would bring

"As It Was"

There is a roadway
Muddy and foxgloved
Whenever I'd had life enough
My heart is screaming of

And in a few days
I will be there, love
Whatever here that's left of me
Is yours just as it was

Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark,
The light, the flame

The highs hit the heights of my baby
And its hold had the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved

Tell me if somehow
Some of it remains
How long you would wait for me
How long I've been away

The shape that I'm in now
Your shape in the doorway
Make your good love known to me
Or just tell me about your day

Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark,
The light, the shame

The highs hit the heights of my baby
And its hold had the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved

And the sights were as stark as my baby
And the cold cut as sharp as my baby
And the nights were as dark as my baby
Half as beautiful too

"Shrike"

I couldn't utter my love when it counted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now
And I couldn't whisper when you needed it shouted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now

But never would form
Like a cry at the final breath that is drawn
Remember me love when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp
And glorious thorn

I had no idea on what ground I was founded
All of that goodness is going with you now
Then when I met you, my virtues uncounted
All of my goodness is going with you now

Hung like the pelt of some prey you had worn

Back to the hedgerows where bodies are mounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now

And darkening scorn
Remember me love when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp
And glorious thorn

"Talk"

I'd be the voice that urged Orpheus
When her body was found
Hey yeah
I'd be the choiceless hope in grief
That drove him underground
Hey yeah
I'd be the dreadful need in the devotee
That made him turn around
Hey yeah
And I'd be the immediate forgiveness
In Eurydice
Imagine being loved by me

I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things I would do
So I try to talk refined
For fear that you find out (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imagining you

I'd be the last shred of truth
In the lost myth of true love
Hey yeah
I'd be the sweet feeling of release
Mankind now dreams of
Hey yeah
That's found in the last witness before the wave hits
Marvelling at God
Hey yeah
Before he feels alone one final time
And marries the sea
Imagine being loved by me

I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things I would do
So I try to talk refined
For fear that you find out (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imagining you

I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things we could do
So I try to talk refined
For fear that you find out (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imagining you

"Be"

When all the worst we fear lets fall its weight
When the gyre widens on and when the wave breaks
When St. Peter loses cool and bars the Gates
When Atlas acts the maggot, makes his arms shake
When the birds are heard again in their singing
Once atrocity is hoarse from voicing shame
When the earth is trembling on some new beginning
With the same sweet shock of when Adam first came

Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been (lover, be good to me)

Be as you've always been (lover, be good to me)
Be like the love that discovered sin (lover, be good to me)
That freed the first man and will do so again
And lover, be good to me (lover, be good to me)
Be the hopeful feeling when Eden was lost (lover, be good to me)
That's been deaf to our laughter since the master was crossed (lover, be good to me)
Which side of the wall really suffers that cost
Oh lover, be good to me

When the man who gives the order
Is born next time around on the boat sent back
When the bodies starving at the border
Are on TV giving people the sack
Oh, when the sea rises to meet us
Oh when there's nothing left for you and I to do
Oh when there's nobody upstairs to receive us
When I have no kind words left, love for you now

Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been (lover, be good to me)

Be love in its disrepute (lover, be good to me)
That scorches the hillside and salts every root (lover, be good to me)
And watches the slowing and starving of troops
And lover, be good to me (lover, be good to me)
Be there and just as you stand (lover, be good to me)
Or be like the rose that you hold in your hand (lover, be good to me)
That will grow bold in a barren and desolate land
And lover, be good to me (lover, be good to me)

Love won't you be
Love won't you be
Be as you've always been
Love won't you be
Love won't you be
Be as you've always been
Love won't you be
Love won't you be
Be as you've always been
Love won't you be
Love won't you be
Be as you've always been

(Lover, be good to me)

"Dinner & Diatribes"

Honey this club here is stuck up
Dinner and Diatribes
I knew well from our first hookup
The look of mischief in your eye
Your friends are a fate that befell me
Hell is the talking type
I'd suffer hell if you'd tell me
What you'd do to me tonight

Tell me
Tell me
Tell me

That's the kinda love
I've been dreaming of
That's the kinda love
I've been dreaming of

Honey I laugh when it sinks in
A pillar, I am upright
Scarcely can speak for my thinking what
You'd do to me tonight
Now that the evening is slowing
Now that the end's in sight
Honey, it's easier knowing what
You'd do to me tonight

Tell me
Tell me
Tell your man

That's the kinda love
I've been dreaming of
That's the kinda love
I've been dreaming of

That's the kinda love
That's the kinda love
That's the kinda love
That's the kinda love...

Ohhhh
Let there be hotel complaints and grievances raised
And that kind of love
Ohhhh
Let there be damage ensued and tabloid news
And that kind of love

That's the kinda love
I've been dreaming of
That's the kinda love
I've been dreaming of

"Would That I"

True that I saw her hair like the branch of a tree
Willow dancing on air before covering me
Under cotton and calicos
Over canopy dapple long ago
True that love in withdrawal was the weeping of me
That the sound of the saw must be known by the tree
Must be felled for to fight the cold
I fretted fire but that was long ago

And it's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where I'm set alight (Oooh, oooh)
And I blink in sight (Oooh, oooh)
Your blinding light (Oooh)
Oh, it's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where you hold me tight (Oooh, oooh)
And the fire bright (Oooh, oooh)
Oh, let it blaze, alright (Oooh)

Oh, but you're good to me
Oh, you're good to me
Oh, but you're good to me, baby

With the roar of the fire my heart rose to its feet
Like the ashes of ash I saw rise in the heat
Settle soft and as pure as snow
I fell in love with the fire long ago
With each love I cut loose I was never the same
Watching still living roots be consumed by the flame
I was fixed on your hand of gold
Laying waste to my loving long ago

But that's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where I'm set alight (Oooh, oooh)
And I blink in sight (Oooh, oooh)
Of your blinding light (Oooh)
And it's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where you hold me tight (Oooh, oooh)
And the fire bright (Oooh, oooh)
Oh, let it blaze, alright, honey (Oooh)

Oh, but you're good to me
Oh, you're good to me
Oh, but you're good to me, baby

So in awe there I stood as you licked off the grain
Though I've handled the wood, I still worship the flame
Long as amber of ember glows
All the "would that I loved" is long ago

And it's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where I'm set alight (Oooh, oooh)
And I blink in sight (Oooh, oooh)
Of your blinding light (Oooh)
Oh, it's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where you hold me tight (Oooh, oooh)
And the fire bright (Oooh, oooh)
Oh, let it blaze, alright (Oooh)

Oh, but you're good to me
Oh, you're good to me
Oh, but you're good to
Oh, you're good to me
You're good to me
Oh, but you're good to me, baby

"Sunlight"

I would shun the light
Share in evening's cool and quiet
Who would trade that hum of night
For sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
Whose heart would not take flight
Betray the moon as acolyte
On first and fierce affirming sight
Of sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

I had been lost to you, sunlight
And flew like a moth to you, sunlight
Oh sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight

Oh, the tale is the same
Told before and told again
A soul that's born in cold and rain
Knows sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
At last can grant a name
To a buried and a burning flame
As love and its decisive pain
Oh my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

All that was shown to me, sunlight
Was something foreknown to me, sunlight
Oh sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Sunlight

All these colours fade for you only
Carry me slowly, my sunlight
All these colours fade for you only
Carry me slowly, my sunlight

Each day you rise with me
Know that I would gladly be
The Icarus to your certainty
Oh my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
Strap the wing to me
Death trap clad, happily
With wax melted I'd meet the sea
Under sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight

Sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

"Wasteland, Baby"

All the fear and the fire of the end of the world
Happens each time a boy falls in love with a girl
Happens great, happens sweet
Happily, I'm unfazed here, too

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you

All the things yet to come are the things that have passed
Like the holding of hands, like the breaking of glass
Like the bonfire that burns
That all words in the fight fell to

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you

And I love too that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's just wasteland, baby

And that day that we'll watch the death of the sun
To the cloud and the cold and those jeans you have on
And you'll gaze unafraid as they sob from the city roofs

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you

And I love too that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's wasteland, baby

When the stench of the sea and the absence of green
Are the death of all things that are seen and unseen
Are an end but the start of all things that are left to do

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you

(That's it)

"De Selby (Part 1)"

At last
When all of the world is asleep
You take in the blackness of air
The likes of a darkness so deep
That God at the start couldn't bear
And sit unseen
With only the inner upheld
Your reflection can't offer a word
To the bliss of not knowing yourself
With all mirroring gone from the world

But still the mind
Rejecting this new empty space
Fills it with something or someone
No closer could I be to God
Or why he would do what he's done

Bhfuilis soranna sorcha
Ach tagais 'ns na hoche
Trna chile le chile claochlaithe
Bhfuilis soranna sorcha
Ach tagais 'ns na hoche
Is claochl an ealan
Is ealan dubh 

Bhfuilis soranna sorcha
Ach tagais 'ns na hoche
Trna chile le chile claochlaithe
Bhfuilis soranna sorcha
Ach tagais 'ns na hoche
Is claochl an ealan
Is ealan dubh 

"De Selby (Part 2)"

What you're given
What you live in
Darling, it finds a way to live in you
And your heart, love
Has such darkness
I feel it in the corners of the room

(If I was any closer)
After the gloom
(I could only lose me)
I wanna lose me, I
(If I fade away, let me fade away)
I wanna fade away with you
(If I was any closer)
If I was any closer
(I could only lose me)
I could be lost
(If I fade away, let me fade away)
No more than I was or than I

Want to be when you fall on me like night
Every time
And I want to be so far from sight and mind
I wanna kill the lights

I wanna run against the world that's turning
I'd move so fast that I'd outpace the dawn
I wanna be gone
I wanna run so far, I'd beat the morning
Before the dawn has come, I'd block the Sun
If you want it done

Let all time slow
Let all light go
I don't need to know where we begin and end
I'd still know you
Not being shown you
I only need the working of my hands

(If I was any closer)
You understand
(I could only lose me)
I wanna lose me, I
(If I fade away, let me fade away)
I wanna fade away with you
(If I was any closer)
If I was any closer
(I could only lose me)
I could be lost
(If I fade away, let me fade away)
No more than I was or than I

Want to be when you fall on me like night
I wanna kill the lights

I wanna run against the world that's turning
I'd move so fast that I'd outpace the dawn
I wanna be gone
I wanna run so far, I'd beat the morning
Before the dawn has come, I'd block the Sun
If you want it done

(If I was any closer)
(I could only lose me)
(If I fade away, let me fade away)
(If I was any closer)
(I could only lose me)
(If I fade away, let me fade away)

I wanna run against the world that's turning
I'd move so fast that I'd outpace the dawn
I wanna be gone
I wanna run so far, I'd beat the morning
Before the dawn has come, I'd block the Sun
If you want it done

"First Time"

Remember once I told you about
How before I heard it from your mouth
My name would always hit my ears as such an awful sound
And the soul, if that's what you'd call it
Uneasy ally of the body, it felt nameless as a river
Undiscovered underground

And the first time that you kissed me
I drank dry the River Lethe
The Liffey would have been softer on my stomach all the same
But you spoke some quick new music
That went so far to soothe this soul
As it was and ever shall be, unearth without a name

Some part of me must have died
The first time that you called me, "Baby"
And some part of me came alive
The first time that you called me, "Baby"

These days I think I owe my life
To flowers that were left here by my mother
Ain't that like them, giftin' life to you again
This life lived mostly underground
Unknowin' either sight nor sound
'Til reachin' up for sunlight just to be ripped out by the stem

Sensing only now it's dyin'
Drying out, then drowning blindly
Bloomin' forth its every colour
In the moments it has left
To share the space with simple living things
Infinitely suffering, but fighting off like all creation
The absence of itself, anyway

Some part of me must have died
Each time that you called me, "Baby"
But some part of me stayed alive
Each time that you called, each time that you called

Come here
Ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la
Whatever keeps you around, it keeps you around
Ooh-la-la, come here, ooh-la-la
Whatever keeps you around, it keeps you around

The last time it was heard out loud
The perfect genius of our hands and mouths were shocked
To resignation as the arguing declined
When I was young I used to guess
Are there limits to any emptiness
When was the last time
Come here to me, when was the last time

Some part of me must have died
The final time that you called me, "Baby"
But some part of me came alive
The final time you called me, "Baby"

"Francesca"

Do you think I'd give up
That this might've shook the love from me
Or that I was on the brink
How could you think darling I'd scare so easily
Now that it's done
There's not one thing that I would change
My life was a storm
Since I was born
How could I fear any hurricane

If someone asked me at the end

I'll tell them put me back in it
Darling, I would do it again
If I could hold you for a minute
Darling, I'd go through it again
I would still be surprised I could find you, darling
In any life
If I could hold you for a minute
Darling, I would do it again

For all that was said
Of where we'd end up at the end of it
When the heart would cease
Ours never knew peace
What good would it be on the far side of things
But it was too soon
When that part of you was ripped away
A grip taking hold
Like a cancer that grows
Each piece of your body that it takes

Though I know my heart would break

I'll tell them put me back in it
Darling, I would do it again
If I could hold you for a minute
Darling, I'd go through it again
I would still be surprised I could find you, darling
In any life
If I could hold you for a minute
Darling, I would do it again

I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love
Like you and I
I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love
Like you and I
I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love
Like you and I

"I, Carrion (Icarian)"

If the wind turns
If I hit a squall
Allow the ground to find its brutal way to me

I feel lighter than I have in so much time
I've crossed the borderline of weightless
One deep breath out from the sky
I've reached a rarer height now
That I can confirm
All our weight is just a burden
Offered to us by the world
And though I burn
How could I fall
When I am lifted by every word you say to me

If anything could fall at all
It's the world that falls away from me

You have me floating like a feather on the sea
While you're as heavy as the world
That you hold your hands beneath
Once I had wondered
What was holding up the ground
I can see that all along, love
It was you all the way down
Leave it now
I am sky-bound
If you need to, darling
Lean your weight to me

We'll float away
But if we fall, I only pray
Don't fall away from me

I do not have wings, love
I never will
Soaring over a world you are carrying
If these heights should bring my fall
Let me be your own
Icarian carrion

If the wind turns
If I hit a squall
Allow the ground to find its brutal way to me
If I should fall on that day
I only pray
Don't fall away from me

"Eat Your Young"

I'm starving, darling
Let me put my lips to something
Let me wrap my teeth around the world
Start carving, darling
I wanna smell the dinner cooking
I wanna feel the edges start to burn

Honey, I wanna race you to the table
If you hesitate, the getting is gone
I won't lie, if there's something to be gained
There's money to be made, whatever's still to come

Get some
Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw enough rope until the legs have swung
Seven new ways that you can eat your young
Come and get some
Skinning the children for a war drum
Putting food on the table selling bombs and guns
It's quicker and easier to eat your young

You can't buy this fineness
Let me see the heat get to it
Let me watch the dressing start to peel
It's a kindness, Highness
Crumbs enough for everyone
Old and young are welcome to the meal

Honey, I'm making sure the table's made
We can celebrate the good that we've done
I won't lie, if there's something still to take
There is ground to break, whatever's still to come

Get some
Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw enough rope until the legs have swung
Seven new ways that you can eat your young
Come and get some
Skinning the children for a war drum
Putting food on the table selling bombs and guns
It's quicker and easier to eat your young

"Damage Gets Done"
(feat. Brandi Carlile)

Without shame
Two outfits then to my name
You'd end up in one when you'd stay
We had nowhere to go
And every desire for going there

I heard once
It's the comforts that make us feel numb
We'd go out with no way to get home
And we'd sleep on somebody's floor
And wake up feeling like a millionaire

Wish I'd known it was just our turn (We just got by)
Being blamed for a world we had no power in (But we tried)
You and I had nothing to show (We didn't know)
But the best of the world in the palm of our hands (Anything, darling)

And, darling, I haven't felt it since then
I don't know how the feeling ended
But I know being reckless and young
Is not how the damage gets done

One time we would want for nothing (One time we had it all, love)
We knew what our love was worth (When we had nothing)
Now we're always missing something (I miss when)
I miss when we did not need much

Oh, if the car ran, the car was enough
If the sun shone on us, it's a plus
And the tank was always filled up
Only enough for our getting there

(And you flew away) That first car was like wings on an angel
Before the whole wide world got too thin
(From me then) I swear goodwill kept up the engine
You were steering my heart like a wheel in your hands (Turn back, darling)

And, darling, I haven't felt it since then
I don't know how the feeling ended
But I know being reckless and young
Is not how the damage gets done

All I needed was someone
When the whole wide world felt young
All I needed was someone
When the whole wide world felt young

"Who We Are"

You only feel it when it's lost
Getting through still has a cost
Quietly, it slips through your fingers love
Falling from you drop by drop

What I had left here
I just held it tight
So someone with your eyes
Might come in time
To hold me like water
Or Christ
Hold me like a knife

We're born at night
So much of our lives
Is just carving through the dark
To get so far
And the hardest part
Is who we are
It's who we are

You and I burned out our steam
Chasing someone else's dream
How can something be so much heavier
But so much less than what it seems
Darling we sacrificed
We gave our time to something undefined
This phantom life
It sharpens like an image
But it sharpens like a knife

We're born at night
So much of our lives
Is just carving through the dark
To get so far
And the hardest part
Is who we are
It's who we are

You only feel it when it's lost
Getting through still has its cost
Quietly, it slips through your fingers love
Falling from you drop by drop

"All Things End"

A two-tonne weight around my chest feels like
It just dropped a twenty-storey height
If there was anyone to ever get through this life
With their heart still intact, they didn't do it right

The last time I felt your weight on my chest, you said
"We didn't get it right, but, love, we did our best"
And we will again
Moving on in time and taking more from everything that ends

And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
Or slips right through our hands
And just knowing that everything will end
Should not change our plans
When we begin again
We begin again

I have never known a silence like the one fallen here
Never watched my future darken in a single tear
I know we want this to go easy by being somebody's fault
But we've gone long enough to know this isn't what we want
And that isn't always bad
When people say that something is forever
Either way, it ends

And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
Or slips right through our hands
And just knowing that everything will end
Should not change our plans
When we begin again
We begin again
We begin again, darling

And all things end
All that we intend is built of sand
Slips right through our hands
And just knowing that everything will end
Won't change our plans
When we begin again

And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
Or slips right through our hands
And just knowing that everything will end
Should not change our plans
When we begin again

"To Someone From A Warm Climate (Uiscefhuaraithe)"

A joy hard-learned in winter was the warming of the bed
You'd shake for minutes there and move your legs
Wrap the blanket over you and keep your head within
Let your breath heat the air until you'd feel it getting thin

'Uiscefhuaraithe'
The feel of coldness only water brings
There are some things that no-one teaches you, love
That come natural as a dream you didn't know that you were in
And darling, all my dreaming
Is only put to shame
And darling, all my dreaming
Has only been given a name
But it came easy, darling
As natural as another leg around you in the bed frame

In summer's heat, I learned to dread the coming of the night
The awful things we do to make the head go quiet
You'd press your body to the concrete when you were small
The rains of winter seemed to never leave the walls

'Uiscefhuaraithe'
The feel of coolness only water brings
There are some things that no-one teaches you, love
That God in his awful wisdom just programs in
But darling, all my dreaming
Is only put to shame
And darling, all my dreaming
Has only been given a name
But it happened easy
Natural as another leg around you in the bed

And I wish I could say
That the river of my arms have found the ocean
And I wish I could say the cold lake water of my heart
Christ, it's boiling over

But it happened easy, darling
Natural as another leg around you in the bed frame

"Butchered Tongue"

As a child it was the place names
Singing at me as the first thing

How the mouth must be employed
In every corner of itself
To say "Appalacicola"
Or "Hushpukena" like "Gweebara"
A promise softly sung of somewhere else
And as a young man
Blessed to pass so many road signs
And have my foreign ear made fresh again
On each unlikely sound
But feel at home
Hearing a music
That few still understand
A butchered tongue still
Still singing here above the ground

The ears were chopped
From young men
If the pitch-cap didn't kill them
They are buried
Without scalp
In the shattered bedrock of our home
You may never know your fortune
Until the distance has been shown between
What is lost forever
And what can still be known

So far from home
To have a stranger call you darling
And have your guarded heart
Be lifted like a child up by the hand
In some town that just means
'Home' to them
With no translator left to sound
A butchered tongue
Still singing here above the ground

"Anything But"

C'mere to me. I wish I was a may fly on the River Tay
I'd fit all my joys and my pleasures in one perfect day
I wish I was the sunlight just sitting on The Mississippi
I'd settle for a shopping trolley in The Liffey
In a shot I'd swap my body for a body of water
Worry the cliff side top as a wave crashing over
I'd lower the world in a flood
Or better yet I'd cause a drought
If I was a rip tide
I wouldn't take you out

I don't wanna be anything
But I would do anything just to run away
I don't wanna be anything like this at all
But I would do anything if you'd hear me say

Go look another way
Look another way

Look, I wanna be loud
So loud, I'm talking seismic
I wanna be soft as a single stone in a rain stick
I wanna be the thunder of a hundred thousand hooves moving quick
If I was a stampede
You wouldn't get a kick

I wanna be the shadow when my bright future's behind me
I wanna be the last thing anybody ever sees
I hear he touches your hand, and then you fly away together
If I had his job
You would live forever

I don't wanna be anything
But I would do anything just to run away
I don't wanna be anything like this at all
I would do anything if you'd hear me say

Go look another way
Look another way

I don't wanna be anything, be anything
But I would do anything (Go look another way)
I don't wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be
Don't wanna be anything, anything

Go look another way
Look another way

"Abstract (Psychopomp)"

Sometimes it returns
Like rain that you slept through
That washed off the world
The streets looking brand new
I will not be great
But I'm grateful to get through
The feeling came late
I'm still glad I met you

The memory hurts
But does me no harm
Your hand in my pocket
To keep us both warm
The poor thing in the road
Its eye still glistening
The cold wet of your nose
The Earth from a distance

See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines

Sometimes there's a thought
Like you choose what you're doing
But it comes to nought
When I look back through it
I remember the view
Street lights in the dark blue
The moment I knew
I'd no choice but to love you

The speed that you moved
The screech of the cars
The creature still moving
That slowed in your arms
The fear in its eyes
Gone out in an instant
Your tear caught the light
The Earth from a distance

See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines

Darling, there's a part of me
I'm afraid will always be
Trapped within an abstract from a moment of my life
The weeds up through the concrete
The traffic picking up speed
All my love and terror
Balanced there between those eyes

See how it shines
See how it shines

"Unknown  Nth"

You know the distance never made a difference to me
I swam a lake of fire, I'd have walked across the floor of any sea
Ignored the vastness between all that can be seen
And all that we believe
So I thought you were like an angel to me

Funny how true colours shine in darkness and in secrecy
If there were scarlet flags
They washed out in the mind of me
Where a blinding light shone on you every night
And either side of my sleep
Where you were held frozen like an angel to me

It ain't the being alone
Sha-la-la
It ain't the empty home, baby
Sha-la-la
You know I'm good on my own
Sha-la-la
Sha-la-la, baby, you know it's more the being unknown
So much of the living, love, is the being unknown

You called me angel for the first time, my heart leapt from me
You smile now, I can see its pieces still stuck in your teeth
And what's left of it, I listen to it tick
Every tedious beat going unknown as any angel to me

Do you know, I could break beneath the weight
Of the goodness, love, I still carry for you
That I'd walk so far just to take
The injury of finally knowing you

It ain't the being alone
Sha-la-la
It ain't the empty home, baby
Sha-la-la
You know I'm good on my own
Sha-la-la
Sha-la-la, baby
You know it's more the being unknown
And there are some people, love, who are better unknown

"First Light"

One bright morning changes all things
Soft and easy as your breathing
You wake
Your eyes open at first a thousand miles away
But turning shoot a silver bullet point-blank range
And I can scarce believe what I'm believing in
Could this be how every day begins

The sky set to burst
The gold and the rust
The colour erupts
You filling my cup
The sun coming up

Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light

One bright morning goes so easy
Darkness always
Finds you either way
It creeps into the corners as the moment fades
A voice your body jumps to calling out your name
But after this I'm never gonna be the same
And I am never going back again

The sky set to burst
The gold and the rust
The colour erupts
You filling my cup
The sun coming up

Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light

"Better Love"
(from "The Legend Of Tarzan" soundtrack)

I once kneeled in shaking thrill
I chase the memory of it still, of every chill
Chided by that silence of a hush sublime
Blind to the purpose of the brute divine
But you were mine

Staring in the blackness at some distant star
The thrill of knowing how alone we are, unknown we are
To the wild and to the both of us
I confessed the longing I was dreaming of

Some better love, but there's no better love
Beckons above me and there's no better love
That ever has loved me, there's no better love
Darling, feel better love
Feel better love

I have never loved a darker blue
Than the darkness I have known in you, own from you
You, whose heart would sing of anarchy
You, who'd laugh at meaning's guarantee,
So beautifully

When our truth is burned from history
By those who figure justice in fond memory, witness me
Like fire weeping from a cedar tree
Know that my love would burn with me
We'll live eternally

Cause there's no better love
That beckons above me, there's no better love
That ever has loved me, there's no better love
So darling, feel better love
Cause there's no better love
That's laid beside me, there's no better love
That justifies me, there's no better love
So darling, darling, feel better love
Feel better love

Feel better love
Feel better love
Feel better love

Cause there's no better love
That beckons above me, there's no better love
That ever has loved me, there's no better love
So darling, feel better love
Cause there's no better love
That's laid beside me, there's no better love
That justifies me, there's no better love
So darling, darling, feel better love
Feel better love

"Blood"
(live version)

Tryin' hard to recognise
Some pure motive inside of me
A creature that would horrify
Any child that I used to be
Oh, give no faith to show
Started to smile, so I showed my teeth
No more than flesh and bone
Doin' so much just to watch someone bleed

But I love the very blood of you
It keeps its heat in spite of you
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always

Tryin' hard, I nearly find
Innocence in spite of me
Oh, creature that would terrify
Any child left inside of me
Oh, that's a cold insight
Nothin' above us and nothin' below
Ahh, but you might be right
If there is no heaven and there is no soul

I just love the very blood of you
It keeps its heat in spite of you
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always

Always...

Oh, I love the very blood of you
It keeps its heat in spite of you
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always
Oh, I love the very blood of you
Leaks and squeeks you black and blue
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always

"Blood Upon The Snow"
(from "God Of War Ragnarok" soundtrack)

To all things housed in her silence
Nature offers a violence
The bear that keeps to his own line
The wolf that seeks always his own kind
The world that hardens as the harsher winter holds
The parent forced to eat its young before it grows

Every bird, gone unheard
Starving where the ground has froze
The winter sun rise, red on white
Like blood upon the snow
Like blood upon the snow

The ground walked here is a wonder
It ceases never to hunger
And all things nature's given
She takes all things back from the living

I've walked the earth and there are so few here that know
How dark the night
And just how cold the wind can blow
I've no more hunger now to see where the road will go
I've no more kept my warmth
Than blood upon the snow

Blood upon the snow
Blood upon the snow
Blood upon the snow

It's not my arms that will fail me
But this world takes more strength than it gave me
The trees deny themselves nothing that makes them grow
No rain fall, no sunshine
No blood upon the snow

Blood upon the snow
Blood upon the snow
Blood upon the snow

To all things housed in her silence
Nature offers a violence

"I Could Be Yours"

I could be soft and sweet
I could be hard and loud
I could be anything
You ever need somehow
Why don't you hear me sing
Out from the lost and found
I could be yours
I could be yours
I could be yours

Why don't you try on me
Why don't you take me home
I'll match the color scheme
Of your bedroom walls
Oh, take a dose of me
It doesn't hurt at all
I could be yours
I could be yours
I could be yours

Oh God, I'd benefit
From your sweet tenderness
Thank God it could've been
'Cause nothing comes from it
That'd be a helpful thought
If I could remember it, but
I could be yours
I could be yours
I could be yours

"Jackboot Jump (Live)"

At Standing Rock the Jackboot Jump
You'd swear was all the rage
Whether tearing up old treaties
Or just tearing up the place
It's always corporate infrastructure
Over the structure of your face

In Moscow the Jackboot show
Has so much in store
For any silly student
Who doesn't wanna learn the score
So the Moscow Jackboot Ballet
Finds some scared young dancing floor

In Hong Kong it won't be long
'Til they have to fall in line
For the long hand of Beijing
Stretching south a thousand miles
Where they rock the Jackboot Jump there
Like that shit's going out of style

All around the world
You'd think that things were looking rough
But the jackboot only jumps down
On people standing up
So you know good things are happening
When the jackboot needs to jump

"Swan Upon Leda"

A husband waits outside
A crying child pushes a child into the night
She was told he would come this time
Without leaving so much as a feather behind
To enact at last the perfect plan
One more sweet boy to be butchered by men

But the gateway to the world
Was still outside the reach of him
Would never belong to angels
Had never belonged to men
The swan upon Leda
Empire upon Jerusalem

A grandmother smuggling meds
Past where the god child-soldier Setanta stood dead
Our graceful turner of heads
Weaves through the checkpoints like a needle and thread
Someone's frightened boy waves her on
She offers a mother's smile and soon she's gone

The gateway to the world
The gun in a trembling hand
Where nature unmakes the boundary
The pillar of myth still stands
The swan upon Leda
Occupier upon ancient land

The gateway to the world
Was still outside the reach of him
Would never belong to angels
Had never belonged to men

"The Parting Glass"
(Live from the Late Late Show)

Of all the money that e'er I had
I've spent it in good company
And of all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas it was to none but me
For all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And of all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They'd wish me one more day to stay
But as it falls unto my lot
That I must go and you must not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all

"The Wages"

Although many contend
You may find hope ascend
To mark just how everything changes
Whether the temperature highs
Or the sea level rising
It's all going up but the wages

And murdered reporters
And talk of hard borders
Sky-bound as a heavenly choir
Or the stock price in Boeing
The screams of the dying
Or the skies over Yemen last night

It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time

Don't mention the rent
Or the money that's spent
Keeping the banks in good health
Or ridiculous claims
Or the level of blame
Pointed to anything else

And preachy musicians
And those stuck in prison
With scarcely enough for a blunt
Or the pressure of blood
That new hotel in the hood
With an oligarch's name on the front

It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up with the bump in the heating bills
Even though the city's on fire
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time

Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher

Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher

It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up with the bump in the heating bills
Even though the city's on fire
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time

"Through Me (The Flood)"

Picture a man
Seen like a speck out from the shore
Swimming out beyond the breakers like he's done his life before
He feels the coming of a squall will drag him out a greater length
But knows his strength
And tries to gather it

And he swims on
Turning back to shore again
Above the outer atmosphere of a world he's never seen
And looking down to his new home, he feels the rising of a wave
And knows at once he will not weather it

Like that man
I looked down into the depths when I met you
I couldn't measure it

Any time I've struggled on
Against the course
Out on my own
Every time I'd burn through the world, I'd see
That the world, it burns through me
But when I'd let go
My struggling form
My willing soul
Every time I'd flow through the world, I'd see
That the world, it flows through me
That the world, it flows through me

Picture a grave
Picture six feet freshly dug
The sharp temporary walls at the long-term cliff edge of the world
Light and air find some new deepness there and usher down the sky
Where one stands by and tries make sense of it

But try measure loss
Measure the silence of a house
The unheard footsteps at the doorway
The unemployment of the mouth
The waking up, having forgotten
And remembering again the full extent of what forever is

With each grave
I think of loss
And I can only think of you
And I couldn't measure it

Any time I've struggled on
Against the course
Out on my own
Every time I'd burn through the world, I'd see
That the world, it burns through me
But when I'd let go
My struggling form
My willing soul
Every time I'd flow through the world, I'd see
That the world, it flows through me
That the world, it flows through me

"Liquid Smooth"

I'm beautiful, I know 'cause it's the season
But what am I to do with all this beauty
Biology, I am an organism, I'm chemical
That's all, that is all

I'm liquid-smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid-smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall, capture me

Or at least take my picture

[Japanese "Kuzurete yuku mae ni"]
I'm pulsing, my blood is red and unafraid of living
Beginning to end

I'm liquid-smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid-smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall

How I feel this river rushing through my veins
With nowhere else to go, it circles 'round

I'm liquid-smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life
I'm in my prime
I'm liquid-smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe
About to fall, capture me

"Eric"

You like control, well, I do too
Take off my clothes and watch me move
You can come closer, I'll let you hurt me
How you choose

Help me with the zipper on my skirt, it's stuck
As you kneel, I'll be watching you fix me
This view of you, of the top of your head makes me forgive you

But how long, how long can we play this way
I'm tired, I'm tired of not loving you
My heart, my heart wants to hold you
But I know, I know, I know the rules

Blue light, dark room, the white of your teeth
As you smile at my trembling shoulders
But your skin, did you notice your skin
It cries a soft weep like mine

I'll sell, I'll sell my whole to you
What's my, what's my, what's my price
How 'bout, how 'bout just a part of you
'Cause I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want

"Brand New City"

One, two
Honey, what'd you take

Think my brain is rotting in places
I think my heart is ready to die
I think my body is falling in pieces
I think my blood is passing me by

Honey, what'd you take What'd you take
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take
Honey, what'd you take What'd you take
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take

I think my fate is losing its patience
I think the ground is pulling me down
I think my life is losing momentum
I think my ways are wearing me down

But if I gave up on being pretty, I wouldn't know how to be alive
I should move to a brand new city and teach myself how to die

Honey, what'd you take What'd you take
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take
Honey, what'd you take What'd you take
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take
Honey, what'd you take What'd you take
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take
Honey, what'd you take What'd you take
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take

"Real Men"

Real men don't need other people, and
Real men suck it in
Real men don't flinch or bleed in public
Oh, I think I'm a real man

Little boys cry and look around for comfort
And always get what they want
Little boys see toys and say, "I can take that"
Oh, you are my little boy

Though honestly, sir
All I wanna do is get naked in front of you
So you can look me up and down and tell me
"Well done, girl. You're looking good."

Real men keep cool in the face of a fire
Go down with the ship
And real men don't eat
'Cause they're above that, damn it
Oh, I'm gonna be a real man

Though honestly, sir
All I wanna do is get naked in front of you
So you can look me up and down
And give me your love for being so good

But little boys hold me, color me
Praise me, make me feel lovely
For a little while
So little boy, say you want me
'Cause, well, I can't take it
Go ahead
Do it, do it

"Wife"

You're home, you're home, you're home to me
So leave me, leave me, leave me a map
I'm here at my cliff looking down

I cannot bear you a son
But I will try
For if I am not yours, what am I
I daydream I'd give one a name of my own
For I, even I, even I am on loan

I have, I have, I watch a dream breaking
Breaking, breaking, breaking me
Away from my cliff, I am looking down from

I cannot bear you a son
I have tried
But if I am not yours, what am I
I daydream I'd give him a name of my own
For I, even mine, even mine is unknown

So let me go towards the morning star
With hope it won't disappear

"Bag Of Bones"

I'm all used up, pretty boy
Over and over again, my nail colors are wearing off
See my hands, pretty boy
What do they tell you
'Cause I've looked down at them, not knowing why
And after everything's done and I'm all undone
You can hear my high heels walking on
Clickety-clacking through the night
I'm carrying my bag of bones

Fluorescent store lights, you shine through the night
Illuminate my pores and you tear me apart
Mercy on me, would you please spare me tonight
I'm tired of this searching, would you let me let go

I know my room is a mess
Over and over again I tell myself I'll clean tomorrow
Just move the stuff up off the bed
And do what you came here to do
But first, open up a window for me
And let the cool air in, feel the night slip in
As it softly glides along your back
And I hope you leave right before the sun comes up
So I can watch it alone

Fluorescent store lights, you shine through the night
Illuminate my pores and you tear me apart
Mercy on me, would you please spare me tonight
I'm tired of this searching, would you let me let go

And I can take a little bit more
Let's shake this poet out of the beast
Just a, just a little bit more
Let's shake this poet out of the beast

"Door"

There is a door to me
I've never seen it
Sometimes I get closer to it
But I've never found it
At twilight, I almost had it
But then the night fell
I looked out at the dark and wondered
How could I have lost it

Then, one night, at the park I saw it
With my cheek in the dirt
I couldn't move underneath the dark
But at least I finally found it
Cried out a creak and opened
To show me what's beyond it
A hopeless violence
I named it "love"

"Pearl Diver"

Hmm
Hmm

Treasure hunter, you are dead
The light of the world is fading
You cannot see the other end
Your body's lost all feeling
Those creatures of your woken mind
Don't fear them or their hunger
Forgive the sea, follow the tide
With the monsters on your shoulder

Pearl diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver, dive, dive down
Pearl diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver, dive, dive down

Oh, hunter, if you didn't want
The beautiful so badly
Perhaps you would've found it
In your spirit singing softly
But hunter, you were human
Don't forget it and go safely
And I, I'll live without you
Though the struggle will be daily

Pearl diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver, dive, dive down
Pearl diver, dive, dive deeper
Pearl diver, dive, dive down

Oh, oh
Oh, ooh

Treasure hunter, you are dead
The light of the world is fading

"Goodbye, My Danish Sweetheart"

There's nobody better than you
It took me a while 'til I knew
But you knew from the start it was us, didn't you
It just took me a while 'til I knew

Now I lay as I study a blank wall
Would you spare me your voice if I call
'Cause you waited and watered my heart 'til it grew
You just grew a little smarter too

So I don't blame you if you want to
Bury me in your memory, I'm not the girl I ought to be, but
Maybe when you tell your friends, you
Can tell them what you saw in me, and not how I turned out to be

There's some kind of burning inside me
It's kept me from falling apart
And I'm sure that you've seen what it's done to my heart
But it's kept me from falling apart

Now here I lay, as I wonder about you
Would you just tell me what I'm meant to do
'Cause I've waited and watered my heart 'til it grew
You can see how it's blossomed for you

And I don't blame you if you want to
Bury me in your memory, I'm not the girl I ought to be, but
Maybe when you tell your friends, you
Can tell them what you saw in me, and not the way I am

And I don't mean to make your heart blue
But could we be what we're meant to be
I'm just about to beg you please, and
Then when you tell your friends, you can
Tell them what you saw in me, and
Not the way I used to be

'Cause there's nobody better than you

"Shame"

It feels so good
It feels so good
And right outside the door nobody knows
They're right outside the door and they don't know how it
Feels so good
It feels so good

I never was very good
I haven't been so good
But right outside the door nobody knows
They're right outside the door and they don't know how it
Feels so good
It feels so good

And I don't need anything other than you

"Because Dreaming Costs Money, My Dear"

I can still smell the fire
Though I know it's long died out
The smoke still hangs in my hair
And on some quiet evenings it burns my eyes

So darling, play your violin
I know it's what you live for
Darling, play your violin
We will manage somehow

I once lived in the sea
Bring me to your ear, you can hear
The tide where I used to be
Though now I'm but a shell
Oh, baby
Don't say sorry

Darling, play your violin
I know it's what you live for
Darling, play your violin
We will manage somehow

Don't dare regret anything
Remember what you're here for
You just play your violin
We will manage somehow

"Humpty"

I'll live in the bathtub
It's cool and clean
It's smooth and it's steady
It's all that I need

I broke our belongings
They're all on the floor
The room is now empty
Nothing left to throw

All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But they crack and crumble, it's all too much
Too frail for me to touch

All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But they crack and crumble, it's all too much
Too frail for me to touch

I'll live in the bathtub
Surrounded by tiles
All so square and so steady
I will die in their cool, cool arms

I broke what you gave me
But you kept giving more
And I'm sorry for taking
But I keep wanting more, more, more

All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But they crack and crumble, it's all too much
Too frail for me to touch

All the eggshells are on the ground
And I try, I'm trying to pick them up
But, Humpty Dumpty, you're much too much
Too frail for me to touch

Humpty Dumpty
It's much too much

All the eggshells are on the ground

"Circle"

There's a lie that I told to you
That now I can't tell the truth
And it ate me inside, so one soft drunken night
I slept with a man you knew

And in the morning I walked home alone
And the businessmen saw my bones
With my skirt in their eyes, they remembered the nights
When they were that man you knew

You told me once
You were happy to have me
But I never gave me away

There's the lie that I told to you

I would give you my heart, I think
But it's up in a branch of a tree
It was only to tease when he climbed up the tree
Put my heart where I couldn't reach

I didn't mind, I adored him so
We forgot, and we left for home
And that was so long ago, now the tree it has grown

And nobody knows my lover is buried underground
Nobody knows my lover is buried underground
Nobody knows my lover is buried underground

There's a lie that I told to you

"I Want You"

I want you
I hold one card
That I can't use
But I want you

You're coming back
And it's the end of the world
We're starting over
And I love you darling
And I am done, dear

You're in the house
And I am here in the car
I just need a quiet place
Where I can scream
How I love you

I found you
I found the door
But when I stepped through
There was no floor

You're coming back
And it's the end of the world
We're starting over
And I love you darling
And I am done, dear

You're in the house
And I am here in the car
I just need a quiet place
Where I can scream
How I love you

I want you
I want you

"Square"

Your room was square
I once noticed from there
In your bed, as you slept
And I held my breath
Everything had its own place
And I wondered what space would I take
In the order you kept

I tried to eat like your girlfriend
Just tea in the night, I'd end up
Too hungry to sleep
So lying awake, I would follow the aching inside
I would find
It's for you won't be mine

I tried my hardest, for I'd never learned
God's very simple and love shouldn't burn
And I would've offered you all that you yearned for
But I was still waiting for something to earn

What is that quiet of snow in the night
The dark rings with white noise
As you stand and drown
Maybe it's all of these snowflakes, screaming
A choir of mute
As they brace for the ground

Well, that's my ride
Hope you had a good night
You know, you made me happy
Here, shake my hand
You make such a good man
Never once did you know me

I tried my hardest, for how do you learn
God's very simple and love doesn't burn
And maybe you'd offered me all that I yearned for
But I was still waiting for something to earn

Silly me, waiting

"Strawberry Blond"

I love everybody
Because I love you
When you stood up
Walked away, barefoot
And the grass where you lay
Left a bed in your shape
I looked over it
And I ached

I love everybody
Because I love you
I don't need the city, and I
Don't need proof
All I need, darling
Is a life in your shape
I picture it, soft
And I ache

Look at you, strawberry blond

Reach out the car window
Trying to hold the wind
You tell me you love her
I give you a grin
Oh all I ever wanted was a
Life in your shape
So I follow the white lines
Follow the white lines
Keep my eyes on the road
As I ache

Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way

Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way

Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way

Isaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah
Isaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah

"Class Of 2013"

Mom, I'm tired
Can I sleep in your house tonight
Mom, is it alright
If I stay for a year or two
Mom, I'll be quiet
It would be just to sleep at night
And I'll leave once I figure out
How to pay for my own life too

Mom, would you wash my back
This once, and then we can forget
And I'll leave what I'm chasing
For the other girls to pursue

Mom, am I still young
Can I dream for a few months more

"Texas Reznikoff"

It's beautiful out today
I wish you could take me upstate
To the little place you would tell me about
When you'd sense that I'd want to escape

Texas is a land-locked state
It's a little bit far away
From the water, from the home that I've wanted to make
It somehow, in the city, you make it there and you make it
Anywhere, anywhere
But I've been anywhere and it's not what I want
I wanna be still with you

You keep your socks on in bed
Keep our hearth warm
"See the trees' shadows lie in black pools in the lawns"
You're the breeze in my Austin nights
You're the breeze in my Austin nights
You're the breeze in my Austin nights

"Townie"

There's a party and we're all going
And we're all growing up
Somebody's driving and he will be drinking
And no one's going back
'Cause we've tried hungry and we've tried full and
Nothing seems enough
So tonight, tonight
The boys are gonna go for
More more more

And I want a love that falls as fast
As a body from the balcony, and
I want to kiss like my heart is hitting the ground
I'm holding my breath with a baseball bat
Though I don't know what I'm waiting for
I am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be

Smell that, it's wet grass, and smoke in my hair
I think I've had enough
But he wants a finale and I came prepared
And we're not going back
And I've tried sharing and I've tried caring
And I've tried putting out
But the boys, boys, boys keep coming on for
More more more
And change, change, change is gonna come, but
When, when, when

And I want a love that falls as fast
As a body from the balcony, and
I want to kiss like my heart is chasing me down
I'm holding my breath with a baseball bat
Though I don't know what I'm waiting for
I am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be

And I want a love that falls as fast
As a body from the balcony, and
I want to kiss like my heart is hitting the ground
I'm holding my breath with a baseball bat
Though I don't know what I'm waiting for
I am not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be

I'm not gonna be what my daddy wants me to be
I wanna be what my body wants me to be

"First Love  Late Spring"

The black hole of the window where you sleep
The night breeze carries something sweet, a peach tree
Wild women don't get the blues
But I find that lately, I've been crying like a tall child

So please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me
Mune ga hachikire-sde
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me, "Don't," so I can crawl back in

And I was so young when I behaved twenty-five
Yet now, I find I've grown into a tall child
And I don't wanna go home yet
Let me walk to the top of the big night sky

Please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe
Please don't say you love me
Mune ga hachikire-sde
One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me, "Don't," so I can crawl back in

One word from you and I would
Jump off of this ledge I'm on, baby
Tell me, "Don't," so I can crawl back in
Please, hurry, leave me, I can't breathe

"Francis Forever"

I don't know what to do without you
I don't know where to put my hands
I've been trying to lay my head down
But I'm writing this at 3 AM

I don't need the world to see
That I've been the best I can be, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me

On sunny days, I go out walking
I end up on a tree-lined street
I look up at the gaps of sunlight
I miss you more than anything

I don't need the world to see
That I've been the best I can be, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me

And autumn comes when you're not yet done
With the summer passing by, but
I don't think I could stand to be
Where you don't see me

"I Don't Smoke"

I don't smoke
Except for when I'm missing you
To remember your mouth, how it
Tasted true
And I don't smoke
Except for after I've held you, baby
Being with you
Makes the flame burn good

So if you need to be mean
Be mean to me
I can take it and put it inside of me
If your hands need to break
More than trinkets in your room
You can lean on my arm
As you break my heart

I'm what's left of when we
Swam under the moon
Now the rest of my days are just
Waiting for when
You've calmed down and tell me
I was meant for you, baby
Being with you
Makes the flame burn good

If you need to be mean
Be mean to me
I can take it and put it inside of me
If your hands need to break
More than trinkets in your room
You can lean on my arm
As you break my heart

Just don't leave me alone
Wondering where you are
I am stronger than you give me
Credit for

If your hands need to break
More than trinkets in your room
You can lean on my arm
As you break my heart

"Jobless Monday"

It's a windy afternoon
Can't afford to buy my food
Or the drive I need to go
Further than they said I'd go

He only loves me when
There's a means he means to end
Oh I miss when we first met
He didn't know me yet

So take me out baby
Makes no difference where we'll be
As long as we're out in the sun
Take me out baby

Take me out baby
Doesn't matter where we'll be
But please under the light of day
Take me out
Take me out
Take me out baby
Take me out to

"Drunk Walk Home"

I will retire to the Salton Sea
At the age of 23
For I'm starting to learn I may never be free
But though I may never be free
Fuck you and your money
I'm tired of your money

And I sit on the curb 'cause it's the prettiest night
With no one else in sight
You know I wore this dress for you
These killer heels for you
See the dark, it moves
With every breath of the breeze

"I Will"

I will take good care of you
I will take good care of you
Everything you feel is good
If you would only let you
I will wash your hair at night
And dry it off with care
I will see your body bare
And still I will live here

So stay with me
Hold my hand
There's no need
To be brave

And all the quiet nights you bear
Seal them up with care
No one needs to know they're there
For I will hold them for you

'Cause all I ever wanted is here
All I ever wanted
All I want is
Always you
It's always you

And we're not out of the tunnel
I bet you, though, there's an end

Stay with me
Hold my hand
There's no need
To be brave

And while you sleep
I'll be scared
So by the time you wake
I'll be brave
I'll be brave
I'll be brave

"Carry Me Out"

At night
On the roof top
I untie my hair
And watch from my plastic chair
As my dark hair
Unleashes the night

The scent of flowers
Still in bloom from morning shower
And I
Say your name
In hopes you'll hear it in the stars

And carry me out
Carry me out

I drive when it rains
At night, when it rains, I drive
And the headlight spirits
They lead me down the Styx
So black it shines

And carry me out
Carry me out

At night
On the roof top
I untie my hair
And watch from my plastic chair
As my dark hair
Unleashes the night

"Last Words Of A Shooting Star"

All of this turbulence wasn't forecasted
Apologies from the intercom
And I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
They'll think of me kindly
When they come for my things
They'll never know how I'd stared at the dark in that room
With no thoughts
Like a blood-sniffing shark
And while my dreams made music in the night
Carefully
I was going to live

You wouldn't leave 'til we loved in the morning
You'd learned from movies how love ought to be
And you'd say you love me and look in my eyes
But I know through mine you were
Looking in yours
And did you know the Liberty Bell is a replica
Silently housed in its original walls
And while its dreams played music in the night
Quietly
It was told to believe

I always wanted to die clean and pretty
But I'd be too busy on working days
So I am relieved that the turbulence wasn't forecasted
I couldn't have changed anyways

I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
Goodbye

"Happy"

Happy came to visit me, he bought cookies on the way
I poured him tea, and he told me, "It'll all be okay"
Well, I told him I'd do anything to have him stay with me
So he laid me down, and I felt happy, come inside of me
He laid me down, and I felt happy

Oh, if you're going, take the train
So I can hear it rumble, one last rumble
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you

I was in the bathroom, I didn't hear him leave
I locked the door behind him, and I turned around to see
All the cookie wrappers and the empty cups of tea
Well, I sighed and mumbled to myself, "Again, I have to clean"
I sighed and mumbled to myself

If you're going, take the train
So I can hear it rumble, one last rumble
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you
And if you're going, take the moon
Then maybe I will see you, in the night I'll see you
And when you go, take this heart
I'll make no more use of it when there's no more you

"Dan The Dancer"

Dan had very long limbs
From leading day to day
Hanging onto a cliff
That stretched him everyday
And when she'd ask to hold hands
He would smile and
Let one of his hands go
His whole life in one hand
His whole life

When he'd say goodnight and
Leave her doorstep
He'd use his last strength
To wave back
And once back in his room
Once back in his room
He'd return his waving hand
Back to its cliff
He liked her more than life itself
I'm sure

'Cause Dan had never danced outside of his room
When no one was home and he would stop to hear the door
So when he moved with you
And felt his body let go
Of course you couldn't know
It was you and you alone
That he had shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
Shown his bedroom dancer to
And he would never tell you that it was his first time

"Once More To See You"

In the rear-view mirror
I saw the setting sun on your neck
And felt the taste of you bubble up inside me
But with everybody watching us
Our every move
We do have reputations
We keep it secret
Won't let them have it

So come inside and be with me
Alone with me
Alone
With me alone
If you would let me give you pinky-promise kisses
Then I wouldn't have to scream your name atop of every roof in the city of my heart
If I could see you
Once more to see you

Come inside and be with me
Alone with me
Alone
With me alone
If you would let me give you pinky-promise kisses
Then I wouldn't have to scream your name atop of every roof in the city of my heart
If I could see you
Once more to see you
If I could see you
Once more to see you

"Fireworks"

One morning, this sadness will fossilize
And I will forget how to cry
I'll keep going to work, and you won't see a change
Save, perhaps, a slight gray in my eye

I will go jogging routinely
Calmly and rhythmically run
And when I find that a knife's sticking out of my side
I'll pull it out without questioning why

And then, one warm summer night
I'll hear fireworks outside
And I'll listen to the memories as they cry, cry, cry

I will be married to silence
The gentleman won't say a word
But you know, oh, you know in the quiet he holds
Runs a river that will never find home

And then, one warm summer night
I'll hear fireworks outside
And I'll listen to the memories as they cry, cry, cry
Oh, one warm summer night
I'll hear fireworks outside
And I'll listen to the memories as they cry, cry, cry

Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry

"Your Best American Girl"

If I could, I'd be your little spoon
And kiss your fingers forevermore
But, big spoon, you have so much to do
And I have nothing ahead of me
You're the sun, you've never seen the night
But you hear its song from the morning birds
Well, I'm not the moon, I'm not even a star
But awake at night I'll be singing to the birds

Don't wait for me, I can't come

Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do, I think I do
And you're an all-American boy
I guess I couldn't help trying to be your best American girl

You're the one
You're all I ever wanted
I think I'll regret this

Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do, I finally do
And you're an all-American boy
I guess I couldn't help trying to be the best American girl
Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me
But I do, I think I do

"I Bet On Losing Dogs"

My baby, my baby
You're my baby, say it to me
Baby, my baby
Tell your baby that I'm your baby

I bet on losing dogs
I know they're losing and I pay for my place
By the ring
Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down
I'll be there on their side
I'm losing by their side

Will you let me, baby
Lose on losing dogs
I know they're losing and I pay for my place
By the ring
Where I'll be looking in their eyes when they're down

I wanna feel it
I bet on losing dogs
I always want you when I'm finally fine
How you'd be over me looking in my eyes when I come
Someone to watch me die
Someone to watch me die
I bet on losing dogs

Did you get that

"My Body's Made Of Crushed Little Stars"

I'm not doing anything
I'm not doing anything
My body's made of crushed little stars
And I'm not doing anything
I wanna see the whole world
I wanna see the whole world
I don't know how I'm gonna pay rent
I wanna see the whole world

Would you kill me, Jerusalem
Kill me, Jerusalem
Kill me, Jerusalem
Come find me

I better ace that interview
I better ace that interview
I should tell them that I'm not afraid to die
I better ace that interview

Uh
I work better under a deadline
I work better under a deadline
I pick an age when I'm gonna disappear
Until then I can try again
Until then I can try again

Kill me, Jerusalem
Kill me, Jerusalem
Kill me, Jerusalem
Go and kill me

"Thursday Girl"

Glory, glory, glory to the night that shows me what I am
As I go to the party on my knees
Saying, "Take it all, please..."

And tell me no
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Somebody, please
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Tell me no

Glory, glory, glory to the night
It shows me what I am (Glory)
I'm not happy or sad, just up or down
And always bad

Tell me no
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Somebody, please
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Tell me no
Somebody here
Tell me no, tell me no
Tell me no
Tell me no

"A Loving Feeling"

What do you do with a loving feeling
If the loving feeling makes you all alone
What do you do with a loving feeling
If they only love you when you're all alone

Holding hands under the table
Meeting up in your bedroom
Making love to other people
Telling each other it's all good
Kisses like pink cotton candy
Talking to everyone but me
I'm staying up late just in case you come up and ask to leave with me

What do you do with a loving feeling
If the loving feeling makes you all alone
What do you do with a loving feeling
If they only love you when you're all alone
What do you do with a loving feeling
If the loving feeling makes you all alone
What do you do with a loving feeling
If they only love you when you're all alone

You only love me when we're all alone

"Crack Baby"

Down empty streets sniffing glue, me and you
Blank, open eyes watch the moonflower bloom
It's been a long, hard, twenty-year summer vacation
All these twenty years trying to fill the void

Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you had it once
And you know that you want it back
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you're needing it
And you know that you need it bad

With wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones

Went to your room thinking, maybe, you'll feel something
But all I saw was your burning body waiting
All these twenty years on a vacation

Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you had it once
And you know that you want it back
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you're needing it
And you know that you need it bad
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you want it
Yeah, you know that you want it
You know that you
Crack baby, you don't know what you want
But you know that you need it
And you know that you need it bad

With wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones
Wild horses running through your hollow bones

"A Burning Hill"

Today, I will wear my white button-down
I'm tired of wanting more
I think I'm finally worn
For you have a way of promising things
And I've been a forest fire
I am a forest fire
And I am the fire, and I am the forest
And I am a witness watching it
I stand in a valley watching it
And you are not there at all

So today, I will wear my white button-down
I can at least be neat
Walk out and be seen as clean
And I'll go to work, and I'll go to sleep
And I'll love the littler things
I'll love some littler things

"Geyser"

You're my number one
You're the one I want
And I've turned down
Every hand that has beckoned me to come
You're my number one
You're the one I want
And I've turned down
Every hand that has beckoned me to come

'Cause you're the one I got
You're the one I got
So I'll keep turning down the hands
That beckon me to come

Though I'm a geyser, feel it bubbling from below
Hear it call, hear it call, hear it call to me, constantly
And hear the harmony only when it's harming me
It's not real, it's not real, it's not real enough

But I will be the one you need
The way I can't be without you
I will be the one you need
I just can't be without you

"Why Didn't You Stop Me"

I know that I ended it, but
Why won't you chase after me
You know me better than I do
So why didn't you stop me

Why didn't you stop me
Why didn't you stop me
And paint it over

I look for a picture of you
To keep in my pocket
But I can't seem to find one
Where you look how I remember

Look how I remember
Look how I remember
Paint it over

"Old Friend"

We nearly drowned
For such a silly thing
Someone who loves me now
Better than you
And that pretty friend is
Finally yours, and
I'll be around on Sunday, if

You'll meet me at Blue Diner
I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take anything you wanna give me, baby

I haven't told anyone
Just like we promised
Have you
Every time I drive through the city where you're from
I squeeze a little

Meet me at Blue Diner
I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take anything you wanna give me, baby
At Blue Diner, I'll take coffee and talk about nothing, baby
Blue Diner, I'll take anything you wanna give me, baby

"A Pearl"

You're growing tired of me
You love me so hard and I still can't sleep
You're growing tired of me
And all the things I don't talk about

Sorry, I don't want your touch
It's not that I don't want you
Sorry, I can't take your touch

It's just that I fell in love with a war
Nobody told me it ended
And it left a pearl in my head
And I roll it around
Every night, just to watch it glow
Every night, baby, that's where I go

Sorry, I don't want your touch
It's not that I don't want you
Sorry, I can't take your touch

There's a hole that you fill
You fill, you fill

But it's just that I fell in love with a war
And nobody told me it ended
And it left a pearl in my head
And I roll it around
Every night, just to watch it glow
Every night, baby, that's where I go
Just to watch it glow

"Lonesome Love"

I call you, to see you again
So I can win, and this can finally end
Spend an hour on my makeup
To prove something

Walk up in my high heels
All high and mighty
And you say, "Hello"
And I lose

'Cause nobody butters me up like you, and
Nobody fucks me like me

In the morning, in a taxi
I'm so very paying for
Why am I lonely for lonesome love
Why am I lonely for lonesome love
Why am I lonely

"Remember My Name"

I gave too much of my heart tonight
Can you come to where I'm staying and make some extra love
That I can save 'til tomorrow's show

'Cause I need somebody to remember my name
After all that I can do for them is done
I need someone to remember me

I need something bigger than the sky
Hold it in my arms and know it's mine
Just how many stars will I need to hang around me
To finally call it heaven

I need somebody to remember my name
After all that I can do for them is done
I need someone to remember me

I need something bigger than the sky
Hold it in my arms and know it's mine
Just how many stars will I need to hang around me
To finally get somewhere I can be all done
Somewhere like heaven

"Me And My Husband"

I steal a few breaths from the world for a minute
And then I'll be nothing forever
And all of my memories
And all of the things I have seen will be gone
With my eyes, with my body, with me

But me and my husband
We are doing better
It's always been just him and me
Together
So I bet all I have on that
Furrowed brow
And at least in this lifetime
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We're sticking together

And I'm the idiot with the painted face
In the corner, taking up space
But when he walks in, I am loved, I am loved

Me and my husband
We are doing better
It's always been just him and me
Together
So I bet all I have on that
Furrowed brow
And at least in this lifetime
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We're sticking together
Me and my husband
We are doing better

"Come Into The Water"

Come into the water
Do you wanna be my baby
Are you waiting to touch me
You look so good, but I keep my hands
'Til you come into the water

Maybe I'm the same as all those men
Writing songs of all they're dreaming
But would you tell me if you want me
'Cause I can't move until you show me

I didn't know I had a dream
I didn't know until I saw you
So would you tell me if you want me
'Cause I can't move until you show me

"Nobody"

My God, I'm so lonely
So I open the window
To hear sounds of people
To hear sounds of people

Venus, planet of love
Was destroyed by global warming
Did its people want too much too
Did its people want too much

And I don't want your pity
I just want somebody near me
Guess I'm a coward
I just want to feel alright

And I know no one will save me
I just need someone to kiss
Give me one good honest kiss
And I'll be alright

Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody, nobody

I've been big and small and
Big and small and
Big and small again
And still nobody wants me
Still nobody wants me

And I know no one will save me
I'm just asking for a kiss
Give me one good movie kiss
And I'll be alright

Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Ooh, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody, no

"Pink In The Night"

I glow pink in the night in my room
I've been blossoming alone over you
And I hear my heart breaking tonight
I hear my heart breaking tonight
Do you hear it too
It's like a summer shower
With every drop of rain singing
"I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you
I love you, I love you, I love you"

I could stare at your back all day
I could stare at your back all day
And I know I've kissed you before, but
I didn't do it right
Can I try again, try again, try again
Try again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again

"A Horse Named Cold Air"

A lake with no fish
Is the heart of a horse
Named Cold Air
Who, when young
Would run like a storm
They would say

I thought I'd traveled a long way
But I had circled
The same old sin

"Washing Machine Heart"

Toss your dirty shoes in my washing-machine heart
Baby, bang it up inside
I'm not wearing my usual lipstick
I thought maybe we would kiss tonight
Baby, will you kiss me already, and
Toss your dirty shoes in my washing-machine heart
Baby, bang it up inside

Baby, though I've closed my eyes
I know who you pretend I am
I know who you pretend I am

But do mi ti
Why not me
Why not me
Do mi ti
Why not me
Why not me
Do mi ti
Why not me
Why not me

"Blue Light"

Somebody kiss me, I'm going crazy
I'm walking 'round the house naked
Silver in the night
Singing, "Do-do, do-do..."

Out there I'm a sharp knife
Are you that blue light
Are you that blue light
Are you that blue light
Are you

"Do-do, do-do..."

"Two Slow Dancers"

Does it smell like a school gymnasium in here
It's funny how they're all the same
It's funny how you always remember
And we've both done it all a hundred times before
It's funny how I still forgot

It would be a hundred times easier
If we were young again
But as it is
And it is
We're just two slow dancers, last ones out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out

And the ground has been slowly pulling us back down
You see it on both our skin
We get a few years and then it wants us back

It would be a hundred times easier
If we were young again
But as it is
And it is
To think that we could stay the same
To think that we could stay the same
To think that we could stay the same
But we're two slow dancers, last ones out
We're two slow dancers, last ones out
Two slow dancers, last ones out

"Valentine, Texas"

Let's step carefully into the dark
Once we're in, I'll remember my way around
Who will I be tonight
Who will I become tonight
I'll show you who my sweetheart's never met
Wet teeth, shining eyes
Glimmering by a fire

Let's drive out to where dust devils are made
By dancing ghosts as they kick up clouds of sand
Where clouds look like mountains
Clouds look like mountains
Let me watch those mountains from underneath
And maybe they'll finally float off of me

"Working For The Knife"

I cry at the start of every movie
I guess 'cause I wish I was making things too
But I'm working for the knife

I used to think I would tell stories
But nobody cared for the stories I had about
No good guys

I always knew the world moves on
I just didn't know it would go without me
I start the day high and it ends so low
'Cause I'm working for the knife

I used to think I'd be done by 20
Now at 29 the road ahead appears the same
Though maybe at 30 I'll see a way to change
That I'm living for the knife

I always thought the choice was mine
And I was right but I just chose wrong
I start the day lying and end with the truth
That I'm dying for the knife

"Stay Soft"

Fury, pure and silver
You grip it tight inside
Like a knife
It glints in your eye

It's why I've arrived, your sex god
Here to take you where
You need to go
To where the dark remembers you

Open up your heart
Like the gates of hell

You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up

I am face down on my bed
Still not quite awake yet
Thinking of you
I tuck my hand under my weight

Just tell me what you want to do
Tell me what you want
To burn away
'Cause I could be your stoker

Open up your heart
Like the gates of hell

You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up

You stay soft, get beaten
Only natural to harden up
You stay soft, get eaten
Only natural to harden up

Only natural to harden up

"Everyone"

Everyone, all of them
Everyone said don't go that way
So, of course, to that I said
I think I'll go that way

And I left the door open to the dark
I said come in, come in, whatever you are
But it didn't want me yet

Then like a babe in a crib
After some big hand turns out the light
And I opened my arms wide to the dark
I said take it all, whatever you want
I didn't know that I was young
I didn't know what it would take
I didn't know what it would take

Sometimes I think I am free
Until I find I'm back in line again

"Heat Lightning"

Heat lightning
Running outside the window
I've laid awake since 100 and, now, it's 4 o'clock
Though I've held on
Can't carry it much longer
On the ceiling dancing are the things all come and gone

And there's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
So, I give it up to you
I hope that's okay
There's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
I give it up to you
I surrender

Heat lightning
Watch it from my doorstep
Sleeping eyelid of the sky
Flutters in a dream
Well I've held on
But feel a storm approaching
Trees are swaying in the wind like sea anemones

And there's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
Can I give it up to you
Would that be okay
There's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
I give it up to you
I surrender

There's nothing I can do
Not much I can change
I give it up to you
I surrender

"The Only Heartbreaker"

If you would just make one mistake
What a relief that would be
But I think for as long as we're together
I'll be the only heartbreaker

I'll be the only heartbreaker
I'll be the only heartbreaker

So I'll be the loser in this game
I'll be the bad guy in the play
I'll be the water main that's burst and flooding
You'll be by the window, only watching

I'll be the only heartbreaker
I'll be the only heartbreaker

(I apologize)
(You forgive me)
(I apologize)
(You forgive me)

And make me the only heartbreaker
So I'll be the only heartbreaker

"Love Me More"

If I keep myself at home
I won't make the same mistake
That I made for fifteen years
I could be a new girl
I will be a new girl

I wish that this would go away
But when I'm done singing this song
I will have to find something else
To do to keep me here
Something else to keep me here

Here's my hand
There's the itch
But I'm not supposed to scratch

I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to fill me up
Fill me up, fill me full up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to drown it out
Drown it out, drown me out

How do other people live
I wonder how they keep it up
When today is finally done
There's another day to come
Then another day to come
Then another day to

Come back to mine
We'll pretend it ends tomorrow

I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to fill me up
Fill me up, fill me full up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to drown it out
Drown it out, drown me out

I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more
Love enough to clean me up
Clean me up, clean me up
Clean me up, clean me up
Clean me up, clean me up
I need you to love me more
Love me more, love me more

"There's Nothing Left Here For You"

There's nothing left for you
Nothing in this room
Try and go outside
Nothing waits for you

You had it once before
Not anymore
So go on to that sweetheart's door
And find a new you

Give her all the love
You saved for it

You could touch fire
You could fly
It was your right
It was your life

And then it passed
To someone new
It'll keep passing on
Long after you

But you're the only one
She's counting on

There's nothing left for you

"Should've Been Me"

Well I went through my list of friends and found
I had no one to tell
Of this overwhelming clean feeling
Strange serenity

When I saw the girl looked just like me
And it broke my heart, the lengths you went
To hold me
To get to have me, 'cause

I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
So you went into your memory
Relived all the ways you still want me
I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
I'm sorry it should've been me

I'd be going 'bout my day until a hand
Would come and lift me out
And drop me in the middle of a labyrinth
Where I'd be stuck a while

When I saw the girl looked just like me, I thought
Must be lonely loving someone
Trying to find their way out of a maze
Oh I know

I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
So you went into your memory
Relived all the ways you still want me
I haven't given you what you need
You wanted me but couldn't reach me
I'm sorry it should've been me
I'm sorry it should've been me

"I Guess"

I guess, I guess
I guess this is the end
I'll have to learn
To be somebody else

It's been you and me
Since before I was me
Without you I don't yet know
Quite how to live

If I could keep
Anything of you
I would keep
Just this quiet after you

It's still as a pond
I am staring into
From here I can say
Thank you
From here I can tell you
Thank you

"That's Our Lamp"

We fought again
I ran out the apartment
You say you love me
I believe you do
But I walk down and up and down
And up and down this street
'Cause you just don't like me
Not like you used to

That's our lamp
It shines like a big moon
We may be ending
I'm standing in the dark
Looking up into our room
Where you'll be waiting for me
Thinking that's where you loved me
That's where you loved me

Thinking that's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me
That's where you loved me

"Glide (Lily Chou-Chou)"

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like a melody
Just like a simple sound
Like in harmony

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like the sky
Just fly so far away
To another place

To be away from all
To be one
Of everything

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like the wind
Just flowing in the air
Through an open space

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like the sea
Just swaying in the water
So to be at ease

To be away from all
To be one
Of everything

I wanna be
I wanna be
I wanna be just like a melody
Just like a simple sound
Like in harmony

"Bug Like An Angel"

There's a bug like an angel
Stuck to the bottom
Of my glass, with a little bit left
As I got older
I learned I'm a drinker
Sometimes a drink feels like family
Family

Hey, what's the matter
Lookin' like your sticker
Is stuck on a floor somewhere
Did you go and make promises you can't keep
Well, when you break them
They break you right back
Amateur mistake
You can take it from me
They break you right back
Break you right back

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

When I'm bent over
Wishin' it was over
Makin' all variety of vows I'll never keep
I try to remember
The wrath of the devil
Was also given him by God
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

"Buffalo Replaced"

Mosquitoes can enjoy me, I can't go inside
I'm suckin' up as much of the full moon, so bright
Fireflies zoomin' through the yard like highway cars
Someone out here burnin' something, kids feelin' alive

Freight train stampedin' through my backyard
It'll run across the plains like the new buffalo replaced

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I have a hope and though she's blind with no name
She shits where she's supposed to, feeds herself while I'm away
Sometimes I think it would be easier without her
But I know nothing can hurt me when I see her sleepin' face

Freight train horn howlin' out mad and wild
Headin' somewhere far away like the new buffalo replaced

Oooh, ahhh
Ooh, ooh

"Heaven"

All of our love
Fillin' all of our room
Your low warm voice
Curses as you find the string
To strike within me
That rings out a note
Heard in heaven

Heaven
Heaven

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Now I bend like a willow
Thinkin' of you
Like a murmurin' brook
Curvin' about you
As I sip on the rest of the coffee you left
A kiss left of you

Heaven
Heaven
Heaven

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Hear the storm
Dances outside
Something set free
Is runnin' through the night
And the dark awaits us
All around the corner
But here in our place
We have for the day
Can we stay awhile and listen for

Heaven
Heaven

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

"I Don't Like My Mind"

I don't like my mind, I don't like being left alone in a room
With all its opinions about the things that I've done
So, yeah, I blast music loud, and I work myself to the bone
And on an inconvenient Christmas, I eat a cake

A whole cake, all for me
Ooh, aah

And then I get sick and throw up and there's another memory that gets stuck
Inside the walls of my skull waiting for its turn to talk
And it may be a few years, but you can bet it's there, waiting still
For me to be left alone in a room full of things that I've done

A whole cake, so please don't take
Take this job from me
A whole cake, so please don't take
Take my job from me

"The Deal"

There's a deal you can make on a midnight walk alone
Look around, listen close, hear it fall from above
It will ask what you'd give and what you'd take for it in return
I once went on such walk and I found that I'd said

I want someone to take this soul
I can't bear to keep it
I'd give it just to give
And all I will take are the consequences
Will somebody take this soul

Then, of course, nothing replied, nothing speaks to you in the night
And I walked my way home, there was no one in sight
Save a bird perched upon a streetlight, watchin' me
So, I stopped and let it watch 'til I found that it said

Now I'm taken, the night has me
You won't hear me singin'
You're a cage without me
Your pain is eased but you'll never be free, for
Now I'm taken, the night has me

There's a deal that I made
There's a deal that I made
There's a deal that I made
There's a deal

"When Memories Snow"

When memories snow
And cover up the driveway
I shovel all those memories
Clear the path to drive to the store
And when memories melt
I hear them in the drainpipe
Drippin' through the downspout
As I lie awake in the dark

And if I break
Could I go on break
Be back in my room
Writin' speeches in my head
Listenin' to the thousand hands
That clap for me in the dark

"My Love Mine All Mine"

Moon, a hole of light
Through the big top tent up high
Here before and after me
Shinin' down on me
Moon, tell me if I could
Send up my heart to you
So, when I die, which I must do
Could it shine down here with you

'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine

My baby here on earth
Showed me what my heart was worth
So, when it comes to be my turn
Could you shine it down here for her

'Cause my love is mine, all mine
I love, my, my, mine
Nothing in the world belongs to me
But my love, mine, all mine
Nothing in the world is mine for free
But my love, mine, all mine, all mine

"The Frost"

The frost, it looks like dust
Settled on the world
After everyone's long been gone
But me, I was hidin', or forgotten
The only one left
Now the world is mine alone
With no one, no one to share the memory
Of frost out the window this morning
After you're gone
And the house is mine alone

You're my best friend
Now I've no one to tell
How I lost my best friend
The frost, it looks
Like we've been left in the attic
But you're not here to see
It's just witness-less me

"Star"

Remember when we met
We acted like two fools
We were so glad
So glad to have found it

That love is like a star, it's gone
We just see it shining
It's traveled very far, I'll
Keep a leftover light burning
So you can keep looking up
Isn't that worth holding on

You know I'd always been alone
Till you taught me
To live for somebody

That love is like a star
It's gone, we just see it shining
'Cause it's traveled very far, I'll
Keep a leftover light burning
So you can keep looking up
I am yours

No matter that love's gone
We just see it shining
We've traveled very far, I'll
Keep a leftover light burning
So you can keep looking up
Isn't that worth holding on

"I'm Your Man"

You're an angel, I'm a dog
Or you're a dog and I'm your man
You believe me like a God
I destroy you like I am

I'm sorry I'm the one you love
No-one will ever love me like you again
So when you leave me, I should die
I deserve it, don't I

I can feel it getting near
Like flashlights coming down the way
One day you'll figure me out
I'll meet judgement by the hounds

People always gave me love
Others were never to blame after all
You believe me like a God
I betray you like a man

"I Love Me After You"

Hmm
Hmm
Hmm

Brushin' my hair naked
Spritz my face with toner
Splash water on my neck
Laughin' in the mirror
Cool water in a glass
Drink it down
How I love me after you
King of all the land

Stride through the house naked
Don't even care that the
Curtains are open
Let the darkness see me
Streets are mine, the night is mine
All my own
How I love me after you
King of all the land
I'm king of all the land

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

"Between The Breaths"
(from "How to Talk to Girls at Parties" soundtrack)

As you look to the stars
Oh, you could find
Illuminated in scars
A face aligned
I am saving the space
Between the breaths
I am making your place
Between the breaths

As the flame is to snow
First love to last
I will laugh in your face
Like shattered glass
I'm saving the space
Between the breaths
We are saving a place
Between the breaths

Between the breaths
Between the breaths
Between the breaths
Between the breaths
I've seen it
Oh, and I'll breathe it
I've seen it
Oh, and I'll breathe it
(Between the breaths)

I never said where I came from
You never asked what I was made of
You didn't need to know
You already know
I said it even so
You didn't need to know
You never said you couldn't see me
Never a hint you couldn't be me
I could never say
I didn't need to say
Now I'm fine although
It was touch-and-go

Counting the breaths
Until you
Oh, la la
Oh, la la
Oh, la la
Oh, la la

The distance between us
Solved by a shrug
Just a shrug of dark matter
Just a shrug of dark matter

You thought you saw a new star
You caught a fright
You think you wish you may
You wish you might
Be saving the space
Between the breaths
We are saving a place
Between the breaths

I've seen it
Oh, and I'll breathe it
I've seen it
Oh, and I'll breathe it
Between the breaths
Between the breaths
Between the breaths

You never said you couldn't see me
Never a hint you couldn't be me
I could never say
I didn't need to say
I said it even though
You didn't need to know

A sky full of messages
Sealed up in bottles
Smash the omens
Our days are not numbered
Scream in my mouth
I'll barely hear you

Flame to snow
First love to last
Brand on brow
First love to now
Questions posed
Uncut the throat
You don't have to ask
First love to last

Let's meet at the same time
Every night
Starlight on skin
Is a million years old
You never asked my age.
You never questioned my rage
Let's meet at the same time
Every morning
The blood in my gut
Is a thousand years old
But you are the sweetest infection
You are the sweetest infection

I could never know
I didn't need to know
You said it even though
You could never know

Oh, no no oh
Oh, no no oh
Oh, no no oh

"Home Alone"

I'm awake
Can you see me now
And if you stay
We can lounge about
And I'm getting tired
But you make me feel awake
And at the end of the night
Maybe we can stay up late

'Cause I'm just all alone
Sitting at home
And you should stay
If you don't mind
I'll be okay
If you stay
'Cause you should stay
If you don't mind

On my own
I miss you here
Sun is gone
And the clouds are near
And I'm getting tired of being
By myself
'Cause at the end of the night
Maybe you can help yourself

'Cause I'm just all alone
Sitting at home
And you should stay
If you don't mind
I'll be okay
If you stay
'Cause you should stay
If you don't mind

I'm just all alone
Sitting at home
And you should stay
If you don't mind
I'll be okay
If you stay
'Cause you should stay
If you don't mind

"Bobby"

Bobby was fourteen when she knew
Nothing would last
Wishing her life wouldn't be this bad
'Cause Bobby always thought like this with her thought of having missed
Every little thing life could bring she dismissed
'Cause Bobby always saw the bad onto the life she had
Who could have blamed the girl
Bobby was fourteen years old, Bobby was fourteen years old

Bobby was fourteen when she knew
Nothing would last
Wishing her mind didn't think so sad
'Cause Bobby always had a stitch on the left side of her wrist
Despite the love she'd get she dismissed
'Cause Bobby always saw the bad onto the life she had
Who could have blamed the girl
Bobby was fourteen years old, Bobby was fourteen years old

And Bobby knew if she'd ended it all it would be better soon
And if she tried, she would've missed out being happy and be a fool
But deep down bobby knew she'd find someone like you

Bobby was fifteen when she knew
Something's would last
Wishing her mind never thought that bad
'Cause bobby still had the stitch on the left side of her wrist
She got all life could give that she'd missed

"Spacing Out"

Can't you see
Can't you notice
Somehow tough and I'm pretty broken
Just because I'm fine doesnt mean I'm alright
And I need someone to say okay
I need someone to say It's fine

I'm just stressing out
I need something to hold me
I need something to hold me
I'm just spacing out
I need something to catch me
I need something to catch me

Are you dumb are you stupid
Is it me or is it pretty obvious
Just because I don't talk doesn't mean I go talking
'Cause sometimes I keep to myself
And sometimes it's helps with my friend

I'm just stressing out
I need something to hold me
I need something to hold me
I'm just spacing out
I need something to catch me
I need something to catch me
I'm just stressing out
I need something to hold me
I need something to hold me

"Angry Song"

Pick up the phone
Please, tell me you're home
The monsters are gone
The wardrobe is closed
Where's my guitar
They hate when I sing
So, fuck my guitar, yeah
Fuck everything

Mmmm mmmm [x2]

String's on a twist
My ass they can kiss
They're making me sick
Just, go suck my dick
No, singing past ten
You can't stay in your bed
So, fuck mom and dad
I'm going real mad

Mmmm mmmm [x4]

"Everest"

You're alright, you're still breathing
Even though you feel dead sometimes
You'll be fine, you're still eating
Even though it doesn't last sometimes

'Cause even if your eyes are black
Your bones are always gold
'Cause it's climbed up every mountain
That no story's ever told
'Cause even if your bags are packed
You'll never leave your home
'Cause you're scared of all the monsters
That are waiting to unfold

Blank noise is an awful sound
And it hurts my ears, I don't know how
My name's just a silhouette
Hiding under all the self-doubt

'Cause even if your eyes are black
Your bones are always gold
'Cause it's climbed up every mountain
That no story's ever told
'Cause even if your bags are packed
You'll never leave your home
'Cause you're scared of all the monsters
That are waiting to unfold

Boy, I'm scared
Boy, I'm scared
Boy, I'm scared
Boy, I'm scared

"Tired"

You haven't been good for long
Is it the sound of your own thoughts
That always keeps you up at night
Maybe it's time to say goodbye
'Cause I'm getting pretty fucking tired

You haven't felt right for days
Is it the fact you never say
What comes in your mind that day
Maybe it's time to shut away
'Cause I've never really felt okay

'Cause I've been eating less all day
To give my brain some extra space to think
'Bout all the things to do to help
Distract me from the rude of heart

"Dance With Me"

If you wanna dance then
Dance with me
It's pretty fast but
This is what you do at parties, right

And I know it's hard to tell
But I think I really like you

Just take it slow
And move your feet to the beat
'Cause if we dance then
You don't have to speak

And I know it's hard to tell
But I think I really like you

"Art Class"

You look pretty good today
Is it me or did you shave
Good, you've been looking at me twice as more
So I can see your face
You sit across from me, in the classroom
But do you even know my name
If you want to ask me how I am
Don't hesitate

'Cause you're my cru- cru- crush
And I like you very much
And I'd appreciate
If you'd like me back
But it's okay, 'cause you make my heart
In art class
In art class

Why do you always stick to smiling
And sit still being so quiet
I've been pretty distracted for some days
And it's ruining my diet
If you don't take the hint already
I'm afraid I'll start a riot
'Cause you make my whole world go crazy
Yeah your smell just sends me flying

'Cause you're my cru- cru- crush
And I like you very much
And I'd appreciate
If you'd like me back
But it's okay, 'cause you make my heart
In art class
In art class

All my days
Been trying to find a reason to stay
Say my name
And I'll go ahead and pick a date
I'm okay
If you understand that this is fate

Art class
Art class
Art class
Art class

"If You Want To"

If you wanna take me
Go ahead and try my head
Experience is nothing compared to
The sleep paralysis in my bed
If you wanna love me
Try to get inside my brain
Experience is nothing compared to
The nights I'm always up so late

Bed bugs in my mind
Keep them all alive
Insomnia creeps at night
Sleep paralysis till I die
Die

'Cause if you want, you could stay with me in my bed
If you want to, only if you want to
If you want, you could go ahead and fix my head
If you want to, only if you want to

If you wanted to
If you try to

Wishing I still had my dreams
Late night started, take up space
'Cause every time I try to remember
Lack of sleep takes half my brain

Bed bugs in my mind
Keep them all alive
Insomnia creeps at night
Sleep paralysis till I die
Die

'Cause if you want, you could stay with me in my bed
If you want to, only if you want to
If you want, you could go ahead and fix my head
If you want to, only if you want to
Use some pesticides and throw it in my brain
If you want to, only if you want to
Bed bugs keep me up at night and I'm going insane
If they try to, only if they try to

If you wanted to
If you try to

'Cause if you want, you could stay with me in my bed
If you want to, only if you want to
If you want, you could go ahead and fix my head
If you want to, only if you want to
Use some pesticides and throw it in my brain
If you want to, only if you want to
Bed bugs keep me up at night and I'm going insane
If they try to, only if they try to

"Eighteen"

Don't wanna be eighteen with responsibilities
Sometimes I get scared of growing up
Entering a world with broken dreams
Sometimes I get scared and throw it all up

And June the third is
Coming closer and I'm
Nowhere near closure

Don't wanna be eighteen when I can't ride a bike
Still hang onto my sheets during storms
In my bed I'm ten but I can't shut my eyes
I still wish I wore a school uniform

And June the third is
Coming closer and I'm
Nowhere near closure

Don't wanna be eighteen with a messy room
Still wonder what lingers under my bed at night
Kinda wish I stayed at my mother's home
Are we gonna know what it's like to be blind

'Cause June the third is
Coming closer and I'm
Nowhere near closure

"The Way I Spoke"

Think I saw you on the bus just yesterday
Wearing that blue shirt you said you liked that day
The image now is just blurred in my mind

But do you recall the time we talked
The day you held my hand
We were by a station
The sky was dark in sight
The moon was out but the sun was in your eyes
No one talked but I did
You listened
You said you liked the way I spoke

I think I saw you in my dream last night
It was cold with lots of pretty lights
The image now is just blurred in my mind

But do you recall the time we talked
The day you kissed me
We were by an archway
With flowers cascading round the roof
Standing under my winter coat to shelter us
You said you liked the way I spoke

And if you'd like to hold my hand
It would bring back all the things we had
And if God were to take that all away
Wouldn't that be a shame

"Disappear"

Kiss me on my neck
Tell me all your fears
'Cause the rush of love is gone
I'm tryna find out why it disappeared
Why it disappeared

I look you in the eyes
Don't feel nothing here
'Cause the feeling of the love that I used to have
Well that shit's disappeared
Yeah that shit's disappeared
Yeah that shit's disappeared
Yeah that shit's disappeared
Yeah that shit's disappeared

Do you remember
Our love in November
That shit was so real
But there's patches on my fingers that won't heal
There's patches on my fingers that won't feel
Why'd you have to fucking disappear
Why'd you have to fucking disappear
Why'd you disappear
Why'd you disappear
Why'd you disappear
Why'd you disappear

Please come back
Please come back
Please come back
Please come back

"1999"

Hold me close and say you care
Because I'm in love with your brown hair
The way you touch me is a curse
And I'm not willing to let it hurt

Watch your mouth and wash with soap
Because I just hate the way you spoke
Green eyes make everything feel numb
So I'm not willing to give it all up

And I'm not wasting time again
Closure instead of sex
I'm not wasting time again

You said I fucked up and ruined your life
Little did you know you ruined
Mine

"Apple Cider"

We both like apple cider
But your hair be smelling like fruit punch
And I don't even like you that much
Wait
I do
FUCK

Call me
At midnight
Let's give this
Thing a try

You said you liked my hair
So go ahead and touch it
You said you liked the jumper I wore
So I always wore it
It's really nice to talk to you
It's really nice to hold your hand
It's really nice to talk to you
It's really nice to hold your hand
And even if we're just friends
We could be more than that
And even if we're just friends
We could be more than that

So call me
At midnight
Let's give this thing
A try

Call me
At midnight
Let's give this thing
A try

So call me
At midnight
Ask if it's alright
To have a sleepover
To drink some apple cider
Or maybe some fruit punch
And we can talk about how we don't like each other that much

"Ceilings"

Love me like a garden filled with flowers
Like the driest desert in the rain
Love me like cigarettes in Paris
Love me like a book that has no name

Let the birds sing
Let the fish swim
And appreciate the life you live

Miss me like the scent of your first room
The thing you've always wanted to go back to
Ceilings were so high when you were five
Miss me like the way your mother misses your height

Let the birds sing
Let the fish swim
And appreciate the life you live

"Angel"

White angel come
Intoxicate my blood
Just another hit
You'd get used to it
Just another grit

Your bones are only painted gold
That's why it rots beneath your soul
You're not as brave as you may seem
That's why it hurts me

I'm scared of life
It's in my blood
So I blame myself
I blame myself
I blame myself
White pretty snowflakes
White pretty snowflakes
White pretty snowflakes
Falling on my face

Your bones are only painted gold
That's why it rots beneath your soul
You're not as brave as you may seem
That's why it hurts me

"You Lie All the Time"

You lie all the time
Yeah you do
But I can't complain
'Cause I'm just afraid of losing you

You don't understand
Yeah you don't
'Cause if I explained
You'd just hate the way it goes

So tell me it's okay
That everything is great
'Cause I just hate the fact
That every time we do
You look the other way

You say it's alright
Yeah you do
But it's fine
'Cause you hate to see me cry
Cry
Cry

So tell me it's okay
That everything is great
'Cause I just hate the fact
That every time we do
You look the other way

And if you ask me
What I'd wanna do
I'd look you in the eyes
And end up asking you (oh)
You (oh)
Oh you
Oh you

"Soren"

Miss your hair
I like the way you stare
Into my eyes
Most the time
The way you touch me
Is like a curse that can't be broken
But it hurts
Most the time

And if there was a place
That I had to choose
Or a memory that fades
That I cannot lose
If there was a place
That I could call home
Before I'd die you'd ought to know
It would be in your arms tonight

The green in your eyes
Are like the leaves in the summer
And it changes
With the weather
The pink in your cheeks
When you slightly loose your temper
Makes me love you
Even more

And if there was a place
That I had to choose
Or a memory that fades
That I cannot lose
If there was a place
That I could call home
Before I'd die you'd ought to know
It would be in your arms tonight
It'd be in your arms tonight
It'd be in your arms tonight

"Are You Sure"

You say you understand
Are you sure, are you sure
You say you've been to Mars before
Are you sure, are you sure

It's funny for you
My state stays the same in outer space
It's funny for you
It's obvious you've never felt this way
It's pretty shit
My brain's alone and no one understands

You think you know my brain
Are you sure, are you sure
You think you know just what to say
Are you sure, are you sure

It's funny for you
My state stays the same in outer space
It's funny for you
It's obvious you've never felt this way
It's pretty shit
My brain's alone and no one understands

So talk to me again
You seem to understand
You claim to say its fine
But you never really know where I am
Why
Why
Why
Why

It's funny for you
My state stays the same in outer space
It's funny for you
It's obvious you've never felt this way
It's pretty shit
My brain's alone and no one understands

"I Wish I Was Stephen Malkmus"

Think I'm starting to change
With the weeks and the days
Got this new blue-haired phase

I think I kinda like it, think I kinda like it
Yeah

Think I kinda like it
'Cause I get tired of the same shit
Got new hair, a new phase
I'm from outer space
And I'm pretty sure I'll get used to it

Guess I'm tryna get by
'Cause like the weather, I change with time

And I sit at home, cry to Pavement
I wish I was Stephen Malkmus
I wanted change, no one forced it
My hair is blue, it's pretty obvious
That I kinda like it, think I kinda like it
Yeah

Think I kinda like it
'Cause I get tired of the same shit
Got new hair, a new phase
I'm from outer space
And I'm pretty sure I'll get used to it

Now I've changed, I've been feeling comfy
But now I've changed, I've been feeling lonely
'Cause your photos suck, your brand is shit
You're up your butt
You never really ask me how I am, ask me how I am

'Cause I sit at home, cry to Pavement
I wish I was Stephen Malkmus
I wanted change, no one forced it
My hair is blue, it's pretty obvious
That I kinda like it, think I kinda like it
Nice

Think I kinda like it
'Cause I get tired of the same shit
Got new hair, a new phase
I'm from outer space
And I'm pretty sure I'll get used to it

Fuck

"Sun More Often"

Keep your head down low
Cause is it the sound, or is it the way things go
In your head you're scared
So just sing along to the song in end

Cause if you try to ask me how
You'll never know what to expect how to get up
You should go out and see the sun more often
You should go out and see the sun more often

If you tried you'll see
That the world's not as scary as it seems

Cause if you try to ask me how
You'll never know what to expect how to get up
You should go out and see the sun more often
You should go out and see the sun more often

Go out and see the sun more often
Go out and see the sun more often
Go out and see the sun

Go out and see the sun more often
Go out and see the sun more often
Go out and see the sun more often

"She Plays Bass"

Hey, won't you call me back
'Cause I've been waiting for a text back
It hurts my brain
This chick who plays bass

She plays bass, she plays bass
Nothing matters 'cause we're both in space
Pretty shit we could never date
She plays bass, she plays bass

Guess we're both stuck in the same boat
The world doesn't seem to get us though
You're just stuck in space
Just playing your bass

She plays bass, she plays bass
Nothing matters 'cause we're both in space
Pretty shit we could never date
She plays bass, she plays bass

She plays bass, she plays bass
Nothing matters 'cause we're both in space
How I wish we could just date
So you could teach me how to be more like you

Wish I was more like you
Wish I was more like you
Wish I was more like you

"Space Cadet"

Feeling shit again
Haven't left my bed
Never brush my hair
And if you look me in the eyes you'll see that I don't care

You don't seem to understand
This candy floss made spacecraft
Took the dirt out from my brain
Threw them out to outer space

Through the Milky Way
Past the morning sun
Pluto is lightyears away
And all our fears, they're all gone

Let loose, we live only for a little while
In hindsight, we'll die anyways
Extraterrestrial beings probably sitting tight
Waiting to blow our brains away

Through the Milky Way
Past the morning sun
Pluto is lightyears away
And all our worries, they're all gone

So quit being so negative
It's fine don't be a temporary fix
You say I don't write happy songs
So I guess this is the first one

Through the Milky Way
Past the morning sun
Pluto is lightyears away
And all our worries, they're all gone

"Care"

It's been a while since I've talked about it
Maybe it's time to co-operate
I need some help to forget about it
I don't want your sympathy
Stop saying you give a shit
Because you don't really care
Care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah

It's been a while since I've thought about it
Maybe it's time to communicate
I was seven to think about it
The fact I still can't forget about it
I don't want your sympathy
I guess I've had it rough
But you don't really care
Care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah

Oh, by the way I'm still the same
I'm still the same
But are you the same
Oh, by the way I'm still the same
I'm still the same
But are you the same
Are you the same
Are you the same
Are you the same
Are you the same
Are you the same
Are you the same
Are you the same
Forget about it

I don't want your sympathy
I guess I've had it rough
But you don't really care
Care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah
Care, care, care, yeah

Are you the same
Are you the same
Are you the same
Oh-oh, oh-oh
You, you-ou

Are you the same
Are you the same
Are you the same
Are you

"Worth It"

Your eyes are just like his but your face is a bit different
You're a bit more fucked but I guess that's fine
Maybe, that's what I want this time

Say that you're breaking up
Connection too slow
So just try texting again
Don't pick up the phone
Don't think we can be friends
'Cause you're too pretty
I wanna see you again
I don't know what I'm saying

This is too bad to boast
But this is my way to float
And if I shut up I'm scared I'll drown
But maybe that's the best for now

Say that you're breaking up
Connection too slow
So just try texting again
Don't pick up the phone
Don't think we can be friends
'Cause you're too pretty
I wanna see you again
I don't know what I'm saying

Don't think this is worth it
Don't think this is worth it
I'm not wasting time
But you've been on my mind
Don't think this is worth it
This time

Say that you're breaking up
Connection too slow
So just try texting again
Don't pick up the phone
Don't think we can be friends
'Cause you're too pretty
I wanna see you again
I don't know what I'm saying

Say that you're breaking up
Connection too slow
So just try texting again
Don't pick up the phone
Don't think we can be friends
'Cause you're too pretty
I wanna see you again
I don't know what I'm saying

"Dye It Red"

Kiss my ass, you don't know jack
And if you say you understand you don't
You don't
You don't
You don't

Fuck me, only when I'm keen
Not according to your beer
Your beer
Your beer
Your beer

So let me be what I've wanted to be

So let me cut my hair and dye it red if I want to
I haven't found myself so comfortable
I'm not stopping now

Touch me as if you mean it
Because I'm getting tired of being all alone
Alone
Alone
Alone

And if it's not for you guess I'll find it on my own

So let me cut my hair and dye it red if I want to
I haven't found myself so comfortable
I'm not stopping

Think I'd be better off alone
Now that I had some time to think
I've had to put up with your shit
When you're not even that cute

And maybe it's time to change my ways
But that doesn't include you

Let me cut my hair and dye it red if I want to
I haven't found myself so comfortable
I'm not stopping

Think I'd be better off alone
Now that I had some time to think
I've had to put up with your shit
When you're not even that cute

That cute
That cute
That cute

"Back To Mars"

Ask me again, are we friends or are we something more
Doesn't it hurt to think about how we were just before
Doesn't matter if sometimes we cannot stick to being friends
Doesn't matter if we break up just to act all fine again

Take me to the South of France where we could just be old friends
We'd go to the beach and you could braid my hair
You could braid my hair

"Charlie Brown"

Back on old habits
That no one knows about
Too bad that Charlie Brown
Has inked you up to slow you down
Has inked you up to slow you down

Throw it away
Throw it away
Throw it away

I call you if I need you
Give my brain a sec
I just need to figure things out
Figure things out

Throw it away
Throw it away
Throw it away

If I could die here a million times
Then what's the point of trying

Throw it away
Throw it away
Throw it away
Throw it away

"Emo Song"

Back on old ways, I know your face
I haven't seen you in some days
It hurts my head, my conscience dead
The fact I miss the way it felt

You're coming back again
Don't want you back again

You call me up and lie again
Like all the men I use to trust
Nobody knows when I was young
I lost my self in cosmic dust

You're coming back again
Don't want you back again

Just the thought of you doesn't stop
You're not a person or a thing
Just the thought of you on my limbs
It's all your fault
It's all your fault
It's all your fault
It's all your fault

"Sorry"

Sad I had to see you
But I don't and I won't and I won't
To think I was just like you
All alone skin to bone, skin to bone

And it hurts me
That you could be the one that deserved this
Even more
That you stayed in the same dark place that I adore
But you stayed for more
I guess that's what happens to the best of us
The best of us

I hope to come and see you
When your state's doing great, doing great
A part of me feels for you
That I'm doing alright and guess I've been feeling fine

But it hurts me
That you could be the one that deserved this
Even more
That you stayed in the same dark place that I adore
But you stayed for more
I guess that's what happens to the best of us
The best of us

I never want to think twice
With what could have been your life

And I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

And it hurts me
That you could be the one that deserved this
Even more
That you stayed in the same dark place that I adore
But you stayed for more
I guess that's what happens to the best of us
The best of us

And I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
I'm sorry

"Further Away"

Say what you want
It's hard 'cause it sucks
I'll just pretend to give a fuck
Maybe then you'll try to stop

'Cause was it so hard
To keep your mouth shut
They say the moon's miles away but your brain's further away

Who's laughing now
The shit that you used to say is out your mouth
Guess you feel better now

'Cause was it so hard
To keep your mouth shut
They say the moon's miles away but your brain's further away

Further away
Further away
Further away

"Horen Sarrison"

You are the smell of pavement after the rain
You are the last empty seat on a train
And I'm convinced you're from outer space

And I want you to know that I'm in love
But I don't want you to feel comfortable

You are the song that I need for my mental state
You are the bus that stayed when I thought I was late
So I'm convinced you're from outer space

And I want you to know that I'm in love
But I don't want you to feel comfortable

Eyes so green, I don't know what that means
But you make me feel like all this is real
But I don't want you to feel comfortable

And I want you to know that I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love

And I want to keep you quiet
And I know you feel the same
And I'm sorry I'm gone so often
But I know you'd do the same
The same
The same

I want you to know that I'm in love
But I don't want you to feel comfortable

Eyes so green, I don't know what that means
But you make me feel like all this is real
But I don't want you to feel comfortable

And I want you to know that I'm in love

"How Was Your Day"

How was your day
Was it okay
'Cause we haven't talked in a while
Forgotten how you used to smile

What do you look like
Remember when we used to fight

And I miss getting angry at you
'Cause at least I felt something new

'Cause I miss all the fuck ups we've had
'Cause even then you're the best that I've had

Call me up late
Say it's okay
'Cause I'll be away a while
I can't remember your smile

You used to kiss me
Guess it's not hard to believe
That I miss getting angry at you
'Cause at least I felt something new

'Cause I miss all the fuck ups we've had
'Cause even then you're the best that I've had

'Cause even when we're miles away I know
You'll still want me as usual

But the thing that I know is that I wanna be with you

How was your day
Was it okay
'Cause we haven't talked in a while
Remember when we used to smile
You used to miss me
Guess it's not hard to believe
That things have to change like the weather and the days

But the thing that I know is that I wanna be with you

"Together"

Crash the car again
The same mistakes again
Don't wanna hurt you like I did

'Cause I'm not waiting for you
But I don't want to hurt you

All alone again
It hurts my heart again
I think my blood is running thin

I'm away again
It hurts my head again
Don't wanna be away from your skin

'Cause I'm not waiting for you
But I don't want to hurt you

Guess that's how my life will go
At least we're together though
Together though
Together though
Together though

Hurt myself again
I thought you'd notice it
Don't wanna fix it like you did

'Cause I don't want to let you know
I've been thinking of letting you go
Guess that's how the story ends
At least we're together again
Together again
Together again
Together again

Fine I'm okay by myself
I'm doing great
But we'd be better together
Better together
Together though
Together though
Together again

"Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene"

He-, hold up, fuck
He-, what the fuck
Sounds like a fart
(One, two, three, four)

He smells very nice
Oh so nice
Wears clothes that I like
He doesn't even try
He doesn't even try

And I think that I want to marry him
But I really don't want to freak him out
I know all our children's names
They're called Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

Loves me till I die
I'll be his corpse bride
And when I smell he says it's fine
Oh how nice

And I think that I want to marry him
But I really don't want to freak him out
I know all our children's names
They're called Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

I'm scared he's gonna leave me
'Cause when I'm mad I get pretty scary
But he won't and he won't because I'm pretty
And we'll have lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots
Of babies

Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene
Yoshimi, Forest, Magdalene

"First Date"

Meet me by the corner shop
The one that sells the flower pot
To tell me that you bought it with your cash
And not your mother's coupons

Build a rocket ship out of soft clay
And take me right up into space
And I can see how our day went
We'll see if we're just friends

'Cause I know you know
It's still pretty awkward
Grow some balls and just say
Where'd you wanna go, where'd you
Where'd you wanna go on our first date

"Last Day On Earth"

You made it
It's your last day on Earth
You killed someone last night
And burned down a church
Oh, you made it
For what it's worth
Well, and if it all goes wrong
And it looks like we'll soon be gone
Then we should all just get along
And sing a song I wrote
And it goes like this, it goes

Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo, oh yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo, oh yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You made it along
You got a problem with Peter, you got a problem with John
You can't go on
All this follow me shit
I want to get fucked up at home
Be naked alone
And turn up my phone
Because this song I wrote is just so fucking sick, it goes...
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Wait, I got something to say
(What's that Oh shit)
I forgot, wait a minute
The world's about to end so I'm gonna have to finish
I guess if it were nicer, we'd be better off innit
I haven't got a plan, so I'm think I'm gonna wing it
Naked, alone with this song I wrote and it goes like this
It goes

Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo, oh yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo, oh yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah), yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo, oh yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo, oh yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Shoop-doop, shoop-doo, badoobadoo
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

"Cologne"

Am I seductive
Call me back in an hour
If you wanna go back home
Oh babe, at least leave the scent of your cologne
Leave the scent of your cologne

I'm not done yet
Please kiss my neck
Let's go for another round
I hate what this song is about

Am I attractive
Tell me, am I good enough
Lately I've been on and off
I think I've heard too much, my wrists are numb
Heard too much, my limbs are numb

I'm not done yet
Please kiss my neck
Let's go for another round
I hate what this song is about

You're in my head
You're in my head
Fuck

I'm so attractive
Think I'm going to explode
Baby, I've been hung around
Won't you just drop your shit and pick up the phone
Drop your shit and pick up the phone

I'm not done yet
Please kiss my neck
Let's go for another round
I hate what this song is about

"Animal Noises"

I'm still afraid of the dark
But mornings are scarier
'Cause when I'm awake, I spend half of my day
Wondering what to do
I'll miss the 9 a.m train
'Cause I slept through my alarm again
Forgetting to eat is affecting my sleep
But I guess that's just part of the trend

I miss the mornings I spent making animal noises with you
I just need someone to hold but I guess that I'm getting too old
It's something I keep getting told
I guess that I'm getting too old for this

Well, I guess that I've made some mistakes
And you know that I've told a few lies
If I call in the morning, I know you'd be boring
And say my behavior's alright
Maybe you like my mistakes
And maybe I get what I like
Maybe the things that made you wanna live
Were the things that made me wanna die

I miss the mornings I spent making animal noises with you
I just need someone to hold but I guess that I'm getting too old
It's something I keep getting told
I guess that I'm getting too old for this

For this
I'm too old for this
For this
Ah, ah, ah

I miss the mornings I spent making animal noises with you
I just need someone to hold but I guess that I'm getting too old
It's something I keep getting told
I guess that I'm getting too old for this

"He Gets Me So High"

He pretends, he is my closest friend
It's a lie, when he cries
We'll uncloak his disguise
He's a kick on my side
And I wish that I'm your ride

He gets me so high
He gets me so high
He gets me so high
I can stay in bed
But he can't stay in my head
He gets me so high

He gets fed and lives under my bed
It's been said, that it's all just in my head
(Are you feeling alive)
I'll come back when I meet you
(Just pretend I'll be fine)
I need to know that I want you
(You need reflecting of mind)
When you know that I
I always end up coming back to you

He gets me so high
He gets me so high
He gets me so high
I can stay in bed
But he can't stay in my head
He gets me so high

I'm so high (So high)
I'm so high
I'm so high (So high)
I'm so high (So high)
I'm so high (So high)
So high

He gets me so high

"Beatopia Cultsong"

Is it me or recently time is moving slowly
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly
Is it me or recently time is moving slowly

"1036"

You don't need me
As much as I need you
As much as I need you
Take it or leave it
'Cause you know that's the truth
'Cause you know that's the truth

I know you thought it was just us
I didn't think you'd fall in love
You're just a warm body to hold
At night when I'm feeling all alone

I don't want to, yeah, yeah (I didn't mean that, that thing I said last night, it was)
I don't want to, yeah, yeah (I don't know what happened)
I don't want to, yeah, yeah (I have this thing where I, I can't really be by myself)
I don't want to, yeah, yeah (But look)

Called you for the last time
I need to be with you
I need to be with you
Saw you in a dream last night
You looked like a ghost
You looked like a ghost

I know you thought it was just us
I didn't think you'd fall in love
You're just a warm body to hold
At night when I'm feeling all alone
I know you thought it was just us
I didn't think you'd fall in love
You're just a warm body to hold
At night when I'm feeling all alone
I know you thought it was just us
I didn't think you'd fall in love
You're just a warm body to hold
At night when I'm feeling all alone
(You don't) I know you thought it was just us
(Need me) I didn't think you'd fall in love
(As much as I need you) You're just a warm body to hold
(As much as I need you) At night when I'm feeling all alone

I don't want to, yeah, yeah
I don't want to, yeah, yeah
I don't want to, yeah, yeah
I don't want to, yeah, yeah

"Sunny Day"

Know it's been raining, I swear, I'm not lonely
Always complaining that you never see me
Call in the morning when you wake
Maybe tomorrow, we're okay
When it's a sunny day

I'll keep you posted
I promise I'm better
With the sun we'll leave my house
I'm sorry for yesterday
You know I don't mean it
I promise I'm better
With the sun we'll leave my house
I'm sorry for yesterday

Keep me here
With your skin on mine again
While you're there
It's easy if I pretend

Don't know why I feel this way
Treating all my friends the same
Haven't had enough to do
But I'm not ignoring you
Call in the morning when you wake
Maybe tomorrow, we're okay
When it's a sunny day

I'll keep you posted
I promise I'm better
With the sun we'll leave my house
I'm sorry for yesterday
You know I don't mean it
I promise I'm better
With the sun we'll leave my house
I'm sorry for yesterday

Keep me here
With your skin on mine again
While you're there
It's easy if I pretend

"See You Soon"

I wanted to be everything you see
But I went the wrong direction
I needed some affection
And I'm not sure why but
I will see you soon
(I guess I have to take it, I'm deteriorating)
Feeling blue

It's a walk in the park
You said, "It's not that hard"
I'm feeling kinda dizzy
I don't want this to leave me
And I told you, I'll

See you soon
(I guess I have to take it, I'm deteriorating)
Feeling blue
(I try to have a meaning and it looks appealing)
I want you

I had some time away
Didn't want to go insane from this
I wanted you to know
I need time to grow and to exist
I think I needed space
Let you know I'm safe
I swear it's just a little thing

See you soon
(I guess I have to take it, I'm deteriorating)
Feeling blue
(I try to have a meaning and it looks appealing)
I want you

"Ripples"

Please don't make me hide
I've been putting up a fight
What's the use of it now
When I get pulled down
Anyways I've been hiding my expressions
You can't blame the reflections
And the ripples on the ground
I might as well have drowned

So I'm keeping busy
Work twice as hard as you
Want you to believe me
That I can pick and choose
You said you'd let me drive your car
As long as I'm with you
Then you'd wait till we'd get far
To tell me that you'll be gone soon

Feels too late right now
I've been holding back
'Cause I'm afraid that I'm too loud
Six feet underground
I feel alone again
Stuck between the friends
I guess I'll figure my way through them
Not sure how I'd do it
But I'm sure now the people will listen
As the water glistens and I see my reflection
So much clearer

So I'm keeping busy
Work twice as hard as you
Want you to believe me
That I can pick and choose
You said you'd let me drive your car
As long as I'm with you
Then you'd wait till we'd get far
And tell me that you'll be gone soon

"The Perfect Pair"

You ought to know that
I think we're one and the same
I don't think we could help it
No, I don't think we could help it

We don't talk much
I guess 'cause nothing has changed
I'm not sure I like it
And I'm so tired of fighting

If I told you, you know how to go and break my heart in two
'Cause I will anyways
We'd end up like always
You know me, you better show me that you can say it to my face
'Cause you know we're the same
There's worse things I can take

I know you hate it
When there's nothing to say
I'm not quite sure we'd fix it
I guess we're so used to it

Wish I had noticed from the beginning
I find it hard to work out
Why we have all this now

If I told you you know how to go and break my heart in two
'Cause I will anyways
We'd end up like always
You know me, you better show me that you can say it to my face
'Cause you know we're the same
There's worse things I can take

"Broken CD"

Don't think I'm over it
It hurt when I was seventeen
Flew by so quickly, I
Could hardly breathe

Don't think I'm over it
Like I always said I was
Like a broken CD
That plays on repeat

Don't think I'm over it
It hurt when I was seventeen
Flew by so quickly, I
Could hardly breathe

Don't think I'm over it
Like I always said I was
Like a broken CD
That plays on repeat

"Talk"

Call you up on a Tuesday
Say "What's up"
Babe it's too late
Why'd you have to be so complicated
Complicated

'Cause I'm not sure if I've seen you before
You looked familiar when I saw you
We go together like the gum on my shoes
We make out, we make out when it's too late
We go out, we go out on a Tuesday

A crowded place
Waiting for you
Am I lost why can't I find you
A silhouette that's in my head
You don't exist
You're my imagination
You don't exist
You're just a bad decision

'Cause I'm not sure if I've seen you before
You looked familiar when I saw you
We go together like the gum on my shoes
We make out, we make out when it's too late
We go out, we go out on a Tuesday

'Cause I'm not sure if I've seen you before
You looked familiar when I saw you
We go together like the gum on my shoes
We make out, we make out when it's too late
We go out, we go out on a Tuesday

"Lovesong"

I didn't think I'd ever want this yet
When we had first met in fall
Guess it's something you learn to accept
When I've been a mess it's not your fault
But I keep forgetting it's what we do

I missed the train again
I called your name
As if you'd drive it back
I swear you're in my head
Throughout the day
I can say that for a fact
Know we had better days
But to keep me sane
I guess that this is just another love song
About you
Just another love song
About you

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do

I'm running over sentences at times
I'd better quit dreaming just so I could write
Yet the words to describe you aren't so hard to find
Like a good quote from a book that I've memorised
But I keep forgetting just what to do

I missed the train again
I called your name
As if you'd drive it back
I swear you're in my head
Throughout the day
I can say that for a fact
Know we had better days
But to keep me sane
I guess that this is just another love song
About you
Just another love song
About you

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do

"Pictures Of Us"

Pictures of us
Buildings and rust

I don't know what it means to get better
Last night's emergency
Her and me

She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it all
No, I don't think I could do it
She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it all
No, I don't think I could do it

And I don't know what it means to get better
Last night's emergency
Her and me

She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it all
No, I don't think I could do it
She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it all
No, I don't think I could do it

She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it
No, I don't think I could do it
She reminded me that God starts with a capital
But I don't think I could do it
No, I don't think I could do it

"Fairy Song"

Need to drink water
Remember to pray
Eat so you're stronger
And live for the day
Speak to your brother
Check he's okay
Need to get out more
Don't smoke all day

I know you're sad 'cause someone died
But I'm not gonna sit inside and do nothing

Guess when I'm older
I'll be able to see
That when it gets colder
I care less about me
I should sleep like I promised
And brush my hair
Always be honest
And that would be fair

I know it's hard to comprehend
There's so much things we have to mend
I know you're sad 'cause someone died
But I'm not gonna sit inside and do nothing

Guess that's what you meant
We can still be friends
I'm not with you but
Make it till the end

Guess that's what you meant
We can still be friends
I'm not with you but
Make it till the end

Guess that's what you meant
We can still be friends
I'm not with you but

"Don't Get The Deal"

Tell me
How do you feel
I've realised
You just don't get the deal

Tell me
(I wonder if the time we spend) How do you feel
(I could have been a fireman) I've realised
(I'm thinking that I don't get the deal) You just don't get the deal

Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind
We've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now I guess we were meant to be

Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind
We've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now I guess we were meant to be

Am I caught in a daze
The look in your eyes
Is never the same

Am I caught in a daze (I think it's getting harder to see)
(I know that I've been losing sleep) The look in your eyes
(I don't think it's ever the same) Is never the same

Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind
We've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now I guess we were meant to be

Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind
We've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now I guess we were meant to be

I needed some time alone
To see that it hurts
You're looking for something
But I'm here to make it worse

Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind
We've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now I guess we were meant to be

Take time, I'll wait a little bit
I don't mind
We've done this all before
It feels like we'll stop eventually
For now I guess we were meant to be

"Tinkerbell Is Overrated"

I paint a picture on my wall the other night again
I have a feeling that I'm losing all my oldest friends
Spend a week inside I'm tired and I think they know
Way to go
Saw a spider living in my room the other day
I asked politely if I didn't mind I thought he'd stayed
A crow is on the roof, he peers inside, I think he knows
Then he goes

I can't pretend when I'm with my closest friends
'Cause Tinkerbell is super overrated

I started smoking in the mornings and stay in bed
I'm not a woman in my room I'm just a girl instead
I think the bug I saw that bit you he had always known
Way to go

By the way
I came to tell you
My hairs turned grey
And I think I grew
I'm afraid of lying in my room
I stay awake and it sees the truth

I can't pretend when I'm with my closest friends
'Cause Tinkerbell is super overrated

I was around on Sunday night
I wish I was at home where I feel nice
Now that I lay here in my bed
I wish that I went to meet you out instead

The sky looks all red
It's fine
The rose that I had planted yesterday died
It's fine
I lost the book that I read
It's mine
And when I leave my house I will regret it 'cause I

By the way
I came to tell you
My hairs turned grey
And I think I grew
I'm afraid of lying in my room
I stay awake and it sees the truth

I can't pretend when I'm with my closest friends
'Cause Tinkerbell is super overrated

"You're Here That's The Thing"

Catch the rain
Even on a sunny day
I swear I'm not excusing
I'll cross my heart to prove it
But she seems tired 'cause we've been through this

And I know you said that we're not a thing
But you're here that's the thing
And I'm not trying to give you a ring
Well maybe on the phone if you let it sing
You're overcomplicating everything
When the lights go down don't say I didn't warn ya
I don't think that's legal in the state of California

I've got you wrapped around my finger
Like a piece of ribbon
You just won't admit it that you're smitten
Hold on a minute please won't you listen
'Cause I'm not sure if you're into
Me like I'm into you
I said a lot of stupid things in the winter
Once the ice got thinner
But somehow we managed through the fall
So I guess it's not that bad at all

That we're not a thing
But you're here that's the thing
And I'm not trying to give you a ring
Well maybe on the phone if you let it sing
You're overcomplicating everything
When the lights go down don't say I didn't warn ya
I don't think that's legal in the state of California

I'm going away
Did I forget to mention how long I'd stay
Is that a question for another day
But while we're away

And I know you said that we're not a thing
But you're here that's the thing
And I'm not trying to give you a ring
Well maybe on the phone if you let it sing
You're overcomplicating everything
When the lights go down don't say I didn't warn ya
I don't think that's legal in the state of California

"A Night To Remember"

Swore I'd seen you before
Watched you walk through the door
Somethin' in your eye
Reminded me of somebody I used to know

You touch my back
I took your hand
Somethin' from your touch felt shockingly familiar
And I'd swore I'd seen you before

Oh, I swore I'd seen you before

Underneath the sheets
You enchanted me
And whispered sweet nothings in my ear
I shivered beneath you
All wrapped up in embers
It was a night to remember

Then I walked away
You asked me to stay
Now you're thinkin' of what could've been
But you've become someone I've seen before

I swore I'd seen you before

Underneath the sheets
You enchanted me
And whispered sweet nothings in my ear
I shivered beneath you
All wrapped up in embers
It was a night, enchanting night
To remember

"Coffee"

Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
And I promise that one day I'll feel fine
And I promise that one day I'll feel alright

And I'll make a cup of coffee
With the right amount of sugar
How you like it
And I'll make a cup of coffee
With the right amount of sugar
How you like it
How you like it

Don't know how long I'll stay for
It's okay, I'll knock on your door
Won't you come down and get me
I like it when you hold me
Tight

You make me feel nice
The green in your eyes
Makes me feel warm inside

And I'll make a cup of coffee
With the right amount of sugar
How you like it
And I'll make a cup of coffee
With the right amount of sugar
How you like it
How you like it

"Get Along"
(from "Ivy  Bean" soundtrack)

Tell me the things you let me know
No need to rush we'll take it slowly
Guess, our worlds colliding
The difference in us is hard to prove
Guess I just have to get to know you
But, I'll take my time trying

Memories through photographs that makes us laugh
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while

(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)

Spending all of our time figuring what to do
Not to far there's a place just for us two
Its an endless world that's outside so I'm sticking with you
Guess it's fine in our minds there's enough to do

Memories through photographs that makes us laugh
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while

In a place not far from home
Somewhere we both go
In our way we can't relay
In the end we're just the same

I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while
I think we do get along just right so why won't we stay for a while

(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)

"Glue Song"

I've never known someone like you
Tangled in love, stuck by you
From the glue
Don't forget to kiss me
Or else you'll have to miss me
I guess I'm stuck forever by the glue
Oh, and you

Finding the right words
To use for this song
I have you in mind
So it won't take so long
Never thought I'd find you
But you're here
And so I love you

I'm not wrong
When I say I've been stuck
By the glue onto you
I've been stuck by glue
Right onto you
I've been stuck by glue

I've never known
I've never known someone like you
I've never known
I've never known someone like you

"Glue Song (Remix)"
(feat. Clairo)

I've never known someone like you
Tangled in love, stuck by you
From the glue
Don't forget to kiss me
Or else you'll have to miss me
I guess I'm stuck forever by the glue
Oh, and you

You've been hiding in plain sight
And it appeared, oh I know
Loving you once only feels wrong
I need you
I always knew I'd find you
To be here is worth the wait to
I'm not lying
When I say I've been stuck
By the glue onto you

I've been stuck by glue
Right onto you
I've been stuck by glue

I've never known
I've never known someone like you
I've never known
I've never known someone like you

"iScream"

I'm not who I like
I'll fight you till I'm right
I'm right, you're wrong
In my mind I scream this song

Corbyn, my best friend
Taught me everything I know in my head, and he's
Braindead in the tool shed
Didn't hear a single word you said

I must apologize
Say it one more time mister magpie
Goodbye cool guy
Laugh again, you're gonna get a bruised eye
What's your problem
With me
Something's gone wrong
What the hell is happening

I bleed, I scream
Ice cream's under my jeans
What the world doesn't get is I'm me
In my rocky beep beep
I'm not who I like
I'll fight you till I'm right
I'm right, you're wrong
In my mind I scream this song

This could be forever
Is that too much to ask
We'll try and make it last
One day more
We could be together
Hang out in the day
But then you'll eat my brain
So whatever

In my jeans
This ice cream is for everyone
And I want you to be the one
In my dreams
I run around the world sometime
Then I'll take you back to mine

I bleed, I scream
Ice cream's under my jeans
What the world doesn't get is I'm me
In my rocky beep beep
I'm not who I like
I'll fight you till I'm right
I'm right, you're wrong
In my mind I scream this song

In my rocky beep beep

I'm vindicated
You're saturated
Will you stop taking it
Just a wannabe, beep beep
I dream this dream
I can't explain it
And I just shave my head
Goodbye honeybee, beep beep

I bleed, I scream
Ice cream's under my jeans
What the world doesn't get is I'm me
In my rocky beep beep
I'm not who I like
I'll fight you till I'm right
I'm right, you're wrong
In my mind I scream this song

What's your problem with me
I'm right, you're wrong
In my mind I scream this song

"Silver Into Rain"

Someday I'll be caught up in the wind
Maybe I'll spill it out my skin
And the earth will take me down
One day I'll no longer have my bed
And I'll forget the things you said
On a rainy week in June

Blowing away, I'm sipping on ros
Turning gold into grey and the silver into rain
Blow me away, I'm too young for my age
Too shy for the stage, too careful to be brave

Oh
Getting hard to see things straight
It's not too late
Oh
Getting hard to see things straight
It's not too late

Blowing away, I'm sipping on ros
Turning gold into grey and the silver into rain
Blowing away, I'm sipping on ros
Gold into grey and the silver into rain

I'm blowing away, I'm sipping on ros
Gold into grey and the silver into rain
Blowing away, I'm sipping on ros
Turning gold into grey and the silver

I'm too young for my age

"Susie May"

Susie May goes out at night
Thinking of all the things she likes
She can't afford to throw those things away
Susie May forgets she's not okay

And does she know
It's not fine that she cries at night
And does she know
It's not alright that she hates to fly
Susie May, you're not okay
Time to find your way

And I'm alright, don't you see
Always tangled in bedsheets
You can see it in my eyes, always
1 AM with swollen eyes

And does she know
It's not fine that she cries at night
And does she know
It's not alright that she hates to fly
Susie May, you're not okay
Time to find your way

And I'm alright, don't you see
Always tangled in bedsheets
You can see it in my eyes, always
1 AM with swollen eyes

"The Moon Song"
(feat. Pig)

I'm lyin' on the moon
My dear, I'll be there soon
It's a quiet, starry place
Time's were swallowed up
In space, we're here, a million miles away

There's things I wish I knew
There's no thing I'd keep from you
It's a dark and shiny place
But with you, my dear
I'm safe and we're a million miles away

We're lyin' on the moon
It's a perfect afternoon
Your shadow follows me all day
Making sure that I'm okay
And we're a million miles away

"the way things go"

And there's so much left to say
I guess I'm just the bigger guy
And there's too much on my mind
That I don't even want to try
Guess it's not far from the ordinary
They do say love is blind
But I guess that's the way things go

Can't remember how to say your name
Let alone count all the freckles on your face
A distant memory I used to know
Oh I guess that's just the way things go
Oh I guess that's just the way things go

Can't remember when you said you called
Miles away and it was still my fault
The love you said you had, it sometimes showed
Oh I guess that's just the way things go
Oh I guess that's just the way things go

There's so much left to say
I guess I'm just the bigger guy
And there's too much on my mind
That I don't even want to try
Guess it's not far from the ordinary
They do say love is blind
But I guess that's the way things go

Didn't think you'd ever stoop so low
Getting with the only girl you know
A lousy route that only makes me say
That's pretty lame and that's the way things go
Oh I guess that's just the way things go

Passed your house when I was on a train
In my mind you'll always stay the same
I'm happy now, I ought to let you know
But I guess that's just the way things go
Oh I guess that's just the way things go

And I don't mind that that's the way things go
And I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, I don't mind
Oh I guess that's just the way things go
Oh I guess that's the way things go

"bite"

It's unforgivable
[]
I am lately ()
I feel like I'm goin crazy
I felt invincible
When you saved me
I thought maybe
We could be more than a phase
We weren't together very long
Maybe that's what went wrong
I have fallen too fast
And you got caught in the act
Why did you have to go and lie to me
Could've just confronted me
Didn't have to let me go that fast

I know you know
That I know that I was just a rebound
Not anything real
I shouldn't be waiting (waiting)
Or pacing (or pacing)
Or thinking that you've changed
For real

And I know that you're still in love with her
Even after all of the things that she did
You just can't help it
You ditched me
And acted like you didn't even care
I don't know how we got here
But my fear that []
Mmmm
I live my life in []
Apparently you wanted back in my life ()
I'm turning all the tables now
You don't think I'm able to forget you
But honey I might
You think I'm innocent
Harmless
Just a little child
But baby
I fight

"her"

She was a diamond
In a sea of storms
Her brown eyes
Are finally shimmering on their own
She knew, she knew, she knew
That she would be okay

For a moment
Time stopped
For a moment
It was just her
And the things on that mountaintop
She knew, she knew, she knew
That everything was okay

Oooh
This girl
She was fragile
And so it seemed
She only showed the side of her
That people wanted to see
She wanted to see the world
But was trapped in a cocoon
So she hacked a rocket ship
Headed straight for the moon

"give way"

I know a boy
He looks like a sin
But he smells like whisky
His mouth tastes like gin
He's caring and compassionate
But doesn't ever show it
I wanna know what goes through his mind

I know that boy
He can sometimes be a handful
He loves a lot of things
And I would like to know about them, too
So let me in
And I'll show you
What makes me different from you
I'll show you everything
That makes you, you
Ooo
We'll reimagine
All the things we thought we knew
Just me and you

We'll fly (fly by)
Fly away (fly away)
From all the things that we carry
Things that we share
And wish that would give way
We'll fly (fly by)
Fly away (fly away)
Two lonely people
With nothing to lose (nothing to lose)
And everything to gain
Ohhh
Da da da da da da da da da
Won't you
Give me a smile
Da da da da da da da da da
Won't you
Stay with me for a while

"waiting"

I can't wait to take you around the world
With me
I can't wait for you to get back home
So we can pack up and leave
I don't know why this scares me so much
I've been through this before
Maybe I'm realizing that this is nothing like before
But something about this is different
Now I know for sure
It's crashing down on me
Like a wave hits the shore

I'm packing up my pieces
Letting it all fly with the wind
For you, for you
I'll feel
But so what
Who cares
If I'm just throwing my life away
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
And home will always be
Home will always be
Waiting for me
When I get back home
When I, When I, when I
Get back home
I can't wait for magical stardust in the sky
One of these days
I'll pack up and start a new life

Hey, you over there
Why don't you come over here
Tell me about your dreams
I'll tell you about my schemes
Are you afraid
Scared of wanderlust
Don't break the news
Let's just adjust

I'm packing up my pieces
Letting it all fly with the wind
For you, for you
I'll feel
But so what
Who cares
If I'm just throwing my life away
Il'll be with you
I'll be with you
And home will always be
Home will always be

Packing up my pieces
Letting it all fly with the wind
For you, for you
It's always for you
But so what
Who cares
If I've thrown my life away
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
And home will always be
Home will always be
Waiting

"gone"

How do I know
When it's time to let go
I keep living in a daydream
And I can't find my way home
Did I miss a sign
Was there something I needed to find
Lost and confused
I write my feelings on paper
In the form of a song
Like this will help me along
I don't know where we went wrong
Can't get out of bed
I am stuck in my own head
I need to write a new song

I don't know where you went
But it's somewhere I can't get to
Why do you insist on living like this
Why won't you let me find you
Help me
Let me remind you
What we had was innocent
But careful and strong
What we had was great
But now it's gone

Oo-oo-oo-oo
Yeah

You are replaceable
And boy I'm unbreakable
Can't shoot me down
I won't surrender now
In the form of a song
Like this will help me along
I don't know where we went wrong

Only trying to help tore apart whatever we felt
Now it's gone
I don't know where you went
But it's somewhere I can't get to
Why do you insist on living like this
Why won't you let me find you
Help me
Let me remind you
What we had was innocent
But careful and strong
What we had was great
But now it's gone
Oh, now it's gone

"Indigo"

Where the girls are the fairest the boys are the rarest
Ohhh

Love
Blue
Oceans move for you
Fire
Rain
Hits me all the same

Oh indigo
Indigo
You and I made indigo
Deep deep indigo
Indigo

Sand in my crotch, there's sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch, there's sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch, there's sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch, there's sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Yeah

"I Know A Boy"

I know a boy
He likes to laugh
His brain is mess
But I like it like that

I know a boy
He tastes like the moon
Hangs up the stars
That dance 'round my room

We paint by numbers
But color outside the lines
We don't do what we should
We beat to our own time

Baby
Love can be so damn magical
Hey we
Are already lovesick
And flower pickin'
Daisies and roses
We're doing fine
Baby
Our roses
Are intertwined

I know a boy
And he is mine
Mmm

"New"

I feel like running
So far away from here
I'm stuck in pudding
Can't move an inch my dear

Maybe in time
I could learn to love another
Maybe he'll be just like you

Maybe in time
I could grow to be some other
Person who can love like you
Ooh, ooh

I'm just existing
Not taking up too much space
It's probably this thing
Making my heart jump out of its place

I know in time
I will learn to love another
I hope he's just like you

I know in time
I will grow to be some other
Person who can love like you

I'm not happy
But I'm getting through the days
I feel lonely
But I don't let the darkness engulf me in flames

I am new
Because of you
I feel free
Because you helped me see

Sometimes I wonder
Sometimes I don't
Lightning and thunder
Threaten to sink my faltering boat

I hope you know
That I've never loved another
Quite the way that I loved you

I hope you know
That I'll never find another
Person who can love like you

I'm not happy
But I'm getting through the days
I feel lonely
But I don't let the darkness engulf me in flames

I am new
Because of you
I feel free
Because you helped me see

Oh, ooh

"Honeydew"

Wait for me when I go
Live in color but don't forget my aching soul
I can see the blue moon
Late at night, I wonder if you see it, too

I feel lost without you
Maybe you do, too
I feel like I'm no one
Maybe I'm like you
Faith and honeydew

I'm alone and you're not here (not here)
You can't run to me and comfort all my fears (all my fears)
Maybe that's a good thing though
Not dependent on someone else to help me grow

I feel lost without you
Maybe you do, too
I'm so much like you

I don't know how to get through this
I don't know what to do
Maybe if all these mountains drifted to you
Do you know if the sky is falling
Do you know when it hits
And all these mountains fall before their names hit your lips
Our love cannot grow when it's suffocated
Not right now, but we both know, time will mend the craters
I tell myself that I don't
Mind this space but behind this face I'm lost

I feel like I'm no one
Maybe I'm like you
Faith and honeydew

"Ocean Blue"

I'm speechless
No words I make have meaning
Right now they're
Lost within me deep within me you complete me please don't leave me now

You're beauty
Inside and out
Enchants me
You understand the way I work
I understand the way that you work too
We fit like glue

There's not a thing
I wouldn't do for you
You make me sing
You inspire the words of my youth
We are far apart but they still hold true

It's so easy
To lose myself in you
I could hide
Inside your eyes
Deep and misty ocean blue
I was fine until I spent a while
Let myself drift
I couldn't see that I was
Slowly losing independence
Oh now
I feel much more free
I can finally see how
Time is everything
Oh love alone is not enough to heal the pain

I find you
So interesting
Your brain works
In ways I've never seen before
It's so annoying yet so intriguing too
I need you

There's not a thing
I wouldn't do for you
You make me sing
You inspire the words of my youth
We are far apart but they still hold true

It's so easy
To lose myself in you
I could hide
Inside your eyes
Deep and misty ocean blue
I was fine until I spent a while
Let myself drift
I couldn't see that I was
Slowly losing independence
Oh now
I feel much more free
I can finally see how
Time is everything
Oh love alone is not enough to heal the pain

"Are U Okay"

Am I real
Do I feel
These things that I feel
Do you feel them too
I'm drowning in glue

Tears, they fall
Down my pink cheeks
They don't have homes
Landing wherever they fall
Are you okay
Not at all

Leave
Watch as I fall
Watch as it all rains down in time
Leave
Watch me my love
Watch as the dove begins to fly

I fall in love
Every time I hear your name
Listless and strong
About what I used to claim
Don't call me back
But then maybe I want you to care
You can't look back
But then how will you know if he's there

It's like walking through sand
Trying to fall
Out of love
On command
Never quite reaching the end
I'm trying to pretend

Leave
Watch as I crawl
Watch as the sky turns purple-blue
Leave
Watch me begin
It's not a sin to still love you

I fall in love
Every time I hear your name
Listless and strong
About what I used to claim
Don't call me back
But then maybe I want you to care
You can't look back
But then have will you know if he's

There are so many things that remind me of you
I need to get out, leave for my sanity soon
There are so many things that remind me
I need to get out, leave for my sanity
There are so many things that remind me
I need to get out, leave for my sanity
There are too many things that remind me of you
I need to get out, leave for my sanity soon

"Daisy"

Oooh (Bum bum)
Oooh (Bum bum)
Oooooh

Once there was a girl
Who captivated the world
She drew them in with her voice like money
That girl she had it all
Could make the fairest fall
She drew me in with her lips as gold as honey

If she knew
I longed to touch her silken skin each night
And if she knew
I did this all for her
If she knew
I need her by my side to breathe alright
And if she knew

Daisy, Daisy, please don't go
Daisy, Daisy, keep me
Oh, let me heal you
Let me break you
And we'll do it again
I just crave you
Let me save you
From the man who is your hand
I don't wanna be alone
So tell me where did I go wrong
Help me see the green light in front of me

Mmmm
Ba dum bum
Hmmmmm

"Roses And Riots"

I could count the stars
Wait until the dawn
I could cry tears of honey
Sweet as the hummingbird's song
I could drift away
Walking paths I'd never thought to follow
I could meet someone new
Feed them love and make them swallow

You are mayhem and quiet
You are roses and riots

I don't know where to start without you
Even though I'm beginning to doubt you
You say everything that I need to hear
Ghost-like words that drift around the atmosphere
You linger even when you're supposed to be dead
You always did say things that you wanted unsaid
Loving an artist is hard when it's only in bed
'Cause I was always more beautiful inside your head

"Give Me A Minute"

Give me a minute
Just one will do
I'll say goodbye, to gossamer skies
The city will move out of frame
But it's still you who remains

Give me a minute
Kiss me again
I'll say goodbye, to cloudy blue skies
I trade all I got in my name
For you instead of this pain

Maybe it's time to forget you
Maybe it's time to throw dirt upon your name
Or place blame
But it's no one's fault
No, it's no one's fault
We're just late

I'll give you a minute
Let you have peace
I'll say farewell, to what I can't tell
I bet that you'll do just the same
And maybe I'm what remains

"Nothing  Sad N Stuff"

[Nothing]

I don't wanna leave
So tell me why I'm going
I don't wanna leave
But I'm gone
I don't wanna leave
But I'm already running
And if you ask what's wrong
"Nothing"

Oh, I'm so sorry
I am a fool
I'm so sorry
For what I'm about to do

Here's your shirt I stole
Take back what you gave me to hold
I can wear my own coat when it's cold
I don't need yours, mmm
'Cause I don't think I can do this anymore

I'm not sorry
That I loved you 'til I couldn't breathe
It was lovely
But I know that it's not what I need
It was good, but it's time for me to leave

[Sad N Stuff]

Something doesn't feel right
Maybe it's the time
Something doesn't feel like it used to
And nothing really rhymes
Maybe it's the changing of the seasons
Or maybe it's a sign
Hmmm, hmmm

Something doesn't sit well
Maybe it's the food
Something doesn't fit
Well, I think I always knew
That it could be the way I don't speak Spanish
Or it could be you
Hmmm, hmmm

He feels good to come home to
But not to stay
I'm afraid
That he feels good to hold on to
But it feels good to say
That I'd be okay
Without you, I'd feel the same

I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone all at once
And I don't know, I don't know how to get back what was
Is it something in the wind or the rain that makes me sad and stuff
Or is it just... you

He feels good to come home to
But not to stay

"Over-The-Ocean Call (Andrew)"

[Over-the-Ocean Call]

[] the corner
No
Please, just-
No, hold on, I'm-hold on

Does this make sense to you
'Cause it doesn't make sense to me
Does this have weight for you
'Cause it doesn't have weight for me

And I think my mind is far away
Sort of strange, this is
But I think I'll call you anyway
Call collect, 'cause baby this is

An over-the-ocean call
And I thought I could make it short
But my brain's all out of sorts
I can't hide it
And I'm staring at my wall
And I thought that I wouldn't cry
But breaking your heart breaks mine
I can't hide it
An over-the-ocean call
Is how I told him
This isn't working anymore

I needed space from you
But this doesn't look like space to me, oh
And you hate the things I do
And sometimes you hate me

But I think my mind is far away
Sort of strange, this is
But I think I'll call you anyway
Call collect, 'cause baby this is

An over-the-ocean call
And I thought I could make it short
But my brain's all out of sorts
I can't hide it
I'm staring at my wall
And I thought that I wouldn't cry
But breaking your heart breaks mine
I can't hide it
An over-the-ocean call
Is how I told him
This isn't working anymore

I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine
I'll call from over the ocean
This time, this time, this time
I'll break your heart through the phone, I
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine
I'll call from over the ocean
This time, this time, this time
I'll break your heart through the phone, I
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine
I'll call from over the ocean
This time, this time, this time
I'll break your heart through the phone

With an over-the-ocean call
And I thought I could make it short
But my brain's all out of sorts
I'm staring at my wall
And I thought that I wouldn't cry
But breaking your heart breaks mine
An over-the-ocean call
Is how I told him
This isn't working anymore

[Andrew]

Let me count all the freckles
On your arms alone
Let me smooth out the wrinkles
In the nicest shirt you own
Oh to love you is sweet like a peach
I think your laugh is my cure
Oh to love you is summer in reach
Kiss me and tell me I'm yours

Andrew, I'm falling
Without a warning
Until the morning
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Just kiss me slow, oh
I love you, you know

"I Knew"

I knew that you loved me
When you walked me to class in the dark
I knew that you loved me
When you ran to the store for a card
You couldn't find a pencil, you asked someone sweetly
You wrote out a note and you ran back to meet me
And gave it to me on the bridge
I said I would never forget this
And I never did

I knew that you loved me
When you walked me back home one night
I knew that you loved me
When I saw that my shoe was untied
You bent down to tie it in the middle of the street
There was snow everywhere, it was turning to sleet
But I knew when you looked up at me
This was where I was meant to be

So why
Why did you have to go
Why did you have to go so soon
Why
Why did you leave me there
Why did you leave me without you
Why did I think I knew

I knew that you loved me
But you told me we just weren't right
And I knew that I loved you
When I couldn't fall asleep that night
I miss hearing all of your favorite songs
And I wish I could tell you, "turn it all off," one more time
And everyone laughs and then it is quiet

Why
Why did you have to go
Why did you have to go so soon
And why
Why did you leave me there
Why did you leave me without you
And why did I think I knew

"Where Do I Go"

I am good with directions
I can find my way just by looking at stars
I have not lost my senses
I can find my way through a room in the dark

But I don't know
How to figure out where to go
From here

I'm lost and confused
Where do I go without you
Where do I go without you

I'm the breeze on a fall day
And I don't stop to think, I don't catch my breath
I have memorized places and feelings
I know them all like the back of my hand

And I don't know
How to figure out where to go
From here

And now I'm alone on this island
I drink so I don't think of you, oh oh
And now I'm alone
I don't know if this was the right thing to do

Where do I go without you

I wanna tell you I miss you
But that contradicts what I told you before
I wanna tell you I love you
But do I really know how I feel anymore

And I don't know
How to figure out where to go
From here

I'm lost and confused
Where do I go without you
Oh, where do I go without you

"To The Mountains"

Oh, I'm headed to the mountains
I'll be back in a week or two
Don't you try to reach me 'cause I won't pick up for you
I've got some things I need to do

Hmmmm

Oh I'm headed to the mountains
Where the air is sweet and new
Don't you try to reach me 'cause I don't want to talk to you
I've got some thinking to do

I'm trying to let go
I think it could help being alone
And I'm trying not to let you make me cry
I've spilled too many tears
And I think I deserve to be alone

And don't you try to reach me while I pick myself up and go
I've got to do this on my own
I need to build myself a home

Ohhhhh

Oh, I'm headed to the mountains
The only place I feel at peace
And I knew you'd come after me so I threw away your keys
But I know you'd never go when I say leave
I'm headed to the mountains... don't wait up for me

"You, Love (Interlude)"

I'll go softly
So you don't hear a thing
I won't waste my time
Saying things that I don't mean

'Cause we're too young
And I don't want to fall just quite yet
It was you, love
But now I'm alone again

"Means Something"

I saw your name on a street sign
In the middle of nowhere
And that has to mean something

I know your zodiac sign
Me and Leos get along great
And that has to mean something

But for some reason
You're not here
And I refuse to believe
That means something

Oh oh

I felt the way that you hugged me
When I was broken inside
And that has to mean something

I felt the way that you kissed me
When we got too drunk that night
And that had to mean something (something, something)

But for some reason
You're not here
And I refuse to believe
That means something

Every time I think too much
It ends up crazy
I don't know how to not think about you
Every time I trust my gut
I think I'm crazy
'Cause I don't know how to put my trust in you

Do you think it means something
That I wrote another song about you

"Same Boat"

If I had the chance
To see the Northern Lights
I would book the next flight
And I'd buy a jacket

If I had the chance
To see snow fall for the first time
I would stop and rewind
To re-find the magic

But if there was ever a chance to tell you
That I think about you every single day
I don't know if I could take that chance
Or take your hand and say

You are on my mind (Oh, oh)
When I miss the snow (Oh, oh)
You show up when I hear that song or
I finally start watching that TV show
I don't know why every time that I think of home
I can picture you standing in the cold
But I, I'm scared 'cause I don't know
If you and I are in the same boat

If I had the chance
If you asked out of the blue
How I really truly feel about you
I don't have a clue how that would go

Oh, if I had the chance
Would I really tell you
Would I bare my soul and maybe end up crying in the bathroom
Or would I ask you to kiss me slow

'Cause you are on my mind
When I miss the snow
You show up when I hear that song or
I finally start watching that TV show, oh-woah
I don't why every time that I think of home
I can picture you standing in the cold
But I, I'm scared 'cause I don't know
If you and I are in the same boat

"Pancakes For Dinner"

Don't wanna be forward
Don't wanna cross a line
But if I were to crash in this plane tonight
I'd want you to know this

Don't wanna say too much
Intrude on your space
But if I were to crash and I never made it home
I'd want you to know this

Oh, and to tell you is too scary
So I'll just say something else
And I wish that you could hear me
When I talk to myself
But this plane might not land safely
So what the hell do I have to lose
If I just tell you

I wanna eat pancakes for dinner
I wanna get stuck in your head
I wanna watch a TV show together
And when we're under the weather we can watch it in bed
I wanna go out on the weekends
I wanna dress up just to get undressed
I think that I should probably tell you this in case there is an accident
And I never see you again
So please save all your questions for the end
And maybe I'll be brave enough by then

Don't wanna say something wrong
Don't wanna be weird
But if you're still in love with her, I think that I'll leave it there
And I won't ever tell you this

Oh, 'cause to tell you is too scary
So I'll just say something else
Like how was fall semester
And what was that song about
I'll try to hide the way I feel
But I'll just wanna shout
What do I have to lose right now

I wanna eat pancakes for dinner
I wanna get stuck in your head
I wanna watch a TV show together
And when we're under the weather we can watch it in bed
I wanna go out on the weekends
I wanna dress up just to get undressed
I think that I should probably tell you this in case there is an accident
And I never see you again
So please save all your questions for the end
And maybe I'll be brave enough by then

Or maybe I won't ever say what's in my head
No, I won't have to say anything
You'll say it instead

"How Do I Tell You"

I'm a little scared you'll leave
Even though you tell me you won't
I'm a little scared of being
Someone that you're scared to love
You don't talk the way he did
And you don't say the things he did
I'm not who I was back then but still

I'm a little scared to speak
'Cause I can't find the words to say
And I don't want to make this about me
I just can't hold it in today
But you don't play the games he did
And you don't make me feel like shit
And my mom likes you more than him
But still

How do I tell you that I've come to like the pain
How do I tell you that I don't know what it means
To be happy with somebody
Don't know anything 'bout that
Who the hell can write a love song without making it too sad
That's all I've been
How do I tell you
How do I tell you I got it from him
Ooh, ooh, ooh

I'm a little prone to feel a little overwhelmed with it all
'Cause you are someone I want to know
And I hope you don't let me fall
You make sure I get home safe
And you always know what to say
I feel like I found my place
But still

How do I tell you that I've come to like the pain
How do I tell you that I don't know what it means
To be happy with somebody
Don't know anything 'bout that
Who the hell can write a love song without making it too sad
That's all I've been
How do I tell you
How do I tell you I got it from him
How do I tell you I got it from him

"Apple Pie"

Some days I'm lonely
And some days I'm not
Some days I am only
A little bit sad, not a lot

How do you
How do you make a home
What to do
'Cause I never stay too long

Every house looks the same in my dreams
Every house feels like home for a couple weeks
I've been runnin' 'round trying to find a
Place where I can breathe
But me oh my
I found you under an April sky
And you feel like
City life, apple pie baked just right
Home is wherever you are tonight

Some days feel empty
Some days feel whole
Someday we can be in the same city
Someday we'll be grown and I'll be
Fine with packing up
Cardboard boxes filled and sad farewells
And I'll be fine with that goodbye
As long as I don't say goodbye to you as well

'Cause every house looks the same in my dreams
Every house feels like home for a couple weeks
I've been runnin' 'round trying to find a
Place where I can breathe
But me oh my
I found you under an April sky
And you feel like
City life, apple pie baked just right
Home is wherever you are tonight

Let's rent a place
Two rooms and a window facing
Buildings and fire escapes
Might be no AC
A little bit cramped
But see if I'm with you, it's okay
(Mmmmm)

Me oh my
I found you under an April sky
And you feel like
City life, apple pie baked just right
Home is wherever you are tonight

"Headstones And Land Mines"

Headstones and landmines
Flowers and red wines
They buy you nice things
And they sing pretty songs
But it doesn't help

Oak trees and dirt piles
Funerals and mistrials
They say pretty words
And they hug from six feet
But it doesn't help
And nothing works but time
And it all hurts but it's fine

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mhmm, hmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mhmm, hmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, hmm

Chaos and carpet
A study in scarlet
The room doesn't talk
And the furniture nods as I pass

Heights marked in pencil
Kitchen utensils
The books don't say sorry
They don't crowd and touch
They're just observers collecting their dust
They know that nothing they say is enough
So they don't say a thing

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mhmm, hmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mhmm, hmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, hmm

"In Agreement"

I talk to my walls about you
Pretty sure they're tired of hearing it
I talk to my walls about you
Now all four know your name
I talk to my walls about you
And I think they agree the room doesn't feel the same
And there's only you to blame
Oh, oh

I talk to my friends about you
Pretty sure they're tired of hearing it
I say I met a guy, and he treats me real nice
Which is good for a change
I talk to my friends about you
And I think they agree my exes weren't always great
And I don't really buy into fate

But you tell me I'm pretty
And you don't ask for too much
'Cause you know and I know
That promises sometimes can hurt
When it's barely begun
And I don't want this to fall through
Collapsing is what I'm used to
But we're all in agreement
This is something I should hold onto
Mmm, mmm, mmm

I talk to my mom about you
She thinks you sound wonderful
I talk to my mom about you
And I tell her you are
I talk to my mom about you
And I think we agree I found what I was looking for
And now I know for sure

'Cause you tell me I'm pretty
And you don't ask for too much
'Cause you know and I know
That promises sometimes can hurt
When it's barely begun
And I don't want this to fall through
Collapsing is what I'm used to
But we're all in agreement
This is something I should hold onto

"Let Light Be Light"

My brain feels heavy like too much TV
It's weighing on me like a pound of concrete
I know he wants me and that makes me happy
So why do I feel so weird
It's foggy in my head, like clouds in a storm
The wind's pickin' up, I'm boltin' my shit to the floor
But when I'm with him, my shit gets ignored
Is that why I feel so weird

I'm alone almost every night
And I don't know if I'm processing right
But my therapist says to just let light be light
So I'm letting him stay around
I think that he's good for me
This boy that I've found

I don't like getting attached
It makes me feel like I've done something bad
'Cause I'm not dependent, and I know that
So why am I scared I'm reliving that part of my past

'Cause I'm alone almost every night
And I don't know if I'm processing right
But my therapist says to just let light be light
So I'm letting him stay around
I think that he's good for me
This boy that I've found
Oh, I think that he's good for me
This boy that I've found

Is this what it's supposed to feel like
Is this what it's supposed to feel like
Is this what it's supposed to feel like
Is this what it's supposed to feel like

'Cause I'm alone almost every night
And I don't know if I'm processing right
But my therapist says to just let light be light
So I'm letting him stay around
I think that he's good for me
This boy that I've found

This boy that I've found, mmm

"...What Are We"

Given the circumstances
I won't ask you to stay
Given the circumstances
I would get it if you walked away

But all my life, I've been looking for this
It seems fitting that things go to hell now that I've found it

I don't think we're wasting time, but if you do, I'm sorry
I can see a life with you, but if you can't, I'm sorry
If four months mean nothing
If none of it counts for something, then I'm sorry
Oh, if spending every night in your bed
Has no meaning, then what are we
Just a sorry excuse for love
Love

Lately, the world is ending
So I won't ask for too much
Lately, the world is ending
And I find that I pretend to be okay with too much

But all my life, I've been looking for this
Real funny that things go to hell now that I found it

I don't think we're wasting time, but if you do, I'm sorry
I can see a life with you, but if you can't, I'm sorry
If four months mean nothing
If none of it counts for something, then I'm sorry
Oh, if spending every night in your bed
Has no meaning, then what are we
Just a sorry excuse for love
Love
A sorry excuse for love

"I Don't Know You At All"

I don't know your phone number
I don't think I ever did
I don't know if you love coffee
Or if you could live without it

Feels like we've been through war together
Feels like you've been right here forever
But I don't even know you at all

I don't know your favorite place to eat
Or what argument makes you square up to fight
I don't know your favorite way to sleep
Or if it changes every night

Feels like we've been through war together
Feels like you've been right here forever
But I don't even know you at all
At all
At all

I know more about your friends than I know about you
I know that they've placed their bets on us, but since we're through
They can keep the money that they've wagered on our love
And maybe, someday soon, some of them will lose
But I don't know you, and I'm guessing that you don't know me
I don't know you, so how could we expect our love to come with ease
I could say that we were kids, but that just isn't true
I could say we wanted to believe in something new
I could give a million reasons why but they won't do
'Cause in my heart, feels like I have always known you

I don't know your phone number
I don't think I ever will
I don't care if you love coffee
Or if just one sip makes you feel sort of ill

Feels like we've been through war together
Feels like you've been right here forever
And that's the thing that matters most of all

"Angelina"

Where did you go, Angelina
Why did you take my foolish heart Oh
I should've known, Angelina
I was never right for that part
I could've sworn, Angelina
We would get hitched and you'd be a bitch about
Getting us there on time
I'd thank the lord for Angelina
Oh, so I guess the wedding I'll never be getting
Will live in the back of my mind

I never loved you more than when you said goodbye
'Cause maybe I knew that love wasn't honest if you had to lie
I never loved you more than when you walked away
'Cause maybe I knew, Angelina, you'd never stay

Are you coming home, Angelina
I think I'm done trying to hold on to you, mmm
I think you should know, Angelina
That I'd probably fall again if you wanted me to
And she said "I love you", so I said it back
But I wished she was you, mmm

"When The World Stopped Moving"

It's so hard to watch you be happy
It's so hard to know that I'm not
'Cause when the world stopped moving
Like it did last week
I just wanted you to hold me

It's so hard to not be in your life
'Cause you know I love your brother
And your mom like they were mine
And when the world stopped moving
Like it did last week
I just wanted you to hold me

And all your friends are mine
They know that we're nothing alike, mmm
So if they believe that we're meant to be
I'd like to think they're right
But when the world stopped moving
You weren't by my side
And that didn't feel right

It's so hard to remember last winter
But like the porcupine and cactus
They don't care 'cause they've both got prickers
And when the world stopped moving
I felt just like them 'cause see

Love is more than words
And I also hurt you
We've both done the worst, but
When the world stopped last week
I just wanted you to hold me

"Stupid"

Why am I pulled to you
And why does it never feel like
I'm finished talking
When we're finished talking
Why am I pulled to you
And why does it never feel right
To not pick up when you're calling

You know me so well
Even if you don't know my favorite type of cereal
You know me so well
Even though we're both different people now

It's stupid, it's so stupid to miss you like this
I feel stupid, so stupid to miss you like this
'Cause I told you to go and you went
Oh, what did I expect
So it's stupid, it's stupid, I know that it's stupid
To love you
But I can't help it

Mmm, I can't help it
I can't help it

How did we get here
It makes no sense, but it feels like
A sign from God
That I keep ignoring
How did we get to this place we're in
It makes no sense, but it feels right
And maybe that's God
I probably shouldn't ignore him

You know me so well
Even if you don't know my favorite type of cereal
You know me so well
Even if you don't know I don't believe in God anyhow

But it's stupid, it's so stupid to miss you like this
I feel stupid, so stupid to miss you like this
'Cause I told you to go and you went
Oh, what did I expect
So it's stupid, it's stupid, I know that it's stupid
To love you
But I can't help it

"In What World"

Pack up your things
Here's a bus ticket home
For your troubles
I know it's not ideal
I'll walk you down
And my mom's on the porch
She wants to say goodbye
I know it's not ideal

But in what world do these things go the way we want them to
And I know I didn't cry
But I don't think I loved you
And in what world do we exist and not separate but us two
'Cause I know I didn't cry
And that said something to you
If that world exists, I'd believe
That love might have some chance of being true

We have moved on
And it's clear we weren't meant to be lovers
It's obvious sometimes, oh
I know some things now
But it's clear that I don't have a clue
It's obvious sometimes

But in what world do these things go the way we want them to
At nights, sometimes, I cry
But these tears are not for you
'Cause in what world do we exist and not separate but us two
An alternate dimension
Where I love you too
If that world exists, I'd believe
That love might have some chance of being true

"doomsday"

Pull the plug in September
I don't want to die in June
I'd like to start planning my funeral
I've got work to do

Pull the plug, make it painless
I don't want a violent end
Don't say that you'll always love me
'Cause you know I'd bleed myself dry for you over and over again

Doomsday is close at hand
I'll book the marching band
To play as you speak
I'll feel like throwing up
You'll sit and stare like
A goddamn machine

I'd like to plan out my part in this
But you're such a narcissist
You'll probably do it next week
I don't get a choice in the matter
Why would I It's only the death of me
Only the death of me

Pull the plug but be careful
I don't wanna die too soon
I think there's good in you somewhere
I'll hang on 'til the chaos is through

Doomsday is close at hand
I'll book the marching band
To play as you speak
I'll feel like throwing up
You'll sit and stare like
A goddamn machine

I'd like to plan out my part in this
But you're such a narcissist
You'll probably do it next week
I don't get a choice in the matter
Why would I It's only

The death of me was so quiet
No friends and family allowed
Only my murderer, you
And the priest who told you to go to hell
And the funny thing is I would've married you
If you'd have stuck around
I feel more free than I have in years
Six feet in the ground

Doomsday is close at hand
I booked the marching band
To play as you speak
I feel like throwing up
You sit and stare like
A goddamn machine

I'd have liked to plan out my part in this
But you're such a narcissist
That you did it on Halloween
I had no choice in the matter
Why would I It's only the death of me

"an ego thing"

Guns drawn, slow down
It's a battle over something stupid
They're all the rage right now
You don't know the truth
It's a battle that I think I'm winning
Something makes me think you think that too

I was trying to be honest
You don't make that easy to do

It's not that important
It's none of your concern
But you got angry
And said some angry words
It's not that I hate you
I hate that it hurt
There's nothing else to it
I can't do anything more, mm

Sharp knife, loaded gun
There are two ways we can do this
I know which would be more fun
I won't go first, won't apologize
Pretty sure that it's an ego thing
But I can't stand a compromise

I was trying to be honest
But now I think I should've just lied

It's not that important
It's none of your concern
But you got angry
And said some angry words
It's not that I hate you
I hate that it hurt
There's nothing else to it
I can't do anything more, mm

Ooh-oh, I was trying to be honest
If this is what I get, I won't be honest anymore
Oh, if this is what I get
I swear I won't be honest anymore

"erase me"
(feat. Jacob Collier)

Why am I awake
Nails on the floor
And soot on my tongue
I don't know his name
But I still taste the rum

Nothing there but skin
Skeletons crawl on the ceiling
They know
That him and his aftershave hit like a drug
(Drug)
(Drug)

Don't answer me
I'm calling just to hear you scream
And you're fading
But he feels like you in between
I've said too much
In and out of wanting us
Now you're fading
And I wonder who will erase me
Who will erase me

Race you to the end
My innocence waits like it desperately knows
That I'll crash if I don't let you go

Don't answer me
I'm calling just to hear you scream
And you're fading
But he feels like you in between
I've said too much
In and out of wanting us
Now you're fading
And I wonder who will erase me

Erase me
Erase me
And I wonder who will erase me

Don't answer me
I'm calling just to hear you scream
And you're fading
But he feels like you in between
I've said too much
In and out of wanting us
Now you're fading
And I wonder who will erase

Don't answer me
I'm calling just to hear you scream
And you're fading
But he feels like you in between
I've said too much
In and out of wanting us
Now you're fading
And I wonder who will erase me
Oh who will erase me

"called you again"

I called you again
I don't know why I keep on
Thinking that we're friends
'Cause we don't really talk anymore
And I'm sorry for that
Honestly I never really loved you that bad

And I could be the end of it
But I never know when to stop talking
So I make my bed and sleep in it alone
'Cause I never know when we're done talking
If I don't love you, then why

Did I call you again
I think that I was lonely
And I missed having friends
Now we don't really talk anymore
And it's good for us both
'Cause I know you love me the most

And I should be the end of it
But I never know when to stop talking
So I make my bed and sleep in it alone
'Cause I never know when we're done talking
And I should be the end of it
But I never know when to stop talking (When to stop talking)
So I make my bed and sleep in it alone
'Cause I never know when we're done talking
You're better off on your own

But you called me again
I don't know why it never seems to end
Now we don't really talk anymore
And it makes sense
'Cause all I do is hurt you
All I do is hurt you
All I do is cause you pain

'Cause I called you again

"all my ghosts"

(What the fuck)

You got a Slurpee for free
I caught you lookin' at me in the 7-Eleven
Under fluorescent lights

We walked in comfy silence
Footsteps down familiar sidewalk
Knowing that we were here in our dreams last night

All my ghosts are with me
I know you feel them too
Ridin' shotgun next to your free Slurpee
They know all of my habits, but they don't know about you
I hope that's true
Mmm
Mmm, hmm

We made sangria and failed
I spilled mac and cheese on my pants
And thought about kissing you underneath kitchen lights

Oh, all my ghosts are with me
I know you feel them too
Oh, did you stand there while we were takin' shots of Brandy
They know all of my habits, but they don't know about you
I hope that's true

I can see it now
The wedding of the year
I can see it now
He stands up there and wipes his tears
I can see it now
And all my ghosts disappear
I can see it crystal clear

You got a Slurpee for free
I caught you lookin' at me in the 7-Eleven
Under fluorescent lights

And all my ghosts were with me
I know you felt them too
Watchin' as I started to get dizzy
'Cause I hate all of my habits
But I happen to love you
I hope that's true

(Fuck you)
Hahahaha
(Fuck you)
Hahahaha

"reckless driving"
(feat. Ben Kessler)

I didn't mean to kiss you
I mean I did, but I didn't think it'd go this far
I didn't mean to kiss you
Now you can't focus on the road when I'm in your car

Now we're going one hundred, your hands aren't on the wheel
'Cause you're just staring at me like you're not convinced that I am real
And now we're at one-eighty and I can finally see
But then it's over in a second, crashed the car into the tree
Yeah, I can see it all happen, you'd rather die than take your eyes off me

I don't love you like that, I'm a careful driver
And I tell you all the time to keep your eyes on the road
But you love me like that, you're a reckless driver
And one day it will kill us if I don't let go

I don't know how to tell you
That I feel safe when you sit shotgun
Never felt this way with no one
And I lie when I tell ya
I know exactly where we're going
I get lost just for this moment

And now we're at one hundred, my hands aren't on the wheel
And I don't wanna lose this moment, want you to know just how I feel
And now we're at one eighty and I can finally see
But then it's over in a second, crashed the car into the tree
I don't know how it happened, guess I'd die to keep your eyes on me

'Cause I love you like that, I'm a reckless driver
You tell me all the time to keep my eyes on the road
Do you love me like that If I keep on driving
Would you hold me when we crash or would you let me go

Don't wanna scrape you off the pavement
I can't be your savior
I don't wanna be here when you lose control
Don't wanna watch it as it happens
See the crowd's reaction
I don't wanna be here when you kill us both

'Cause I don't love you like that ('cause I love you like that)
I'm a careful driver (I'm a reckless driver)
And I tell you all the time (you tell me all the time)
To keep your eyes on the road (to keep my eyes)
But you love me like that (do you love me like that)
You're a reckless driver (if I keep on driving)
And one day it'll kill us (would you hold me when we crash)
If I don't let go

'Cause I don't love you like that ('cause I love you like that)
I'm a careful driver (I'm a reckless driver)
And I tell you all the time (you tell me all the time)
To keep your eyes on the road (to keep my eyes)
But you love me like that (do you love me like that)
You're a reckless driver (I'm a reckless driver)
And one day it'll kill us if I

"weird"
(feat. Laura Elliott)

I've been having strange dreams
Seeing ghosts and breaking things
Room's on fire as I sit and watch it melt around me
I've been hosting screenings
Of slightly altered movie scenes
Seems familiar 'til I realize that they look just like me

Where am I I can't find the door
How long have you been here for
Where the houses all can talk
And I don't mind the creaky floors

And now we're in a basement
I feel wasted and I'm sure
That you'll kiss me anyway
That'll be just the thing to wake me

Maybe I'm weird or maybe I'm off the wall
But maybe it's weirder not to have dreamed at all

I can walk through walls now
Quietly I roam the halls
Suddenly I'm ten feet tall and I can touch the ceiling
I think I scared you off now
I'm regretting getting close hoping
It was just a ghost that sorta looked just like you

Where am I I can't find the door
How long have I been here for
Where the houses all can talk
And I don't mind the creaky floors

And now I'm in a maze
Down in this basement and I'm sure
That you'll miss me anyway
That'll be just the thing to wake me

Maybe I'm weird or maybe I'm off the wall
But maybe it's weirder not to have dreamed at all
Maybe I'm weird or maybe I'm off the wall
But maybe it's weirder not to have dreamed at all

"ceilings"

Ceilings, plaster
Can't you just make it move faster
Lovely to be sitting here with you
You're kinda cute but it's raining harder
My shoes are now full of water
Lovely to be rained on with you
It's kinda cute but it's so short

Then you're driving me home
And I don't wanna leave
But I have to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before
Before

Bed sheets, no clothes
Touch me like nobody else does
Lovely to just lay here with you
You're kinda cute and I would say all of this
But I don't wanna ruin the moment
Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos

But it's over
Then you're driving me home
And it kinda comes out as I get up to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before

But it's not real
And you don't exist
And I can't recall the last time I was kissed
It hits me in the car
And it feels like the end of a movie I've seen before
Before

"what a shame"

I don't wanna take my mind off you
Please, take me home and kiss me slow
And do anything you want to
Run your hand through my hair
It's okay to be rough
I'm a little bit tougher
Than all of your other girlfriends

But you're not allowed
She's got you under lock and chain
Too late to let her down
So you're not allowed
What a shame it would be if you left her now
Now

I don't wanna take my mind off you
Please, make me laugh and kiss me back
And do everything you want to
Push me up against the wall
It's okay to be rough
I can handle this stuff
Only if you're comfortable

But you're not allowed
She's got you under lock and chain
Too late to let her down
So you're not allowed
What a shame it would be if you left her now

Now
Now
Now
Now

"firearm"

I get high out the window
And I don't tell my mom
I mix you with my vodka
And it turns me on

There's a hole in my heart and I can't find the bullet
But you sleep with the firearm
I should've pulled it on you
What a shame, I can see it all
Now that we're through

I get drunk with my friends
Your name never comes up
I tell strangers online
That we broke up

There's a hole in my heart and I hate that it's there
'Cause I liked to act like I really don't care
But I do
What a shame that I put up with you

What a joke, was it all just an act
I hate that it took me so long to react
You had me convinced that you loved me
What a fucked up reality show
Was it fame or the lack thereof
I just don't know
You had me convinced that you loved me, oh

I'm not sure you realize
The pain that you caused
I don't feel like talking
But everyone else does

There's a hole in my heart and I can't find the bullet
But you sleep with the firearm
I should've pulled it on you
Now I don't have the energy to

"hate to be lame"
(feat. FINNEAS)

It's always on the tip of my tongue
I read an article on the internet
Told me that that's how you know you're falling in love
Don't really trust what's on the internet
But maybe just this once

Hate to admit but it might be true
Hate to admit but I think you knew
Hate to be lame but I might love you

It's always on the tip of my tongue
But I stop myself from saying it
Tell myself it's not the right time or something dumb
But then you kiss me like you do
And we're right back where we startd from

Hate to admit but it might be true
Hate to admit but I think you knew
Hate to be lame but I might love you

Do I love him Do I need him
Do I want him Do I care enough to say
That I love him, that I need him
'Cause I don't but I wanna feel okay
If I love him, if I need him
Maybe that will make him stay
If I lie, will I still feel this way

It's always in the back of my mind
Maybe my mistakes are the reason
That I made it back to you in time
If I could rewind
Would there be some butterfly effect
What if we never met
What if the stars never aligned

Hate to admit but it might be true
Hate to admit but I think you knew
Hate to be lame but I might love you

"nobody likes a secret"

I hold my anger in my stomach
And I'm starting to have side effects
From hating you this much
No explanation, just a quote in a magazine
Where you said you only dated me for fun
And I'm paraphrasing now
But the gist of it was how you never loved me
Only in it for the sex
And I really don't get how
You can say that and be proud of it
We both know you were in deeper than that

Nobody likes a secret
And I was always yours
It's almost been a year
And even so
I still don't know what for

"chemtrails"

I see chemtrails in the sky, but I don't see the plane
What the hell is my problem with taking the blame
'Cause I play with my food and then someone else takes it away
It's so hard to believe, but I'm trying to change

I see lines in the sand, but I don't see who made them
I still listen to that band that you showed me last April
I still play with my food, I'm a child at the grown-up's table
It's so hard to believe, but right now, I feel stable

I moved away and I grew a few inches
What a shame, I had a chance and I missed it
And there are some days when I hear that song
And I hate to admit it
But I miss it, I do
Oh, I miss it, I miss you

Oh, I miss it, I miss it, I miss you
Oh, oh
Oh, I miss it, I miss it, I miss you

I see chemtrails in the sky, but I don't see the plane
I know that I feel it, but I don't know the name
I play with my food and then I throw it away
So hard to believe I have to grow up this way

I moved out and I made some new friends
Sometimes when I shout, it feels like no one hears it
And there are some days when I think that, somewhere, you're watching
As I grow up without you
I miss it, I miss you
(Here is Elizabeth eating a big snack after being in the shower for fifteen minutes)
I miss it, I miss you (She's famished, you can tell)
(Say goodnight)
(Goodnight)

"orange show speedway"

Every guy at this festival has you in their eyes
I never think about it too much, but I'm thinking tonight
And it's really annoying that I'm triggered like this
'Cause your name isn't spoken, but I'm speaking it
And I don't know why it happened, but it happened like this

My best friends are with me and I feel okay
The last time I was here, I was eighteen
My mind is racing and I feel so strange
Last time I was here, you were with me

I fell in love at the Orange Show Speedway
It didn't look like this three years ago
I had it all at the Orange Show Speedway
Or someplace like that, it all looks the same
Everything changes, what a shame

I'm in the middle of the crowd and it's like no time's passed
I'm half-expecting you to be there when I turn to my left
We were stupid and young and I was so in love
We were just friends riding on the line between acceptable
And angering your girlfriend

My best friends are with me and I feel okay
The last time I was here, I was eighteen
My mind is racing and I feel so strange
Last time I was here, you were with me

I fell in love at the Orange Show Speedway
It didn't look like this three years ago
I had it all at the Orange Show Speedway
Or someplace like that, it all looks the same
Everything changes, what a shame

Uh, yep, ooh, fireworks
This is the best voice memo diary to date I think (This is amazing)
Just wanted to update myself
No one else listens to these but myself
(Hey), okay (You got the fireworks if you put that in a song)

I fell in love at the Orange Show Speedway
But I've never been here in my life
I think it all kinda feels like an Orange Show Speedway
When you're racing head-first towards something that'll kill you in five seconds flat
When I'm racing head-first towards everything that I want back

"30 Days"

It's been 30 days since I last saw you
30 days since we had nothing to fear
It's been too long now
I'm scared that I'm forgetting how you feel
30 days is way too real

It's been 4 weeks since I last saw you
4 weeks since we made plans to go north
It's been too long now
I'm scared that I'm forgetting you
I feel all out of sorts
4 weeks and I'm not yours

I've been reading books
I've started puzzles
I've been listening to all the greats
I've been trying new foods
I've been buying new shoes
But I can't seem to forget that it's been 30 days

It's been a month since I last saw you
No matter how you say it, it still means the same
It's been too long now
I think that I've forgotten how long it takes
For me to fall, I'm afraid
This time it wasn't long at all
And why it wasn't, I can't say
In fact it just took
30 days

"7pm"

It is 7 pm and I'm sitting all alone
No one's on my phone tonight
My boyfriend's in class
And my friends are back at home
And the internet is slow
So I can't watch my show tonight
Tonight

I'm losing my mind
I'm reading the news for the hell of it
I'm wondering if she's on your mind
Losing track of time
I'm learning to cook for the hell of it
And I'm wondering if she's by your side
Tonight (tonight)

I don't usually do this
But baby tell me that you love me and prove it
I'm just so far away it's easy to lose it
So tell me you're mine, oh
I'm so stuck and I need you to pull me back out (out, out)
Say you love me and maybe I'll stop having doubts (doubts, doubts)

It's 11 pm and I'm hanging up my phone
'Cause I've reached your dial tone again
Something tells me I'll go crazy
If you keep playing these games with me
So maybe I'll call you again, oh
And it don't make sense (it don't make no sense)

I'm losing my mind
I've smoked too much tryna deal with it
And I'm wondering if he's on your mind
Losing track of time
I'm takin' drugs on the couch just to deal with it
And I'm wondering if he's by your side tonight (tonight)

I don't usually do this
But baby tell me that you love me and prove it
I'm just so far away it's easy to lose it
So tell me you're mine, oh
I'm so stuck and I need you to pull me back out
Say you love me and maybe I'll stop having doubts

"And If"

Hey, I barely know you
But is it cool if I say hello
Hey, I want to know you
Is that okay Are you comfortable

And if I fall
I blame the whiskey, I blame my mind
And if your lips happen to kiss me
I will be fine, fine, fine
Pour me another glass of wine

Hey, you barely know me
But is it cool if I talk for hours
Hey, you could show me
What it is that's in that head of yours

And if I fall
I blame the moonlight, I blame your smile
And if I fall, I know that soon I'll be alright
Pour me another glass of wine

And if I cry
You won't mind

Who knows where
Who knows where love goes when it dies
How can a new love, tangled in you love, arise
Who can say
Who can say how we fell for each other
Every day I notice your gray eyes and I am pulled into another dream, another wish
A place in my mind where you and I can exist
I dream about it all the time
I see you and I wish you were mine

"b"

I don't know who you are anymore
I can't keep fighting this unwinnable war
I'm tired and hopeless, but I'd do it
A million times more

I don't know if I'm right anymore
You are the one thing I constantly look for
In the crowd, I'm broken, but I'll find you
So don't close the door

I have loved you
Since the first day we met
I will always love you
I'm gonna tell you, but not quite yet

Cause I know you're broken
And I'm sorry for that

"Bang"

What is this feeling I can't control
Am I dying and I don't know
Is this the end or
Am I just cold
My heart is frozen, he chilled me to the bone

Now I, I am the one who kills
Don't think I can I will
A lion and its prey
I'm waiting for the time to pounce, okay
Cover it up with paint
Smile and play the saint
I'm coming for your throat
Point and aim and

Watch it go down in flames
I'm just a bit insane
If this is what love is, I want all of it
Subscribe me to the pain
Who says that playing nice
Is always the best advice
Sometimes the only cure for the lonely pays the price

Oh no
I've lost my feet again
In this dirty, dirty world, I slip again
Who am I
Do I cry for them
Are we all just walking sinners
Do we all just get condemned

Now I, I am the one who kills
Don't think I can, I will
Take my hand
And we'll sit in the sand

And watch it go down in flames
I'm just a bit insane
If this is what love is
I want none of it, take away the pain
Who says that playing nice
Is always the worst advice
Sometimes the only cure for the lonely pays the price

Oh no

"bliss"

When I cry, you cry
Is this real life
I wanna know
Take me down to the coast
It's a new feeling
Not thinking, just feeling
I wanna know
Is this feeling revealing my soul

Sunburn on my nose
Sun in the sky
Your hand on my thigh
You pick up a rose
From the path down to the beach
You hold it out and say "You're beautiful"
Why'd you do that to me

This is bliss
When you kiss me
I am so oblivious to what's out there
Don't you worry if I start to stare
Oh, 'cause nothing's wrong
This is how it should have felt all along
Now I feel truly happy
I deserve to be happy

When it rains, I smile
Do you wanna stay a while with me
Am I falling Maybe, but it's TBD
Honestly, I love being alive right now
I hate saying goodbye but I love how it feels to let go
I know that it'll help me to grow

Oh, oh, this is bliss
When you kiss me
I am so oblivious to what's out there
Don't you worry if I start to stare
Oh, cause nothing's wrong
This is how it should have felt all along
Now I feel truly happy
I deserve to be happy

"Bored"

I walk away from you all of the time
We sleep in different beds every night
You say you love me, in reality, we fight 'til I lose my mind
I try to keep up with all I do wrong
You hate all of my favourite songs
I don't think I could tell you anything
It's gone on for way too long

I think it's pretty obvious, but you're pretty oblivious
So I'll be the one to break the bad news

I'm bored
Of saying the same things I've already said
So bored
Of talking to walls over and over again
Hope it doesn't seem like I'll put up with this forever
Just 'cause you like me
I don't hate the way I'm yours, I'm just bored

You walk away from me
All of the time
I dream about different guys
I say "I love you"
In reality I'm tellin' a lie

I think it's pretty obvious, but you're pretty oblivious
So I'll be the one to break the bad news

I'm bored
Of saying the same things I've already said (already said)
So bored
Of talking to walls over and over again (over again)
Hope it doesn't seem like I'll put up with this forever
Just 'cause you like me
I don't hate the way I'm yours, I'm just bored

I'm so bored
I'm so bored
I'm so bored

I think it's pretty obvious, but you're pretty oblivious
So I'll be the one to break the bad news

I'm bored
Of saying the same things I've already said
So bored
Of talking to walls over and over again
Hope it doesn't seem like I'll put up with this forever
Just 'cause you like me

I don't hate the way I'm yours
I don't hate the way I'm yours
I don't hate the way I'm yours
I'm just bored

"Ceilings (Demo)"

Ceilings, plaster
Can't you just make it move faster
Lovely to be sitting here with you
You're kinda cute but it's raining harder
My shoes are now full of water
Lovely to be rained on with you
It's kinda cute but it's so short

Then you're driving me home
And I don't wanna leave
But I have to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before
Before

If I ever decide to show you this
Like when we end up getting married in like 10 years
And we're about to have kids or something, I don't know
That's far-fetched but
If you ever listen to this, you're great and thank you for being you
The end

Bed sheets, no clothes
Touch me like nobody else does
Lovely to just lay here with you
You're kinda cute and I would say all of this
But I don't wanna ruin the moment
Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos
(I don't even know what I'm saying anymore, it's 1 30 in the morning)

But it's over
Then you're driving me home
And it kinda comes out as I get up to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before

But it's not real (Not real)
And you don't exist
And I can't recall the last time I was kissed
It hits me (hits me) in the car
And it feels like the end of a movie I've seen before
Before

"Clementine (Demo)"

I'm watching everything go sideways
And I can't do a thing to make it stop
I won't remember this tomorrow
But I'll be sad when I wake up

I wish we were back in your apartment
I want you to sing me to sleep
I'll forget my wallet so I'll have to come back
And you won't forget me

Thought it was only fair
But I swear I didn't think it through this far
You chose this first
So I didn't think it'd hit me quite this hard
I don't want to see this part

I'm watching everything go sideways
Feels like someone's messing with my head
I'm not prepared to never know you again
I'm sorry, can we stop this instead

Thought it was only fair
But I swear I didn't think it through this far
You chose this first
So I didn't think it'd hit me quite this hard
I don't want to see this part

When this is over
I'll never know that
I ever missed you at all
I'll be a stranger and
You will be kissing somebody
That I don't know
I'll take the train to the beach
And I'll sit on the sand
And I'll never know
I had a life before this
I don't want this

Thought it was only fair
But I swear I didn't think it through this far
You chose this first
So I didn't think it'd hit me quite this hard
I don't want to see this part

"Devil's Hold"

Hear the beat knock
As the heart stops
See the beast in the clean top
Making jaws drop
To the bottom of the barrels where we drink
Turn the water into wine
To get my finest couple hours for the night
The devil's music is a light
Intoxicated by the room
Boom banging, out the roof
Red the colour of the moon
Jerusalem could never bloom
In such a presence that consumes
Feeble minds, is only destined to submit
And so we lose
World of fools
Still I'm
Looking for quick thrills, in my head there's something missing
I'm in need of repentance, Mama thinks I'm not a christian
Really, I wrestle religion
Holy spirit guide my soul and keep me distanced
Need to get out of his hold, I see him grinning
Someone save me

I like the pain
And I like you
But the devil's got a hold on me too
I'd like to think
That I love you
But the devil doesn't play with fools

All puppets to the darkness, woah
Making a deal for the heartless souls
All good, all well
You should fold
Make it hard for me to break these walls
All puppets to the darkness, woah
Making a deal for the heartless souls
All good, all well
You should fold
Make it hard for me to break these walls

Eyes meet
Go toe to toe, sell your soul
For a fix of meaningless needs
A breeze
In the crevices of the dome piece
Alone these
Are the streets of temptation
We all face it
Forget the grace, back to the race
All we want is that first place medal
We do what it takes
Push others out the way
Then write them off as mistakes
The stakes are high
And pride can make the kings fall
Ring, calling out to get this big brawl started
On my knees, I got my hands cuffed
Need to put them both together, this world is full of bad luck
Exert the pressure, there's no blood upon my hands bruh
The serpent slithers
Makes its way into the grand bluff

I like the pain
And I like you
But the devil's got a hold on me too
I'd like to think
That I love you
But the devil doesn't play with fools

All puppets to the darkness, woah
Making a deal for the heartless souls
All good, all well
You should fold
Make it hard for me to break these walls
All puppets to the darkness, woah
Making a deal for the heartless souls
All good, all well
You should fold
Make it hard for me to break these walls

"False Art"

I've been sleeping late, and if I'm speaking honestly
My dreams are the only place the thought of you can't bother me
And when I'm wide awake, it takes all of my energy
To tell our friends we've never been this happy

Waiting for the glass house to come down
Waiting to hear that crashing sound
Waiting for the right words to tell you how

I don't wanna be false art
Pretend we're picture perfect
When we're breaking beneath the surface, mmm
I don't wanna be false art
Make love like we deserve it
To cover up what's hurting, hey
I don't wanna be false art

I've been making shit up, but I'll come clean
I finish in the bathroom while you fall asleep without me
And our friends, they say they want this, but they don't see
That it's inevitable, and inevitably

The glass house will come down
Just waiting to hear that crashing sound
Waiting for the right words to tell you how

I don't wanna be false art
Pretend we're picture perfect
When we're breaking beneath the surface (Oh)
I don't wanna be false art
Make love like we deserve it
To cover up what's hurting, hey (Hey)
I don't wanna be false art

I call it love when it isn't
I just like my picture better with you in it

I don't wanna be false art
Pretend we're picture perfect
When we're breaking beneath the surface, mmm
Oh, I don't wanna be false art
Make love like we deserve it
To cover up what's hurting, oh
I don't wanna be false art
I don't wanna be false art

"haven't stopped yet (demo)"

I've been falling in love with you from the moment we met
It's been consistent, a constant persistence and it hasn't stopped yet
It's cold but the window is open, and we sit on the ledge
Breathing in smoke
Breathing in all of this moment
So I don't forget

I've been falling in love with you since September 13th
I didn't know why you were on my mind so frequently
And when you kissed me for the first time I didn't want you to leave
Holding you close
Holding in those three words
That could change everything

On my couch, watching tv
Then you paused it, turned to see me
And you told me that you loved me
Nothing was ever the same
There has never been a moment
When I wish you hadn't paused it
On my couch, as we watched the office
Nothing was ever the same

I've been falling in love with you since the moment we met
And I haven't stopped yet

"Hold On"
(from "Dear Edward" soundtrack)

Everything feels so heavy
I am an acrobat for everyone
Curtains are drawn, I'm not ready
To face the sun

Dress it in prettier colors
When I'm alone, it will all come undone
You carve the space for my sadness
To be seen for once

Hold on to me
I'll hold on to you
The world is moving on without me
Please show me how to

Hold on
Please show me how to

You take my hands, and you tell me
We can stay here just as long as you need
Curtains are drawn 'til you're ready
Safe in this silence, we don't have to leave

Just hold on to me
I'll hold on to you
The world is moving on without me
Please show me how to

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on (Hold on to me)
Hold on (Hold on to me)
Hold on to me
Hold on (Hold on)
Hold on to me
Hold on

"Honeybee (Kelsey)"

You were a light
Like the moon
Shining bright
Wild and free
A bouquet of daises
A lark in a tree

Oh, the mountains, they whisper
Flowers, they bend
When your name is spoken among them
They know who you were
And you'll always be hidden away
Among the sycamore trees
No one could ever replace you
My honeybee, mmm

You were the wind
Wild and undisciplined
You lived without fear
Loved with a passion
That helped people heal

Oh, the mountains, they sing
And the flowers, they grow
When a memory surfaces of a time long ago
We'll never forget you
That much I see as the light dances off
Of the cabin and trees
No one could ever replace you
My honeybee

No one could ever replace you
No one could ever erase you
From their memories
Oh my honeybee
Flying free

Mmm, no one could
No one could ever replace you
My honeybee

"I Think I"

I wrote you a letter
But I cut my tongue sealing it shut
I guess that's what I get for
Not thinking before I speak up

I get underneath your skin
You break easy like porcelain
Funny how opposites attract
I know that you're hurt again
Biting through your cardigan
Never been good at knowing when to hold back

I think I love you
I hurt the ones I love the most
I promise it's not you
Push away when you're too close
I hurt the ones I love the most

I left while you were sleeping
Snuck out through the back and never said goodbye
I thought you knew me better
But every time I do this you're surprised

And I get underneath your skin
You break easy like porcelain
Funny how opposites attract
I know that you're hurt again
This is how it always ends
But we both know it won't stay like that

I think I love you
I hurt the ones I love the most
I promise it's not you
Push away when you're too close
I hurt the ones I love the most

I think I love you
I hurt the ones I love the most
I promise it's not you
Push away when you're too close
I hurt the ones I love the most

"If I Knew Your Name"

Somebody out there
Tastes like a cool spring day
Somebody out there
Will tell me it's okay
They will be as warm as summer rain
Lift me up and take me from the pain
Somebody out there will love me that way

I wish that you were mine, oh
I wish that you would drive slow
I'd kiss you if I knew your name
I miss a love I don't know
Three wishes for my very own Romeo
I'd kiss you only if I knew your name

If I see blue skies above, I think of you
When I see people in love, I think of you
The thought of you is so divine
You'll bring me flowers when I tell you you can be mine
That's how it'll start

Somebody out there
Likes to sleep in until 2
Somebody out there
Knows me better than I do
They will be as sweet as buttercream
Vivid like a Sunday daydream
Somebody out there
Will love me for me

This love will be something to remember
This love will be something for forever
I'll love you even if we're not together
Baby, kiss me just for good measure

When I see blue skies above, I think of you
When I see people in love, I think of you
The thought of you is so divine
You'd bring me flowers when I tell you you can be mine
And that's how it'll start

If I see blue skies above, I think of you
When I see people in love, I think of you
The thought of you is so divine
You'd bring me flowers when I tell you you can be mine
And that's how it'll start

"Just Because"

I know things that you don't know
I know why the flowers grow
Not because they're watered right
Not because they see the light
Just because I love you

I know things that you don't know
Why it rains and why it snows
Not because the heavens cry
Not because of a cloudy sky
Just because I love you

You can try to figure it out
But things like this are just unannounced
It might not make sense
'Cause I haven't told you yet
That I love you
That I love you

Oooh
Ooooh

I know things that you don't know
All my thoughts, I'll never show
Not because I'm unprepared
Not because I'm somewhat scared
Just because I love you
Just because I love you

"Lady In Blue (Pickup Live Session)"

Lady in blue
What are you looking for
What do you search for in these walls
Lady in blue
Do you find comfort in
All of these souls within these walls

Maybe you wander searching for love
And maybe you wander 'cause that's not enough
Oh lady in blue
I wanna know you

Do you ever get lonely up there, talking to yourself
I can only imagine
Do you ever get tired of being always by yourself
I can only imagine
Imagine that

And maybe you wander searching for love
And maybe you wander 'cause that's not enough
Oh lady in blue
I wanna know you

Lady in blue crying softly
Doesn't notice me as I walk by
Lady in blue turns a corner
And then she is gone with no goodbye

Maybe she's gone until dinnertime
Maybe she's gone for good
Maybe she won't come back until next year

Maybe the lady in the blue chiffon
Finally got what she always wanted
And maybe she'll never come back here

Oh lady in blue just disappeared

"Okay Again"

I couldn't stand in a room with you
And not think about that night
I had to cross the street if we were walking on the same side
It just hurt too much
Too many reminders that I messed things up
But now, we're okay again

I had to block you on Instagram
So I wouldn't feel impatient
I had to stop myself at least once a day
From thinking how her haircut makes us look the same and
It hurt a bunch
Too many reminders that I messed things up
But now, we're okay again

I've been taking my time not trying to get high with all the wrong people
We've been growing apart but I guess that's what happens to some people
And I know we're not friends but I'll always be here if you need people
I'm just glad that we're okay again

We had a party at our place
And you showed up with your best friends
It wasn't weird it wasn't awkward
It was just like seeing an old friend

After four whole months
I don't remember ever seeing you so happy
I guess we knew it wasn't meant to be us
It's been four whole months
I don't remember ever being this happy
I guess we knew it wasn't meant to be us

I've been taking my time trying not to get high with all the wrong people
We've been growing apart but I guess that's what happens to some people
And I know we're not friends but I'll always be here if you need people
I'm just glad that we're okay again

"Oops"
(feat. Ella Atkinson)

(Haha)
(Yeah, yeah yeah)

Pour me up a glass of whiskey
Refill it all the way to the top
I know that you wanna kiss me
If I let you, you could fuck me up

Day and night you get her love
Obviously you're tied up
Baby, you can use my cuffs (Cuffs, cuffs)
She's a bad bitch I agree
Jealousy looks good on me
I'll let you take it off of me
Oh, oh but

I know that you came with her
But if you'd like to leave with someone new
I could be dessert
You just say the word and I'll come through
I know you know the things I've heard
Do you wanna show me if they're true
This shit probably hurts
Knowing that I'll never cry for you
Oh, you fell in love with me Oops
Hmmm

You just stare as she walks towards us
High heels and whiskey in her cup
I know that you wanna touch her
If I let you that would fuck me up

Night and day you get my love
Obviously it ain't enough
You know that I play it rough, whoa
I'm a bad bitch I agree
Jealousy looks good on me
I'll let you rip it off of me

It looks like you came with her
But if you'd like to leave with someone new
I could be dessert
You just say the word and I'll come through
I know you know the things I've heard
Do you wanna show me if they're true
This shit would probably hurt
If I did the same damn thing to you
Oh, you fell in love with me
Oops

You got attached, now you need it
Send me a text, I'll delete it
That picture I sent, you can keep it
'Cause I don't really care that much
You fuck with her and I see it
Mess with my mind for no reason
You play with knives now you're bleedin'
But I don't really care that much, whoa

'Cause I know that you came with her
But if you'd like to leave with someone new
Go ahead and flirt (Go ahead and flirt)
Don't have to say a word, I'm watchin' you
You know I know the things you've heard
And now you realize that they're all true
Baby, it'll hurt (It'll hurt babe)
Soon you'll know the crazy shit I do

Oh, you fell in love with me (Oh, you fell in love with me)
Oh, you fell in love with me (Oh, you fell in love)
Oh, you fell in love with me
Oops

"Panic Room"

I gave up and fell asleep at 5pm
I was just thinking of you
I have been so far removed from my needs
I didn't know that I needed you

Told my sister, sent a picture of us to her phone
She said "it's so weird to see you with somebody"
Emma, what the fuck does that mean, I'm a bit offended
But I guess she's never seen me with somebody
That I like enough to show off to my family

I think that you are made for me
I think it's probably destiny
What are the odds we found each other

I gave up trying to hold myself back from this
What's the point in doing that
I have never felt the things I feel when you hold me
I'm so grateful for that

I think that you are made for me
I think it's probably destiny
What are the odds we found each other

I know that I was made for you
Hold me and that's my panic room
What are the odds we found each other
What are the odds we found each other

"Paranoia Purple"

Tell me
Will you leave me lonely
On and on and on, I know you told me
The most important reason why
You'll color in as many lines as I need you

Tell me
When we have no money
And the sirens start their callin'
You say slow down
Slow down, come on
Slow down

And this paranoia purple turns to green
And nothing is as simple as it seems
What's happening to me

Say now
When my life is over
Will you find somebody good enough to hold you
Someone like my Abigail
To tell you all is good and well like me now

Say now
I feel my colors show how
I think it's almost time for me to go now
Go now, go now
And this paranoia purple turns to grey
And all that's good and well
It melts away
Until we meet again

Ooh oooh
Mmmh-mhm

How could I forget about you now
How could I forget about you now
Forget about you now

"PERFECT"

Happy lies
Sheltered lives
Who knows where
We go when we die
If we're good do we get a prize

Can I say
By the way
I like the way you smile when I cry
Do you need to know why

We fall and then we fall again
We talk, but do we really make amends
Tell me what's wrong, I'll write a song
You light the bong and we'll forget, again

We wanna change but do we know how
We're comfortable and so we stay out of it
Let it run its course
Say no more and I'll pretend it doesn't exist

We're perfect
Perfectly fucked, certainly screwed
But isn't that how you sing the in denial blues
We can argue then sit
Staring up at walls too thick to punch through
But that's what happens with the in denial blues

Happy lies
Bloodshot eyes
I'm okay but are you alright
If I guess do I get a prize

Say my name
No more blame
I like the way you yell when I cry
I don't know why

We fall and then we fall again
We talk, but do we really make amends
Tell me what's wrong, I'll write a song
You light the bong and we'll forget, again

We wanna change but do we know how
I love you but it seems we've grown out of it
I care about you, always got you
Never doubt my love cause it's that real shit

We're perfect
Perfectly fucked, certainly screwed
But isn't that how you sing the in denial blues
We can argue then sit
Staring up at walls too thick to punch through
But that's what happens with the in denial blues

"physics or fate (voice memo)"

Why do I keep
Coming back to this
It's like a book I can't quite figure out
So I read it in pieces

Sometimes it hurts
Gotta set it down for a bit
But I always come back to this
Ooh

Why do I keep
Running into this
Every time I make a wrong turn
I end up on your doorstep

Sometimes it hurts
Gotta step away for a bit
But I always come back to this
I always come back to this

And maybe I'm stupid
For thinking the world might end
And maybe I'm stupid
For thinking you'd be with me when it did
And maybe you'd be better off
If you never saw me again
Again

But God damn I keep
Comin' back to this
I try to understand
But I can't make it make sense

Maybe it's time to just
Kinda go with it
'Cause even if its not now
I will end up here somehow
It's physics or it's fate
And I can't stop it

I always come back to this
I always come back to this

"Ruined"

Those candles that you bought me for Christmas
I can't burn them 'cause they smell like you
And every time I walk into a Starbucks, I see you at every table
It's been a while since I've had cold brew

Don't you know how hard it is to find a decent guy
In this city of four-thousand Where everybody looks like you
Don't even get me started on the way you saw this song online
And called, told me you didn't, but you did and I have proof that

You ruined The 1975, now I listen and think about getting high
In your bedroom, windows open
Mom is home but we're still smoking
You ruined The 1975, now I listen and cry 'cause you sang
"We share friends in Soho"
While you told me that none of your friends know

And I hated you for that but it's been two years now
And I really just hate you
For making me hate my favorite band

You broke my heart then went away to college
You were only fifteen minutes down the road
And I always thought you'd show up to say sorry
But as time went on, I started to lose hope

Don't you know how hard it is to find a decent guy
When you never gave me closure What the hell was I to do
Don't even get me started on the way you saw this song online
I guess it must've thrown you 'cause you called and said you knew that

I stayed quiet, but I probably should've told you
Every night I would cry and wish I didn't know you
I said nothing and now I got issues
I'll bill you for the tear-stained tissues
Oh, I don't think you have that kind of dough 'cause

You ruined The 1975, now I listen and think about getting high
In your bedroom, windows open
Mom is home but we're still smoking
You ruined The 1975, now I listen and cry 'cause you sang
"We share friends in Soho"
While you told me that none of your friends know

And I hated you for that but it's been two years now
And I really just hate you
For making me hate my favorite band

"Shifting"

My life is shifting
I can feel it in the way I smile
I need to go, I need to get out
I haven't felt this in a while

My life is shifting (ooh ooh)
And it's all because of you (ooh ooh ooh)
I need to get up and get over
But it's hard getting over you

Oh, (ooh ooh ooh)
I want you to be happy
You deserve the world (the world)
If I could pluck it out of the universe
You'd be the first one I'd call (first one I'd call)

(Ooh ooh ooh)
I hope someone loves you
In all the ways I never could (I never could)
One day, maybe five years from now
I'll bump into you

So please never forget me
I know it is time (it is time)
Honeydew burns easier
Love you, and that's a goodbye

"so are you (demo)"

It's ok to cry
Every day if you have to
It's ok to sleep
Peace from the war

It's alright to sing
Let it bring joy to the sorrow
It's alright to cry
Some more

I don't know your pain but I will fight
I won't let this go even if doing what's right
Isn't easy
I'm tired, believe me, but
So are you

I don't know your pain but I will stand
I won't let this go so take my hand
It's not easy
I'm tired, believe me, but
So are you
So are you

It's ok to cry
Or to laugh if you need to
It's ok to sleep
Peace from the war

"buggin"

I get hung up
Biting my tongue
And sucking my thumb
And waiting for those who don't want me

But you're bugging if you think I'm in love with you
I know that I told you
But I just need anything to give love to
You're bugging if you think I'm in love with you
I know that I told you
But I just need anything to give love to

There's a Beetle in the pool and I'm reaching out for you
And you're clinging to my fingerprints
Flashing purple blue
Cause there's a Beetle in the pool and I'm reaching out for
And you're clinging to my fingerprints
Flashing purple blue

I get hung up
Biting my tongue
And sucking my thumb
And waiting for those who don't want me
And you pile up
And I hope to go numb
But I scavenge the crumbs
And follow the trails that you leave me

I was bugging when I said I'm in love with you
I know that I told you
But I just need anything to give love to
I was bugging when I said I'm in love with you
I know that I told you
But I'd give love to anything that hurts like you

"talk abt"

I wake up on a Friday and I know that he's gone

I just need somewhere warm I can curl up
Just to rest my head
I just need someone that I can screw up
Like his cigarettes
He called me prophetic but I'm a fuck up
Call me that instead
I'm posting this bullshit so he'll know I'm up
But he's with his friends

He's all I talk about
He's all I talk about
Wish I could get him out of my mouth
But he's all I talk about

I sleep in on the weekend cause he's not in my dawn

I just need someone that I can shut out
Just to get ahead
I just need something that I can hear out
Just so it's misread
He called me electric but I'm a black out
Call me that instead
I'd cling like a leech if he'd put his arm out
Till I'm in his head

He's all I talk about
He's all I talk about
Wish I could get him out of my mouth
But he's all I talk about
He's all I talk about
He's all I talk about
Talk abt
He's all I talk about
He's all I talk about
Wish I could get him out of my mouth

"swallowing stones"

Swallowing stones
On the way to your home
I waste time being wistful and slow
Get so tired of singing your songs

Say I'll move to the city
When I'm finally grown
But I been driving the long way home
Round the block just to finish that song

Deciduous forest ain't growing my way
Say things'll get better when I get away
But I been watching the skyline and been getting home late
Counting ways that I love you and lights on the parkway

Where was I hiding when
We all grew up
Watching blinking lights changing
On the edge of some bluff
I keep making mistakes
And they're not makin' me any tougher
And I wish everyone liked me but
You'd be more than enough

Swallowing stones
On the way past your home
I like who your parents are voting for
There's a sign on your lawn

I'm gonna move to the city
When they tell me that I've grown
We could waste our lives being wistful and slow
Miss my prime while I'm choking on stones

"12"

Why do I feel like I'm half of a whole
With this head on my shoulders 10 fingers and toes
It's me that I live for but you I can't help but extol
Call me 12 but I think that I'm all that I have
Call me 12 but I think that I'm all that I have

Your people flow through just to give and to take
The crossing guards, lovers, and summer camp friends
And the teachers from the 7th grade
So all of these bad days are gonna grow worn with age
Till the hairpins and nickels that gleam on your floor
Are the only things that remain

Why do I feel like I'm half of a whole
With this head on my shoulders 10 fingers and toes
It's me that I live for but you I can't help but extol
Call me 12 but I think that I'm all that I have
Call me 12 but I think that I'm all that I have
Call me 12 but I think that I'm all that I have
Call me 12 but I think that I'm all that I have

"gold star"

When I watch a movie
I skip to where they kiss
And I said I'm improving
So you'd love me just like this

I'll wait up for you
I'll wake up for you
Talk to strangers in the elevator so
You think I'm friendly like you
Make my bed for you
For when you finally come through
Do I write these sad songs just to sing them to you
Could you give me a gold star and see me through

I found myself eating
Candy after the parade
It was smashed in the pavement
On the sidewalk in the shade

I'll wait up for you
I'll wake up for you
Talk to strangers in the elevator so
You think I'm charming like you
Make my bed for you
For when you finally come through
Do I write these sad songs just to sing them to you
Could you give me a gold star and see me through

"silver second"

Mitten in the snow
Angels in a row
My turn to place them
On the piano
Sweating through our coats
Blushing on the nose
We didn't know it
There in that moment

That everyone's together in that moment of your life
Frozen in a snow globe, spin so slowly like you're stuck in time, ah-ah, ah
When everyone's together in that moment of your life
All the tiny changes, pile up until you're snowed inside

You know I get cold
Moved away from home
Ran from the winter
I'm still your sister
Getting on the plane
Showing signs of age
Creased where we've smiled
I'm still your child

And everyone's together for a moment just today
Hold yourself together for a bit, before it slips away, ah-ah, ah, ah
When everyone's together for a moment just today
Let each silver second settle on your tongue and melt away, ayy, ayy, ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Ring around the year
End up right back here

"man"

I don't remember a single real thing about you
Just all of the sickness that you were supposed to see me through
And you're lucky as shit
The things I omit
Coz you stole more of me than I'd care to admit
So I can't remember all of the fucked shit that you'd do

So fuck all your gold stars
The cherries in the backyard
No amount of sugar could sweeten such a bitter heart
And fuck your soft boy scam
The cowboy or the Tarzan
No amount of nail polish coulda paint you a good man
Man

It's late at night when the sprinklers turn on as I'm leaving
And I don't know why every time I'm with you I lose feeling
I was already sick
When you called me your fix
Then I pushed mine aside to make room for your shit
I've spent life holding other people's aches in safe keeping

So fuck all your gold stars
The cherries in the backyard
No amount of sugar could sweeten such a bitter heart
And fuck your soft boy scam
The cowboy or the tarzan
No amount of nail polish coulda paint you a good man
Man
Man
Man

Man
Man
Man
Man

"security question"

Met you last night at some party I wandered to
Are you my friend now You follow me and I follow you
In the morning we pass quietly on the street
You won't ever get to know each face you see

Wish I could make a friend today
Wish I could know your first pet's name
You use in all of your passwords since you were a child
Wish I could ask "How was your day"
I wish I knew the person's name
You think of under the covers when you slip into the night

Hold the door for the person behind me, it's the only time
To show some warmth 'fore they brush past and swiftly return to their life
Could we lock eyes on the subway Fall in love today
Or hands in pockets, forget their face and look away

Wish I could make a friend today
Wish I could know your first pet's name
You use in all of your passwords since you were a child
Wish I could ask "How was your day"
I wish I knew the person's name
You think of under the covers when you slip into the night

We come so close
To changing each other all of the time
We come so close

"itch"

I swim 6 seas
Leave one waiting
To look forward to
Saw your future
I'm fidgeting
In the waiting room

And although
I'm oversaturated know I'm earnest too
And I know I'm eager
But I can't fucking wait for the day that I finally get to kiss you
Finally get to kiss you

What if I never scratched another
Itch for the rest of my life
Would I die
Satisfied
Knowing it can always get better than this

And although
I'm oversaturated know I'm earnest too
And I know
I'm eager but I swear I'm always true
Let go
A fact on a bottle cap, proof of god in your soup
Belly of a baby
Pearls against the tooth
A charm of living daylight napping in your room

What if I never scratched another
Itch for the rest of my life
Would I die
Satisfied
Knowing it can always get better than this

What if I never scratched another
Itch for the rest of my life
Would I die
Satisfied
Knowing it can always get better than this

"touch tank"

Canceled a hot hipster threesome for you
'Cause I preach of freedom, but you're a fucking great excuse
Plus I'd rather get naked and swim in your blow-up pool
And dry our dolphin bodies off and question your tattoos

'Cause he's so pretty when he goes down on me
Gold-skinned eager baby, blue shirt out the laundry
He tells me he's gentle when he wants to be
So I think he wants to be gentle with me

It's such a short drive to get to the touch tank
To you, deep sea pearl, my soft manta ray (Manta ray)
Tender two fingers to touch the display
I used to dive deep 'til I got splashed in the face

He's so pretty when he goes down on me
Gold-skinned eager baby, blue shirt out the laundry
He tells me he's gentle when he wants to be
So I think he wants to be gentle with me

You took my breath away
So now I can't suck in my stomach around you anymore
We're too old to live with our parents
Do you wanna wake up to me every morning
Every morning
Every morning
I'm swimming into you
I'll tumble to the ocean in a parachute
I am swimming into you
I'll tumble to the ocean

He's so pretty when he goes down on me
Gold-skinned eager baby, blue shirt out the laundry
He tells me he's gentle when he wants to be
So I think he wants to be gentle with me

"popcorn & juice"

I want to eat popcorn and juice on the last day of school
Watch a movie and sit in the dark
And stay up real late playing iPod touch games
Hope my parents don't peek on a lark

And fall asleep in the car after the water park
With the radio soft in your ears
August coppertone tan, crannies filled up with sand
And salt water still clogging your ears, ears

"get what u get"

I fantasize about being cut down to size
And telling you sweet goodbyes as I'm watching you cry

Then I'm walking through some door to a place to get well
Where I can be cared for in a white sterile cell

And I don't like to poeticize or double the gravity
'Cause what's broken inside can rattle about in me
The bad days remind and the good days forget
The burden is mine and you get what you get

"emblem"

Give me a sec to envelope in dark
Just wait for the lights in the sky to go low
I'll glow at the boardwalk, the sidewalk, the park
Tangling in mesh on my float down the road

A wet seed wild in the hot blind earth
You forget too often existence's worth
It's green in the fracture, fill in where it hurts
Shine and endure like you're gold in the dirt
Gold in the dirt
Gold in the dirt
Gold in the dirt
Gold in the dirt

The simplest joys are the ones most profound
A flyaway fractal, a dragonfly wing
Smooth stones from the beach and bolts found on the ground
Gems waiting for your eyes to see them gleaming

A wet seed wild in the hot blind earth
It's a holiday and you're ready to burst
We wrap up the lilacs in old newspaper
Everyone knows that you're gold in the dirt
Gold in the dirt
Gold in the dirt
Gold in the dirt
Gold in the dirt

The birds ate the pulp and they dropped down the seed
With intricate pattern down to the last cell
A stone from a peach, leave an emblem on me
Now I've got it all, why want anything else

Big bold true
Bright proud new
When you step out
The world steps in to meet you
Big bold true
Bright proud new
When you step out
The world steps in to meet you

"better"

I'll blame the mono I got freshman year
And I'll blame the dropping out all on my bright and burgeoning career
Though I've been worried tired for almost 10 years straight
Now I've got time to sit home alone and sing praise of the world I often hate

And I haven't felt right since that day
I met him publicly, he told me I was safe
But what's lost if I've never changed
And what he did to me is just another diddy I can play

I don't know why I don't wanna get better, I wanna stay the same
And I say that I'll figure it out once all of my songs are sang
Oh no, and I don't know why I don't wanna get better, I wanna stay the same
And I say that I'll figure it out once all of my songs are sang

I don't know why I don't wanna get better, I wanna stay the same
And I say that I'll figure it out once all of my songs are sang
Oh no, and I don't know why I don't wanna get better, I wanna stay the same
And I say that I'll figure it out once all of my songs are sang

"promised"

Face first in the public pool
Swerved off the interstate one night
Hurts most once you're home from school
You'd quit this out of spite

There's so many ways to call it a day
When you don't know where to go
Just let the little guy bright
In the crosswalk light
Guide you to where you need to go

Sometimes it's fortune
Sometimes it's fate
When you just miss the green light
But something's keeping you safe
While it's making you late
It's a wonder that you've made it all this time

At best you're the shape of you
In shadows on blinding flood light fields
That green apple shampoo
You're sculpted baby bell peels
You're dryer steam, you're someone's wet dream
Ice cream for a meal
You're singalongs to Christmas songs
Or a dog at your heels

Sleep long for the sheet prints it leaves on my face
Tomorrow isn't promised, but I woke today
I don't really care how long I get to stay
So long as I'm gone once I've felt everything

So long as I'm gone once I've felt everything

So long as I'm gone once I've felt everything

"flounder"

An artifact of human existence
Is fossilized inside of me
Lost languages, species forgotten
Under sediment beneath our feet

Now sugar babies, Mickey Mouse
Digitize your parents' house
Turns into the world we choose to see
But it made me heavy on the way
I fell down for a couple days
Flattened at the bottom of the sea

Now I'm a flounder
Flounder
Flounder, flounder
Now I'm a flounder
Flounder
Flounder, flounder

I'm trapped inside my frame of sight
So much wonder that I cannot see
Though I've only got eyes on one side
It isn't any less real to me

Now money talks but I can scream
Look at all this blue and green
Blend into the seashell in your hand
And I don't mind to devolve a bit
Learn to love the simple shit
Forget we sprouted legs and walked the sand

So I'm a flounder
Flounder
Flounder, flounder
So I'm a flounder
Flounder
Flounder, flounder

Now I'm happy I can be myself
Instead of somebody else
I'd never trade the beauty that I've seen

"jake's car"

It doesn't rain here, but I swear I thought it was beating
Last night on the AC that's been there ever since we moved in
And I go outside in dad's coat and the clothes that I slept in
And wave at the neighbors, the old guy next door thinks I'm flirting

And I can see all the way down the street in the early morning
When I borrow Jake's car 'cause I drive but I can't afford it
Yet

"fade"

I end up alone every night when you fall asleep next to me
It's nice to have you by my side to keep my body company

But I forged this
My creation
If it's not here it must be fake
'Cause sometimes
The backdrop
Seems to slip off and start to

Fade
Fade
Fade
Fade

I don't know how to use my words this time there's nothing coming out
You'd have to crawl inside to understand and peer out of my mouth

This dream I've
Been living
Has lasted one too many days
And somehow
I'm scared that
This feelings never gonna

Fade
Fade
Fade
Fade
Fade
Fade
Fade

"shape"

Seven years is all it takes
To completely exfoliate
Cells die off, regenerate
Leave a reminiscent shape

So, if I can wait five more
In this shape that I abhor
I'll sleep with an open door
Knowing you haven't touched a cell on my body
On my body
On my body
On my body

Now, my love carries the task
Of handling the aftermath
Can you smooth the looping lines
Of fingerprints before your time

Patience with the jagged grooves
Of relics that I can't remove
Worn thin, washing up to you
Kiss me till the cells are new on my body
On my body
On my body
On my body

On my body
On my body
On my body
On my body

"ribbons"

I took off my clothes and ribbons
To see what it looks like, oh
I took off the face paint, no shame
It looks alright, oh

I wore the same clothes
Ten days in a row
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten)
Seems like I'm the same
But I don't know

I'm tired of pretty dresses
I'm tired of clean white linens
I'm tired of pretty dresses
I'm tired of tying ribbons, oh, oh

I'm the smell of a coat from out
In the cold, mmh
I'm a frozen mandarin skin
Frosty gold, oh

No fun to be sexy
On the websites
When I'm always
Shining the light

I'm tired of pretty dresses
I'm tired of clean white linens
I'm tired of pretty dresses
I'm tired of tying ribbons, oh, oh

For as much as I'd like to vaporize
Sometimes I'm happy as a clam
Because I am
Ooh

I'm tired of pretty dresses
I'm tired of clean white linens
I'm tired of pretty dresses
I'm tired of tying ribbons

I'm tired of pretty dresses
I'm tired of clean white linens
I'm tired of pretty dresses
I'm tired of tying ribbons
I'm tired of pretty dresses
I'm tired of clean white linens
I'm tired of pretty dresses
I'm tired of tying ribbons, oh, oh

"gold ring"

Oh he took me up
To the meadow above
And I parked at the lot down the street
Oh he took me up
And I said hes out of luck
But he stole a little fragment of me

It's a hand print
Indent on your sidewalk
Baked under the hot sun
Branded on your skin
It's a gold ring
Deep inside a junk drawer
Maybe it's forever
Maybe I'm not sure

Oh salt in the sea
Waves take cliffs more strong than me
So I'd ask could you be kind to what remains
Oh sliver of grief
Little stolen puzzle piece
Where I let the light shine through me every day

It's a hand print
Indent on your sidewalk
Baked under the hot sun
Branded on your skin
It's a gold ring
Deep inside a junk drawer
Maybe it's forever
Maybe I'm not sure

It's a hand print
Indent on your sidewalk
Baked under the hot sun
Branded on your skin
It's a gold ring
Deep inside a junk drawer
Maybe it's forever
Maybe I'm not sure

"flutterby"

Angel hair and butter eyes
I sit like a paradigm
I can stomach cold french fries
But I can't show it to him yet
Do I read him as a threat
I can't show it to him yet

There's a moat on all my sides
You can't cross but always try
Only costs a pair of dimes
To fake you took off all my skin
I laugh silent with a grin
There is nothing stored within

I can't seem to verbalize
So he visits late at night
Tries so hard to get me high
When I wanna go to bed
But you're not finished yet
I just wanna go to bed
But you're not finished yet
I just wanna go to bed

Say he gives you butterflies
But sometimes that's just your insides
Telling you to flutterby
Maybe something isn't right
Can I stay here for the night
Feels like something isn't right

"miss u but"

I was up 'till three
Sewing patches on my jeans
'Cos you don't kiss the bruises on my knees
Anymore
Hear you're fixating someone new
How you made me fixate on you
I miss you but I'm not allowed to
Anymore

Your new girl, she's got a name just like a song
And I wouldn't blame u if u sing it all night long
Your new girl, she's got a name just like a prayer
I couldn't blame you if you incant it everywhere

And I'm texting you at night time
And I hear its not the right time
Anymore
And I'm not dumb I'm just a kid
The worlds too small, my heart too big
They say I can't care what you did
Anymore

Your new girl, she's got a name just like a song
And I wouldn't blame you if you sing it all night long
Your new girl, she's got a name just like a prayer
I couldn't blame you if you incant it everywhere

"pity party"

Leave me at the pity party
Leave me at the pity party

Please don't drive me home tonight
I wouldn't want to ruin your fun
Im anybody's parasite
And your not just anyone

Leave me at the pity party
Leave me at the pity party
Leave me at the pity party
Leave me at the...

In the bathtub you talk to me
Tell me who treats me wrong
Outside they've got people to be
We try to not belong

Leave me at the pity party
Leave me at the pity party
Leave me at the pity party
Leave me at the...

Please don't drive me home tonight
Please don't drive me home tonight

"spilt milk"

And since when do we find well fed lovers on our minds and in our covers, kitchen, sitting watching you consume the things you need

Sitting pretty I believed that interesting means misery as lovers rot away mouth to my hand from which to feed

And staring at your shark tooth smile I recall that its been a while since you said that you think I look like that celebrity

And I'll say love me lingering, despite this constant dwindling as I am learning quickly you seek no dependency

Getting off on my guilt
Guess thats just how I'm built
You know where to find me I'll be sipping on that spilt milk

Getting off on my guilt
Guess thats just how I'm built
You know where to find me I'll be sipping on that spilt milk

Getting off on my guilt
Guess thats just how I'm built
You know where to find me I'll be sipping on that spilt milk

Getting off on my guilt
Guess thats just how I'm built
You know where to find me I'll be sipping on that spilt milk

"The June Haverly"

June Haverly,
You always get your way,
But June Haverly,
Not today, no not today

You're on top of the world,
Just trynna stay on track,
And they'll kiss your feet while they stab your back,
And watch you started burn to blazing crying

June Haverly,
You always got your way,
But not today, no not today
No not today

June Haverly,
You're not to blame,
No not to blame
And June Haverly,
Don't be ashamed,
For all the pain

You're on top of the world,
Just trynna stay on track,
And they'll kiss your feet while they stab your back,
And watch you started burn to blazing crying

June Haverly,
We miss you so
Why'd you go
Oh why'd you go

You're on top of the world,
Just trynna stay on track,
And they'll kiss your feet while they stab your back,
And watch you started burn to blazing crying

June Haverly,
We miss you so
Why'd you go
Oh why'd you go

"She's 22"

Shes 22, and shes loving you
and youll never know how it makes me blue,
does she make you happy

Im holding on, to a thing thats wrong
cause we dont belong,
you like my songs and it makes me happy
does she make you happy

You can throw away, every word I say

Im standing still, on this hidden hill,
and Im looking around for the right way down,
to your distant valley,
your flowers grow, in the frozen snow and Id like to know is it all a show,
are you really happy [x2]

Cause you can throw away, every word I say
You just throw away

"Make You Love Me"

Well I can't make you love me, but I'll try
Oh the Lord knows how hard I'll try
I can't make you need me, but I'll try
Oh the Lord knows how hard I'll try

But when the su-u-u-un starts to set 
And when the ski-i-i-ies take your breath
And I need to sense you, right there
You just wave goodbye, wave goodbye

Well I can't make you love me, but I'll try
Until my dying breath, you know I'll try
I can't make you feel it, if it's not there
Only the Lord knows why it's not there

But when the su-u-u-un starts to set 
And when the ski-i-i-ies take your breath
And I need to sense you, right there
You just wave goodbye, wave goodbye

I can't make you love me, yeah
I can't make you love me 
(I can't make you love me)

But when the su-u-u-un starts to set 
And when the ski-i-i-ies take your breath
And I need to sense you, right there
You just wave goodbye, wave goodbye
(You just wave goodbye)

"Happy Little Pill"

In the crowd alone
And every second passing reminds me I'm not home
Bright lights and city sounds are ringing like a drone
Unknown, unknown

Oh, glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills
And...

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Tame my hunger
Light within
Numb my skin

Like a rock I float
Sweat and conversations seep into my bones
Four walls are not enough
I'll take a dip into the unknown, unknown

Oh, glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills
And...

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Tame my hunger
Light within
Numb my skin

Glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills
And...

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Tame my hunger
Light within
Numb my skin

"Touch"

Glow is low and it's dimming
And the silence is ringing
And I can almost feel your breath
I can almost feel the rest

Night is young and we're living
Hands move, moving steady
And the time is moving slower
I can feel we're getting closer, closer

Standing in the eye of the storm
My eyes start to roam
To the curl of your lips
In the center of eclipse
In total darkness I, I reach out and touch

My mind's gone on racing
On a horse that's escaping
And I'm ready to jump,
Yeah, I'm ready to swim

Life is chances that are taken
But nothing's ever broken
They're just pieces on the ground
New hands need to build them

My mind's gone on running
My hands cut loose
Yeah, but there's no need for answers
Just the things you gotta do

And I need you to trust
That I'm lost and we must
Get past all these rules
We must choose
To reach out and touch

Standing in the eye of the storm
My eyes start to roam
To the curl of your lips
In the center of eclipse
In total darkness I, reach out and...

Standing in the eye of the storm
My eyes start to roam
To the curl of your lips
In the center of eclipse
In total darkness I reach, I reach out and touch

"Fun"

But don't you wanna see the world, boy
All the countries and the stars, boy
Just don't look them in the eyes, boy
You just gotta take their lives, boy
Let me take you for a drive, boy
Oh I swear you'll feel alive, boy

All you gotta do is trust that I'm being true
And do it for the people who love you

Let's go have fun, you and me in the old Jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun
You and me in the old Jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun

Listen to what I tell you
You'll see, my son
Now you know what you gotta do
Let's go have fun

When you're standing on the line, boy
Don't go looking for goodbye, boy
Yeah, you gotta set them free, boy
'Cause you know that's what they need, boy
Yeah, you're gonna make them proud, boy
'Til they put you in the ground, boy

All you gotta do is trust that I'm being true
And do it for the people who love you

Let's go have fun, you and me in the old Jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun,
You and me in the old Jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun

Listen to what I tell you
You'll see, my son
Now you know what you gotta do
Let's go have fun
Let's go have fun

Let's go have fun, you and me in the old Jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun
You and me in the old Jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun

Fun, you and me in the old Jeep,
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun
You and me in the old Jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun

"Gasoline"

I smell heartbreak on my hands
I feel sick to my stomach as I begin to stand
I see your outline in my bed
In the same spot I watched him rest his head

I've done you wrong, I regret it
I write this song, try to forget it
I feel this emptiness in my chest
It feels surreal, but I'm feeling stressed

I need to do something
I fucked up for nothing
Now I gotta just tell someone
Tell someone what I've done

Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline
Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline
Oh, no, like gasoline

Wake up the morning after
You call but I don't answer
And I can't look you in the eye
No matter how hard I try

You deserve forever
not a boy looking for better
But as long as you're still here
I'mma try to keep you near

Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline
Bathe me now, yeah, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline

Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline
Bathe me now, yeah, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline

Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, just like gasoline

"The Fault In Our Stars (MMIV)"

[Verse 1]
The weight
Of a simple human emotion
Weighs me down
More than the tank ever did

The pain
It's determined and demanding
To ache, but I'm okay...

[Chorus]
And I don't want to let this go
I don't want to lose control
I just want to see the stars with you

And I don't want to say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just want to see the stars with you

[Verse 2]
You lost, a part of your existence
In the war, against yourself
Oh, the lights,
They light up in lights of sadness
Telling you, it's time to go

[Chorus]
And I don't want to let this go
I don't want to lose control
I just want to see the stars with you

And I don't want to say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just want to see the stars with you

[Bridge x3]
Don't give it up just yet stay grand
For one more minute, don't give it up just yet
Stay grand

[Chorus]
(I don't want to let) And I don't want to let this go
(I don't want to lose) I don't want to lose control
(And I just want to see) I just want to see the stars (the stars with you) with you

And I don't want to say (don't want to say) goodbye
Someone tell me why (tell me why)
I just want to see the stars (the stars with you) with you

With you

"WILD"

(Wild, wild, hey)

Trying hard not to fall
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down, down
Kissing up on fences
And up on walls
On the way home
I guess it's all working out, now

'Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh

Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild

'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild

You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild

(Wild, wild, hey)

White noise in my mind
Won't calm down
You're all I think about

Running on the music
And night highs
But when the light's out
It's me and you now, now

'Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild

'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild

You're driving me wild, wild, wild [4x]

You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild

You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild

(Hey)
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh (hey)
And it drives me wild (hey, hey)

'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh (hey)
It drives me wild (hey)

You're driving me wild, wild, wild [4x]
(Hey, hey)

(Wild, wild, wild, hey)

"BITE"

Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Sing me like a choir
I can be the subject of your dreams
Your sickening desire
Don't you want to see a man up close
A phoenix in the fire

So kiss me on the mouth and set me free
But please don't bite

You can coax the cold right out of me
Drape me in your warmth
The rapture in the dark puts me at ease
The blind eye of the storm
Let's go for a walk down Easy Street
Where you can be reborn

And kiss me on the mouth and set me free
But please, don't bite

Aah, I'm pulling on your heart to push my luck
Aah, cause who's got any time for growin' up
Kiss me on the mouth... 
Kiss me on the mouth...
Kiss me, kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free

Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Sing me like a choir
I can be the subject of your dreams
Your sickening desire
Don't you wanna see a man up close
A phoenix in the fire

So kiss me on the mouth and set me free
But please don't bite

"FOOLS"

I am tired of this place, I hope people change
I need time to replace what I gave away
And my hopes, they are high, I must keep them small
Though I try to resist I still want it all

I see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
I see a little house on a hill and children's names
I see quiet nights poured over ice and Tanqueray
But everything is shattering and it's my mistake

Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

Oh, our lives don't collide, I'm aware of this
We've got differences and impulses and your obsession with
The little things, you like stick, and I like aerosol
I don't give a fuck, I'm not giving up, I still want it all

Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

I see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
I see a little house on a hill and children's names
I see quiet nights poured over ice and Tanqueray
But everything is shattering and it's my mistake

Only fools fall for you, only fools fall
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools fall
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools
Only fools
Only fools
Only fools

"EASE"
(feat. Broods)

[Troye Sivan]
I'm down to my skin and bone
And my mommy, she can't put down the phone
And stop asking how I'm doing all alone, alone
But the truth is the stars are falling, ma
And the wolves are out c-calling, ma
And my home has never felt this far

[Troye Sivan & Georgia Nott]
But all this driving
Is driving me crazy
And all this moving
Is proving to get the best of me
And I've been trying to hide it
But lately
Every time I think I'm better
Pickin' my head up, getting nowhere

[Troye Sivan & Georgia Nott]
Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

[Troye Sivan & Georgia Nott]
Now I'm down to my skin and bones
My baby listens to me on the phone
But I can't help feeling like I'm all alone, all alone
The truth is, the stars are falling, babe
And I'd never ever thought that I would say
I'm afraid of the life that I've made, I've made

[Troye Sivan & Georgia Nott]
But all this driving
Is driving me crazy
And all this moving
Is proving to get the best of me
And I've been trying to hide it
But lately
Every time I think I'm better
Pickin' my head up, getting nowhere

Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

[Georgia Nott]
I've been lyin' to them all
I don't need it anymore
Don't you worry about me
I'll be fine if I can breathe
I've been out here for too long
Taking shit for how I'm wrong
How I'm wrong
Always wrong

[Troye Sivan & Georgia Nott]
Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
(Take me back to the basics and the simple life)
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
(Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease)
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
(Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby)
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

"THE QUIET"

Growing distance free of explanation
We're getting deeper in this mess
Take careful contemplation
I'd rather be spitting blood
Than have this silence fuck me up

This separation,
time and space between us
For some revelation
You didn't care to discuss
I'd rather be black and blue
Than accept that you withdrew

Aaah, just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet
Just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet

Used to give each other the world, every bit
I used to be the one you'd come to
When it'd all go to shit
Now I'm left here in the dust
With the taste of broken trust

And I don't wanna walk away
But you left me no choice
Only talking to myself here
Now you've muffled your voice
I'd rather have broken bones
Than feel myself turn to stone

Aaah, just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet
Just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet

I don't mind that I know that you're wrong
I don't mind that you think you're right
All I want is a fight to fight
Anything but quiet

Just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet

"DKLA"
(feat. Tkay Maidza)

Wrapped my thoughts around your mind
Wrapped your body around mine

Play it back then press rewind
To when you traced your fingers drew my spine
Lost its beat and so I find
I starve my heart of touch and time

So what do I do now
I don't keep love around
What do I do now
I don't keep love around
What do I do now
I don't keep love around, love around
Love around, love around

When we tried it, we were a fire with no smoke
Rags to riches but I'm addicted to being broken
Take my breath away, you know I'm bound to choke
When I close my eyes I still see your ghost

So what do I do now
I don't keep love around
What do I do now
I don't keep love around
What do I do now
I don't keep love around, love around
Love around, love around

I don't keep love around
I don't keep love around
Ooh yeah, I don't keep love around
Love around
Love around

[Tkay Maidza]
They can't stand, I handstand
I don't hold on right anymore
Pleased to meet you, I'm kinda' moved
But that last one was my antidote
Green eyes, become green times
But there is no first or a last chance
They're telling me to turn down
'Cause I'm so lit, recall flashdance
Only A1, and I stay 1
And I'm counting out for that day when
Residuals become imminent
'Cause failure is not pivotal
They just be asking the same
Try switch it up, I switch lanes
No love in this world, I'm still sane
Right Because that's enough
When the lights on
And you don't keep love

[Troye Sivan]
'Distance makes the heart grow fonder'
Said by someone stronger than me
So what do I do now
Do now
So what do I do now
I don't keep love around anymore
I don't keep love around anymore
I don't keep, I don't keep
Love around

"TALK ME DOWN"

I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now
And I wanna come home to you
But home is just a room full of my safest sounds
Cause you know that I can't trust myself with my 3AM shadow
I'd rather fuel a fantasy than deal with this alone

I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now
So come over now and talk me down

I wanna hold hands with you
But that's all I wanna do right now
And I wanna get close to you
Cause your hands and lips still know their way around
And I know I like to draw that line, when it starts to get too real
But the less time that I spend with you, the less you need to heal

I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now
So come over now and talk me down
(talk me down)

So if you don't mind, I'll walk that line
Stuck on the bridge between us
Gray areas and expectations
But I'm not the one if we're honest, yeah
But I wanna sleep next to you
And I wanna come home to you
I wanna hold hands with you
I wanna be close to you

But I wanna sleep next to you
And that's all I wanna do right now
And I wanna come home to you
But home is just a room full of my safest sounds
So come over now and talk me down
(talk me down)

"COOL"

Sweet life livin'
Pools and swimming
Drinks in bars and
Boys in cars and
Rooftop sinning
Skinny dipping
Shooting stars
With fat cigars

And that weekend up in the islands
They stop and stare
Flashes filling the silence
Of a Hollywood love affair
Waking up in the islands
Cause I saw you there
Lost and trying to be

I was just trying to be cool
I was just trying to be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do

Mansion debut
Love it, do you
Absent father
Pays his daughter
And her mama withdrew
From the life they once knew
She had a heart, but
She sold it off for

That weekend up in the islands
They stop and stare
Flashes filling the silence
Of a Hollywood love affair
Waking up in the islands
Cause I saw you there
Lost and trying to be

I was just trying to be cool
I was just trying to be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do

When I've got that cigarette smoke
And Saint Laurent coat, but nothing is feeling right
I drink but I choke
I love but I don't, yeah

I was just trying to be cool
I was just trying to be like you

I was just trying to be cool
I was just trying to be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do

When I've got that cigarette smoke
And Saint Laurent coat, but nothing is feeling right
I drink but I choke
I love but I don't, yeah

I was just trying to be cool
I was just trying to be like you

"HEAVEN"
(feat. Betty Who)

The truth runs wild
Like a tear down a cheek
Trying to save face, and daddy heart break
I'm lying through my teeth

This voice inside
Has been eating at me
Trying to replace the love that I fake
With what we both need

The truth runs wild
Like kids on concrete
Trying to sedate my mind in its cage
And numb what I see

Awake, wide eyed
I'm screaming at me
Trying to keep faith and picture his face
Staring up at me

Without losing a piece of me
How do I get to heaven
Without changing a part of me
How do I get to heaven
All my time is wasted
Feeling like my heart's mistaken, oh
So if I'm losing a piece of me
Maybe I don't want heaven

[Betty Who]
The truth runs wild
Like the rain to the sea
Trying to set straight the lines that I trace
To find some relief
This voice inside
Has been eating at me

Trying to embrace the picture I paint
And colour me free

Without losing a piece of me
How do I get to heaven
Without changing a part of me
How do I get to heaven
All my time is wasted
Feeling like my heart's mistaken, oh
So if I'm losing a piece of me
Maybe I don't want heaven

So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen, counting to fifteen
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen, counting to fifteen
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen, counting to fifteen
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen, counting to fifteen

Without losing a piece of me
How do I get to heaven
Without changing a part of me
How do I get to heaven
All my time is wasted
Feeling like my heart's mistaken, oh
So if I'm losing a piece of me
Maybe I don't want heaven

The truth runs wild
Like a tear down a cheek

"YOUTH"

What if
What if we run away
What if
What if we left today
What if
We said goodbye to safe and sound
What if
What if we're hard to find
What if
What if we lost our minds
What if
We let them fall behind, and they're never found

And when the lights start flashing like a photo booth
And the stars exploding
We'll be fireproof

My youth
My youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth
My youth is yours
Run away now and forevermore
My youth
My youth is yours
The truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

What if
What if we start to drive
What if
What if we close our eyes
What if
We're speeding through red lights into paradise
'Cause we've no time for getting old
Mortal body, timeless souls
Cross your fingers, here we go
Oh, oh, oh

And when the lights start flashing like a photo booth
And the stars exploding
We'll be fireproof

My youth
My youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth
My youth is yours
Run away now and forevermore
My youth
My youth is yours
The truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours
My youth is yours

My youth
My youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth
My youth is yours
Run away now and forevermore
My youth
My youth is yours
The truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours
Oh, oh, oh
My youth is yours
Oh, oh, oh
My youth is yours

"LOST BOY"

As the smile fell from your face, I fell with it
Our faces blue
There's a heart stain on the carpet
I left it, I left it with you

Yeah, the truth is that I'm sorry
Though I told you not to worry
I'm just some dumb kid
Trying to kid myself
That I got my shit together

So go get runnin', won't you hurry
While it's light out, while it's early
Before I start to miss any part of this
And change my mind, whatever

I say I wanna settle down
Build your hopes up like a tower
I'm giving you the run around
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found
Not ready to be found
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found

I don't care much for locks on the window
To keep me at bay
I'll leave you one last kiss on your pillow
'Fore I fly away

Yeah, we knew from the beginning
That this wasn't never ending
Shouldn't stay too long
'Cause we're both too young
To give into forever

I say I wanna settle down
Build your hopes up like a tower
I'm giving you the run around
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found
Not ready to be found
I'm just a lost boy

So what are you waiting for
'Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy

So what are you waiting for
'Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy

So what are you waiting for
'Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy

So what are you waiting for
'Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy

I say I wanna settle down
Build your hopes up like a tower
I'm giving you the run around
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found
Not ready to be found
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found

"for him."
(feat. Allday)

We are runnin' so fast
And we never look back
And whatever I lack, you make up
We make a really good team
Though not everyone sees
We got this crazy chemistry
Between us

Jump starting your car 'cause this city's a bore
Buying e-cigarettes at the convenience store
Making new clichs on our own little tour
Let's ride

You don't have to say, "I love you," to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you, you

We try staying up late
But we both are light weights
Yeah we get off our face, too easy
And we take jokes way too far
'Cause sometimes living's too hard
We're like two halves of one heart
We are, we are, we are

You don't have to say, "I love you," to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you, you

[Verse three by AllDay]
Eat a pill stay and chill, you don't need to go
I'm about to bring emo back if you leave my home
I'd Panic at the Disco and you'd rather watch a TV show
Then I'll squeeze your booty real hard like I'm kneading dough
Pizza boy, I'm speeding for ya
We can get married tonight if you really wanna
Me in a cheap suit like a sleazy lawyer
And if you break this little heart, it'd be an honour

[Alternative verse three by Troye Sivan]
We're not a commercial for anyone else
We go out for coffee
And keep it to ourselves
We make little homes out of three-star hotels
And I know what you're feeling
'Cause I feel it as well

You don't have to say, "I love you," to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you, you

"SUBURBIA"

[Verse 1]
The sun sets longer
Where I am from
Where dreams go to die
While having fun
The boys fix their cars and
Girls eat it up
Loving's so good when
Love is young

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, there's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
There's so much history in my head
The people I've left
The ones that I've kept

[Chorus]
Have you heard me on the radio
Did you turn it up
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Of suburbia

[Verse 2]
Swallow nostalgia
Chase it with lime
Better than dwelling
And chasing time
Missing occasions
I can't rewind
Can't help but feel I've lost what's mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, there's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
There's so much history in my head
The people I've left
The ones that I've kept

[Chorus]
Have you heard me on the radio
Did you turn it up
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Of suburbia

[Bridge]
They all say that nothing ever changes
Through the new lines that are on their faces
They all say that nothing ever changes
Through the new lines that are on their faces

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, there's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
There's so much history in my head
The people I've left
The ones that I've kept

[Chorus]
Have you heard me on the radio
Did you turn it up
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Of suburbia

"TOO GOOD"

Scared my love, you'll go
Spend my love, heart broke
So my love don't show
Scared my love, you'll go

Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
All I need

Fingers walk your thigh
Breathe my love, get high
And oh, I'm so scared
Oh I'm so scared
It's just for tonight

So I take a sip, wait 'til it hits
That liquid guilt is on my lips
I'm wasted on you

Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
All I need

So I take a sip, wait 'til it hits
That liquid guilt is on my lips
I'm wasted on you
(Wasted on you)

Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
All I need

"BLUE"
(feat. Alex Hope)

Love hits hard, I know
All your lights are red, but I'm green to go
Used to see you high, now you're only low
All your lights are red but I'm green to go

I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you
I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you

I can't say no
Though the lights are on
There's nobody home
Swore I'd never lose control
Then I fell in love with a heart that beats so slow

I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you
I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you

I know you're seeing black and white
So I'll paint you a clear blue sky
Without you I am colour-blind
It's raining every time I open my eyes
I know you're seeing black and white
So I'll paint you a clear blue sky
Without you I am colour-blind
It's raining every time I open my eyes

I want you
I'll colour me blue
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you
When I'm looking up at you

I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you
I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you

I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you

"WILD (YY Remix)"

(Heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me)

Trying hard not to fall
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down
Kissing up on fences
And up on walls
On the way home
I guess it's all working out, now

'Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

You're driving me

White noise in my mind
Won't calm down
You're all I think about
Running on the music
And night highs
But when the light's out
It's me and you now, now

'Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Wanted to
Wanted to be, be, bad
Never, ever
Driving me wild
Wanted to
Wanted to be, be, bad

"SWIMMING POOLS"

I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run

So tell me how I'm gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools
Cause I just wanna be at the start of after loving you
I plant my feet and I clench my teeth
I can't outrun what's coming after me
So tell me how I'm gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools

But I see a lighthouse in the distance calling my name
But I can't get there 'til I go through all of this pain
There's a glimmer of hope like an exhale of smoke in the sky
And sometimes you drain out all the shit that used to feel right
Empty swimming pools

I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run

So tell me how I'm gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools
Tell me how I'm gonna feel less secure when I look at you
So I close my eyes and just visualize
The greenest grass on the other side
So tell me how I'm gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools

But I see a lighthouse in the distance calling my name
But I can't get there 'til I go through all of this pain
There's a glimmer of hope like an exhale of smoke in the sky
And sometimes you drain out all the shit that used to feel right
Empty swimming pools
Empty swimming pools
Empty swimming pools
Empty swimming pools

I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run

"EASE (Vallis Alps Remix)"
(feat. Broods)

Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

I'm down to my skin and bone
And my mommy, she can't put down the phone
And stop asking how I'm doing all alone, alone
But the truth is the stars are falling, ma
And the wolves are out calling, ma
And my home has never felt this far

But all this driving
Is driving me crazy
And all this moving
Is proving to get the best of me
And I've been trying to hide it
But lately
Every time I think I'm better
Pickin' my head up, getting nowhere

Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
The truth is...

(I've been lying to them all
I don't need it anymore
Don't you worry about me
I'll be fine if I can breath
I've been hidin' for too long
Taking shit for how I'm wrong
How I'm wrong
Always wrong)

"EASE (Lontalius Remix)"

Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

Now I'm down to my skin and bones
My baby listens to me on the phone
But I can't help feeling like I'm all alone, all alone
The truth is, the stars are falling, babe
And I'd never ever thought that I would say
I'm afraid of the life that I've made, I've made

But all this driving
Is driving me crazy
And all this moving
Is proving to get the best of me
And I've been trying to hide it
But lately
Every time I think I'm better
Pickin' my head up, getting nowhere

Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

I've been lyin' to them all
I don't need it anymore
Don't you worry about me
I'll be fine if I can breathe
I've been hidin' for too long
Taking shit for how I'm wrong
How I'm wrong
Always wrong

Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

"FOOLS (Filous Remix)"

I am tired of this place, I hope people change
I need time to replace what I gave away
And my hopes, they are high, I must keep them small
Though I try to resist I still want it all

I see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
I see a little house on the hill and children's names
I see quiet nights poured over ice and Tanqueray
But everything is shattering and it's my mistake

Only fools...
(You, you, you)

Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

I am tired of this place, I hope people change
I need time to replace what I gave away
And my hopes, they are high, I must keep them small
Though I try to resist I still want it all

I see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
I see a little house on the hill and children's names
I see quiet nights poured over ice and Tanqueray
But everything is shattering and it's my mistake

Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

What if, what if we run away
What if, what if we left today
What if we said goodbye to safe and sound
And what if, what if we're hard to find
What if, what if we lost our minds
What if we let them fall behind and they're never found

In the crowd, alone
And every second passing
Reminds me I'm not home
Bright lights and city sounds
Are ringing like a drone
Unknown, unknown

All glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills and

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin

Like a rock, I float
Sweat and conversations
Seep into my bone
Four walls are not enough
I'll take a dip into the
Unknown, unknown

All glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills and

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin, yeah

Bright lights, remember bright lights, bright lights
These bright lights, see these bright lights bright lights
Yeah all of these bright lights, they numb my skin
Oh yeah

Oh, all the glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, and dollar bills and

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin baby

Bright lights, remember bright lights, bright lights
Yeah all of these bright lights, they numb my skin
Oh, oh, I see again

"Seventeen"

I got these beliefs that I think you wanna break
Got something here to lose that I think you wanna take from me
You say that I'm asleep but I wanna be awake
Got something here to lose that I know you wanna take

And he said age is just a number, just like any other
We can do whatever, do whatever you want
Boy becomes a man now
Can't tell a man to slow down
He'll just do whatever, do whatever he wants

I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, seventeen

You should know I'm green but I'll find my way around
Heard the whispers, now let's see what all the talk's about
I'm taking in the sights and measuring the sounds
Heard the whispers, now let's see what all the talk's about

And he said age is just a number, just like any other
We can do whatever, do whatever you want
Boy becomes a man now
Can't tell a man to slow down
He'll just do whatever, do whatever he wants

I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, seventeen...

I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, seventeen
I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, seventeen...

"MY MY MY"

Shine on, diamond
Don't make me wait another day
'Cause passion is passion
You know it just as well as me

Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move

Spark up, buzz cut
I got my tongue between your teeth
Go slow, no, no, go fast
You like it just as much as me

Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

Oh my, my, my

Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my

Should be the last night ever
Should be the last night we're apart
Got my name on this treasure
On this treasure

Oh my, my, my
(Oh my, my)
I die every night with you
(I die, I die, I die, I die, yeah, yeah)
Oh my, my, my

"The Good Side"

I got the good side of things
Left you with both of the rings
My fingers danced and swayed in the breeze
The change in the wind took you down to your knees
I got the good side of you
Send it out into the blue
The people danced to the sound of your heart
The world sang along to it falling apart

But I sympathize
And I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

I got the good side of life
Travelled the universe twice
So many thoughts I wanted to share
But I didn't call because it wouldn't be fair
Then I got the good side of new
Found arms to fall right into
I know how it looked, it wasn't the plan
And some day I hope that you'll understand

That I sympathize
And I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

I'm sure we'll meet in the spring
And catch up on everything
I'll say I'm proud of all that you've done
You taught me the ropes, and you taught me to love

But I sympathize
And I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things
Sympathize
Recognize
Apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

"Postcard"
(feat. Gordi)

I sent you a postcard from Tokyo baby
You never picked it up
I even wrote it in Japanese, baby
You didn't give a fuck

'Cause I don't sleep like your body's on me
I won't feel right until we can be
Underneath everything that's between, yeah
I'm undone about to burst at my seams
'Cause I am picturing you beside me
So let me be everything that you need, yeah

But you're still picking me up
Don't put me back down like it's nothing to ya
You're still picking me up
Don't you put me back down
Don't you put me back down
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya

I remember that night when you first called me crazy
Only you picked it up
Kissed me and said "I love you, baby"
You didn't give a fuck

Now I don't sleep unless your body's on me
I won't feel right until we can be
Underneath everything that's between, yeah
I'm undone about to burst at my seams
'Cause I am picturing you beside me
So let me be everything that you need, yeah

But you're still picking me up
Don't put me back down like it's nothing to ya
You're still picking me up
Don't you put me back down
Don't you put me back down
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya

Take your time
Pull me in, push me out
Simplify all the whispers you doubt
'Cause I know what you're thinking about

But you're still picking me up
Don't put me back down like it's nothing to ya
You're still picking me up
Don't you put me back down
Don't you put me back down
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya

"Plum"

Watching you sleep
Run my hands through your hair and it's got me thinking
What you mean to me
There's a chill in the air and a sinking feeling
Coming over me
Like bitter tangerine
Like sirens in the streets
Oh no

Maybe our time has come
Maybe we're overgrown
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
Baby, we're barely holding on
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long

Jealous you can sleep
You've been keeping me up and I mouth the words
I think I wanna speak
Instead I'm wasting my time just pressing rewind
To all the nights we shared
The ripest peach or pear
But change is in the air, oh

Maybe our time has come
Maybe we're overgrown
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
Baby, we're barely holding on
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long

I was summer, you were spring
You can't change what the seasons bring
Yeah, I was summer and you were spring
You can't change what the seasons bring

Maybe our time has come
Maybe we're overgrown
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
Baby, we're barely holding on
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long

"What A Heavenly Way To Die"

Tell each other you're the one
While we're laying by the poolside, poolside
Getting tired from the sun
Fading in and out of long nights, long nights
There's no limit to your love
East or west we got the north lights, north lights, oh-oh
Take in it a-all

What a heavenly way to die
What a time to be alive
Because forever is in your eyes
But forever ain't half the time

I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you

When our prime has come and gone
And our youth is all but melted, melted
We can listen to this song
So we don't have to accept it, accept it
Just as long as you'll be home
In the one we've manifested-fested
Oh-oh, just take in it a-all

What a heavenly way to die
What a time to be alive
Because forever is in your eyes
But forever ain't half the time

I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you

Just take in it all-all-all-all
Just take in it all-all-all-all
Just take in it all-all-all-all
Just take in it all-all-all-all

What a heavenly way to die
What a time to be alive
Because forever is in your eyes
But forever ain't half the time

I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you

"Lucky Strike"

Oh, I want to know just how to love you
The jewel of California
Oh, I want to skip stones on your skin, boy
And drown me in your water

And my boy like a queen
Unlike one you've ever seen
He knows how to love me better
A hit of dopamine, higher than I've ever been
He knows how to love me better

Cause you're safe like spring time
Short days, long nights, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you
Cause you taste like Lucky Strikes
You drag, I light, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you
Tell me all the ways to love you
Tell me all the ways to love you

Oh, I wanna tip toe through your bliss, boy
Get lost the more I find ya
Oh (na na na na), don't wanna miss a second of this, boy
Hold tight and love me longer

And my boy like a queen
Unlike one you've ever seen
He knows how to love me better
A hit of dopamine, higher than I've ever been
He knows how to love me better

Cause you're safe like spring time
Short days, long nights, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you
Cause you taste like Lucky Strikes
You drag, I light, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you

"Animal"

I told you something safe
Something I've never said before
And I, I, I, can't keep my hands off you
While you lie in the wake
Covered all in the night before
I'm high, high, high, no one's got me quite like you

I want you all to myself
Don't leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
No angels could beckon me back
And it's hotter than hell where I'm at
I am an animal with you

An ode to the boy I love
Boy I'll die to care for you
You're mine, mine, mine, tell me who do I owe that to
And as the days fly by
We'll be more than getting through, yeah
And in time, time, time, we'll build a home for two

I want you all to myself
Don't leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
No angels could beckon me back
It's hotter than hell where I'm at
I am an animal with you

All is right in the meadow
When I'm lying next to my fellow
Baby that's you
Baby that's you
One way trip like an arrow
All laid out like a tarot
Baby that's you
Baby that's you

I want you all to myself
Don't leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
No angels could beckon me back
And it's hotter than hell where I'm at
I am an animal with you
...

"This This"

Babe, you know I regret those words
Bombs that you did not deserve
Well alright, alright
And hey, usually just takes a day
Before we're on a brand new page
Alright, well that's fine

We turn in our apologies for peace of mind
Taking in this moment where it's all alright, it's alright

So how do we keep this this
How do we keep this bliss
How do we
How do we stay this close
I don't want to let go (how do we)
So how do we keep this this

Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this

Ties can tangle up and become knots
Gotta work so that we don't get caught
Alright, alright
And I will take myself to the front line
Don't care if it's talking all night
It's alright, it's alright

We turn in our apologies for peace of mind
Taking in this moment where it's all alright, it's all alright

So how do we keep this this
How do we keep this bliss

"Running Shoes"

I'll keep wearing these running shoes 'til I'm all worn out
And they're no use to me
No use to me
Gunning for a peace from this abuse
'Cause I'm all tired out and I'm no use to you
No use to you

And there's no rest for the wicked
So I'm screaming and I'm kicking to sleep
To sleep
The beliefs they're instilling
On the boys, on the children
On me, on me

I've been running, I've been running for a while
For a while
I've been running, I've been running for a while
For a while

These running shoes weigh me down
These running shoes are wearing out
This running

Carved his name in the carpet
Right where I spent all of my sleepless nights in that room
In that room
Can't get his face out of my mind
And God knows that I've tried and tried for you

And there's no rest for the wicked
So I'm screaming and I'm kicking to sleep
To sleep
The beliefs they're instilling
On the boys, on the children
On me, on me

I've been running, I've been running for a while
(Running, running)
For a while
(Running, running)
I've been running, I've been running for a while
(Running, running)
For a while
(Running, running)

These running shoes weigh me down
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
(Running, running)
(Running, running)
These running shoes weigh me down
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
(Running, running)
(Running, running)

Love in America got me down
Try to take off running but hit the ground

These running shoes weigh me down
(I've been running, I've been running for a while)
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
These running shoes weigh me down
(I've been running, I've been running for a while)
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
These running shoes weigh me down

"Seventeen (Reprise)"

I got these beliefs that I think you wanna break
Got something here to lose that I think you wanna take from me
You say that I'm asleep but I wanna be awake
Got something here to lose that I know you wanna take

And he said age is just a number, just like any other
We can do whatever, do whatever you want
Boy becomes a man now
Can't tell a man to slow down
He'll just do whatever, do whatever he wants

Here he comes
Like he just walked out of a dream
Doesn't care you're seventeen
Or maybe he forgot what that means
But yeah, he comes
He comes

"Take Yourself Home"

I'm tired of the city
Scream if you're with me
If I'm gonna die
Let's die somewhere pretty (Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Sad in the summer
City needs a mother
If I'm gonna waste my time
Then it's time to go
Take yourself home

Talk to me
There's nothing that can't be fixed with some honesty
And how it got this dark is just beyond to me
If anyone can hear me switch the lights (Lights, lights, lights)
Oh-oh-oh-oh

And happiness
Is right there where you lost it
When you took the bet
Counting all the losses that you can't collect
Got everything and nothing in my life

I'm tired of the city
Scream if you're with me
If I'm gonna die
Let's die somewhere pretty (Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Sad in the summer
City needs a mother
If I'm gonna waste my time then it's time to go
Take yourself home
Take yourself home

Who you really tryna be when they see your face
Is it worth it trying to win in a losing game
Well it's all waiting for you
And, boy, I know you're eager
But it just might destroy you
Destroy you, yeah

I'm tired of the city
Scream if you're with me
If I'm gonna die
Let's die somewhere pretty (Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Sad in the summer
City needs a mother
If I'm gonna waste my time then it's time to go
Take yourself home
Take yourself home
Take yourself home

"Easy"

You ran away to find something to say
I went astray to make it okay, and he made it easy, darlin'
I'm still in love and I say that because
I know how it seems between you and me, it hasn't been easy, darlin'

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo
Burning the tears right off my face
What the hell did we do
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy
Easy
Please don't leave me
Leave me

What's left of the dance That's all on my hands
The rock in my throat, a hair on my coat
The stranger at home, my darlin'
(Like some kind of freak, my darlin')
Now I'm vulnerable, so sad and alone
But don't cry for me, 'cause everyone knows
You reap what you sow, my darlin'
Uh-yeah, yeah, yeah

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo
Burning the tears right off my face
What the hell did we do
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy
Easy
Please don't leave me
Don't leave me

(He made it easy)
(Please don't leave me)
(He made it easy)
(Please don't leave me)

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo
Burning the tears right off my face
What the hell did we do
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy
Easy
Please don't leave me, no
Don't leave me

"could cry just thinkin about you"

Now I'm knee-deep in this mess
I could cry just thinking about you
Every line I write is something about you
Every guy I want looks something just like you
Every book I read I only read for you
Every art piece is just to remind you
I don't know who I am with, or without you
But I guess I'm bout to find out
I, I, I

"STUD"

Hey, stud, you can come
And you can come and meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love

Hey, tough, what's it like to be so big and strong and so buff
Everything I'm not, but could I still be a hunk to you
Enough for you
A stud to you

Takin' the fun out of fucks
Searchin' for something I'm not
Knowin' that you're not the one
(But you're the one for right now, yeah)

How much of me would you take
And how much of me would you change
On second thought, don't say a thing
('Cause you're the one for right now)

Just let me believe that you like what you seein'
When you're lookin' at me and your heartbeat is speedin'
At seven hundred miles down highways to Eden
Like my body's the apple you're eatin'

Hey, stud, you can come
And you can come and meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love

Hey, stud, you can come
And you can come and meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love

We're into this (Right)
We should do this (Right)
You could make my (Night)
We should do this (Right)
We're into this (Right)
We should do this (Right)
You could make my (Night)

"1010"

Now we're adversaries in a pretty house, yeah
Couldn't tell you what we're even fight 'bout, yeah
That's probably something we should figure out, yeah
Ooh

Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be
But let's be what we are (Let's be what we are)

Infatuation fading in and out, yeah
Gotta find a piece that keeps us sticking 'round, yeah

We're alright, 'cause

I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be
But let's be what we are (Let's be what we are)

There will be dark days, ooh
Swear that they'll be short
There will be good days, ooh
There'll be so many more
You can always be sure that

I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be
But let's be what we are (Let's be what we are)

"IN A DREAM"

I think about it
Can't think about it
Took a flight all the way home, yeah, ooh
No way around it
I still see you way up here, yeah

I'm stressed about it
Went West about it
Took a hammer to my phone, yeah, ooh
The way you run it
I still hear you crystal clear

But I won't let you in again
I'm gonna lock the doors and hide my shit
'Cause my spirit's wearing thin
And there's only so much I can give
I won't let you in again
That's the hardest thing I've ever said
You know, that's the hardest thing I've said

Guess I might understand it
If you don't listen to me
But I thought it was obvious
That you don't show up in a dream
Guess I even forgive you
For you not wanting to leave, no, no, no
Put my shoes on and run away
You still show up in a dream
Only making this harder
'Cause I still have to see your, see your face, yeah

Can you come back
Wait, I don't mean that, no
It's all just feeling real now, ooh
So far away, but I still feel you everywhere

But I can't let you in again

"What's The Time Where You Are"

God, I wish it was you

Tokyo just hit me like a wave
Where we ended up, I couldn't say
I'm feelin' like my head's just in a distant time and place
I hope that I got you
The way that you got me, baby

And I spent so long just waiting for the signs
Thought I'd lost my every feeling on the ride
Then oh, you showed, and that's just the way love goes
Now the only thing I wanna know

Is what's the time where you are, you are
What's the night like where you are, you are
International straight shot to my heart
I'm right on top of this groove
(Groove)
But God, I wish it was you
(You)

Is it better where you are, you are
What's the weather where you are, you are
International through line to my heart
This beat is making me move
(Move)
But God, I wish it was you
(You)
God, I wish it was you

Open invite if you wanna come
(If you wanna come)
'Cause I'm everywhere, you'd think I'm on the run
I'm okay with waiting if, when all is said and all is done
(Is said and done)
You know that I got you
The way that you got me, baby

And I spent so long just waiting for the signs
Thought I'd lost my every feeling on the ride
Then oh, you showed, that's just the way love goes
Now the only thing I wanna know

Is what's the time where you are, you are
What's the night like where you are, you are
International straight shot to my heart
I'm right on top of this groove
Groove

"One Of Your Girls"

Everybody loves you, baby
You should trademark your face
Lining down the block to be around you
But baby, I'm first in place

Face card, no cash, no credit
Yes, God, don't speak, you said it
Look at you
Skip the application, interview
Sweet like Marabou
Look, look at you

Give me a call if you ever get lonely
I'll be like one of your girls or your homies
Say what you want, and I'll keep it a secret
You get the key to my heart, and I need it
Give me a call if you ever get desperate
I'll be like one of your girls

Everybody wants you, baby
Everybody
You should insure that waist
With the highest policy you can get
But nobody wants you bad as I do
Baby, let me plead my case

Face card, no cash, no credit
Yes, God, don't speak, you said it
Look at you
Pop the culture, iconography
Is standing right in front of me
Look, look at you

Give me a call if you ever get lonely
I'll be like one of your girls or your homies
Say what you want, and I'll keep it a secret
You get the key to my heart, and I need it
Give me a call if you ever get desperate
I'll be like one of your girls

Give me a call if you ever get desperate
I'll be like one of your girls

"In My Room"
(feat. Guitarricadelafuente)

Confundo la realidad
Y es que todo me extasa
Se ha encendido el cielo
Se te enreda el pelo
Tus espuelas con las mas

So in my head
And I leave it like an unmade bed
Oh, I don't wanna clean up yet
Keep it messy, messy, messy, aww-yeah

Se ha encendido el cielo
Se te enreda el pelo
Tus espuelas con las mas

Am I fucking sixteen
This shit's kinda depressing
All you're doing to me
'Cause you mess me, test me, wreck me, aww-yeah
Maybe it's just admiration, copulation, or
Adoration, no defence, infatuation, aww-yeah

I'm all alone in my room
I'm just thinking 'bout you
It's a feeling I can't describe
Maybe it's just admiration, copulation, or
Adoration, no defence, infatuation, aww-yeah

Confundo la realidad
Y es que todo me extasa
Se ha encendido el cielo
Se te enreda el pelo
Tus espuelas con las mas

So in my head
And I leave it like an unmade bed
Oh, I don't wanna clean up yet
Keep it messy, messy, messy, aww-yeah

Se ha encendido el cielo
Se te enreda el pelo
Tus espuelas con las mas

Y aunque est partida
Tu mirada es genuina
S que ests pensando
Carnavaleando

Has dado en el blanco
Dientes en el canto
Que la carne fra
Es fina peletera

I'm all alone in my room
I'm just thinking 'bout you
It's a feeling I can't describe
Maybe it's just admiration, copulation, or
Adoration, no defence, infatuation, aww-yeah

We got something to give each other

"Still Got It"

Cut my hair into a bowl
After you told me that you liked it like that
Wish I didn't care at all
But now I'm in the mirror with scissors in hand

I saw you at a party, said hello like an old colleague
Talked about the summer when we didn't know each other

Was bound to happen, I suppose
But fuck me, now I really know
Yeah, I know

I still got it bad
I still got it bad
'Cause you've got what you had
And I still want it, I still want it, and I still want it bad

Getting used to being alone
But babe, a house don't mean a home like before, no
Got a place back in Australia
It's different than you remember
I think you'd like it though

You touched me in the back seat
Of the party bus on 10th Street
Kinda confused me
Both a couple drinks in too deep, it

Was bound to happen, I suppose
But fuck me, now I really know
Yeah, I know

I still got it bad
I still got it bad
'Cause you've got what you had
And I still want it, I still want it, and I still want it bad

We lost what we had
And now I want it, now I want it, now I want it back
'Cause you still got it

"Can't Go Back, Baby"

Can't go back, baby
Can't go back, baby
I wish I could, but I can't go
Can't go back, baby
To the days when I thought I knew ya

This is me you're talking about
Your only friend
Put your love into the ground
On my big weekend
While I was singing songs about you
On the TV screen
Don't know how he left the hotel
I wasn't there to see

In the morning
Your hands around my waist
Just us two
In the evening
On my mouth, could you still taste him

Can't go back, baby
I wish I could, but I can't go
Can't go back, baby
To the days when I thought I knew ya
Can't go back, baby
You wish you could, but you can't go
Can't go back, baby

I wish you weren't dead to me
So much to miss in you
More than just my enemy
You were my lover, too

And I hope you forgive yourself
Because I swear I do
And it breaks my heart to say
I can't wait to live without you

In the morning, yeah, I wake up
With the sun across my face
In the evening, yeah, I lay with
So much love to take your place, and now I

Can't go back, baby
I wish I could, but I can't go
Can't go back, baby
To the days when I thought I knew ya
Can't go back, baby
You wish you could, but you can't go
Can't go back, baby

"Got Me Started"

He's got the personality, not even gravity could ever hold him down
He's got the sexuality of a man who can take a room and drown it out
Yeah

Inchin' closer to sunrise
Now we're standin' eye to eye
I wanna tell you what's on my
On my mind (Let's go)

Come back and feel the vibe

We've got that hot chemistry, yeah, you and me won't make it out this house
We should experiment even to the detriment of whoever's on the couch (Oh, yeah)

Inchin' closer to sunrise
Now we're layin' side by side

"Silly"

I'm still in it like that
Baby, I'm a love junkie like that
I'm so silly like that
Can you hit me back
'Cause you really know me
But, you don't wanna know me

All the bodies on the floor collide
Everybody's out here looking right
The party's the only place that really knows me
I'm just tryna get outside of this body

I still love you more than I should say
I'm just tryna put that ... away
Don't need anybody here to console me
I'm just tryna get outside of this

Boy, can you hit me back
'Cause you really know me
Yeah, but you don't wanna know me

Alterate my mind to be like you
There's only so much a party can work out, a party could do
I don't need anybody here to console me
I'm just tryna get outside of this

I'm just recreating you
I'm working with what I got
Fill up my cup and shoot
Yeah, I just
Gotta rewire my desire, getting me higher
And higher

"Honey"

Give me the courage to say all the shit I mean
Give me a song to rock your body, a lucid dream
I don't know how I'm gonna tell you what you really mean
Give me that honey, honey, love you've got the recipe

Y'know
I see love in every space
I see sex in every city, every town
I wonder what us two could make
'Coz I feel so good around you
Can you imagine what we'd get up to

There's something different about tonight
I could speak, or just let my body explain
I'm getting close to satisfied
And I've learned so much about you
Don't know your name, that's something we'll get to, yeah

Overdrive
My body's working in overdrive
Don't care how late, let's go overtime

"How To Stay With You"

Cut my garden down
I've got no flowers, but it's the thought that counts
Wish you lived a little closer
Maybe when we're a little older
We can set up shop
Back where you are or I can take you home
I feel like my brother might like you
Just not in the same way I do, yeah

Boy, I wish you were the piece
To get me out the game
If I have to say what I mean
Is it fair to say
All of these visions
Impair my decisions
And I can't stop

I'm a little bit fucked on this
I'm a little bit out of time to spend with you
Baby, turn around, give me one more kiss
I'm a little bit lost on how to stay with you

I turn my ... out
It's been a sec, but I didn't forget
How to pull you in closer
In case it's not till we're older
That we reach the top
The pinnacle of everything we are
I feel like my mother might like you
Just not in the same way I do

Boy, I wish you were the piece
To get me out the game
If I have to say what I mean
Is it fair to say
All of these visions
Impair my decisions
And I can't stop

I'm a little bit fucked on this
I'm a little bit out of time to spend with you
Baby, turn around, give me one more kiss
I'm a little bit lost on how to stay with you

Starting again when I got all I wanted
Starting to feel a little bit despondent, yeah
Starting again when I got all I wanted
Starting to feel a little bit despondent

"Angel Baby"

I need a lover to keep me sane
Pull me from hell bring me back again
Play me the classics
Something romantic
Give him my all when I don't even have it
I always dreamed of a solemn face
Someone who feels like a holiday
But now I'm in pieces, barely believing
Starting to think that I've lost all feeling

You came out the blue on a rainy night, no lie
I tell you how I almost died, while you're bringing me back to life

I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
Started giving up on the word forever
Until you give up heaven so we could be together

You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel, baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby

I'll fall in love with the little things
Counting the tattoos on your skin
Tell me a secret
And baby I'll keep it
And maybe we can play house for the weekend

You came out the blue on a rainy night, no lie
I'll tell you how I almost died
While you're bringing me back to life

I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
Started giving up on the word forever
Until you give up heaven so we could be together

You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel, baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby

All the sick and twisted nights that I've been waiting for ya
They were worth it all along, yeah

I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
Started giving up on the word forever (Ooh, forever)
Until you give up heaven so we could be together

You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel, baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby
Angel, angel baby (You're my angel, baby)
Angel, you're my angel, baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby

"Blue Moon"

In my free, in my wild.
In my dark, oh we started.
Started to doubt, doubt this fire.
Lighting up our lives, and it kept me up at night.
Crash and burn is all I know,
I think that's why I made you go.
Those three words, you were my first,
I can't help thinking...

Maybe you were my blue moon,
maybe I let go too soon.
Running from what could be,
so terrified of happy,
how did I come to lose...
My blue moon
My blue moon

Which one of us, went and fucked up
You and me... I guess it was me.
Don't know a good thing when
it's right in front of me cause I'm so numb.
What have I become
Oh, cause crash and burn is all I know.
I think that's why I made you go.
Those three words, you were my first,
I can't help thinking...

Maybe you were my blue moon,
maybe I let go too soon.
Running from what could be,
so terrified of happy,
how did I come to lose...
My blue moon
My blue moon

Crash and burn is all I know,
I think that's why I made you go.
Those three words, you were my first,
I can't help thinking...

Maybe you were my blue moon,
maybe I let go too soon.
Running from what could be,
so terrified of happy,
how did I come to lose my blue...

Maybe you were my blue moon,
maybe I let go too soon.
Running from what could be, 
so terrified of happy,
how did I come to lose,
My blue moon

"could cry just thinkin about you (Full Version)"

We wrote a life all by ourselves
Wish I could put it back on the shelf
But there's a dazzling wave that keeps me at bay with you, my love
I ride this one all by myself

I could cry just thinking about you
Every line I write is something about you
Every guy I want looks something just like you
Every book I read I only read for you
Every art piece is just to remind you
I don't know who I am with or without you
But I guess I'm 'bout to find out
Yeah, I guess I'm 'bout to find out

We took a trip and made the best
We laughed and played, then laid to rest
But life's a blackening way of drifting us further than we are, oh yeah
And now we're knee-deep in this mess

I could cry just thinking about you
Every line I write is something about you
Every guy I want looks something just like you
Every book I read I only read for you
Every art piece is just to remind you
I don't know who I am with or without you
But I guess I'm 'bout to find out

"Easy (Remix)"
(feat. Mark Ronson)

Woo

You ran away to find something to say
I went astray to make it okay
And he made it easy, darlin'
I'm still in love and I say that because
I know how it seems between you and me
It hasn't been easy darlin'

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo
Burnin' the tears right out my face
What the hell did we do
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please don't leave me, leave me

I'm not a saint so just give me the blame
I know what I want and it gets in my way
I know I'm not easy, darlin'
(I'm kinda a freak, my darlin')
When you see me out
I hope the taste in your mouth
Is still as sweet as I wish it could be
Believe me, darlin'
Ay, yeah, yeah, yeah

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo
Burnin' the tears right out my face
What the hell did we do
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please don't leave me, don't leave me

We knew what was under the surface
And lived like it wouldn't hurt us
But it hurt us

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo
Burnin' the tears right out my face
What the hell did we do
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please don't leave me, no
Don't leave me

He made it easy
Please don't leave me
He made it easy
Please don't leave me

"For Them"

Yesterday I heard the news
That 4 million Russian children are homeless
They've been abandoned by the people they trust
Now their cold and lonely lives are hopeless

Children of the world are dying
People say they care, they're lying
If this life was theirs, they'd be crying
Is it really fair we're not trying

Yesterday I read the news
That 20 million Asian children are homeless
They've been abandoned by the people they love
They've been beaten down so hard they can't get up

Children of the world are dying
People say they care, they're lying
If this life was theirs, they'd be crying
Is it really fair

Children of the world
People say they care, well they're lying
If this life was theirs, they'd be crying
Is it really fair we're not trying

Life is beautiful for some
Life is beautiful for us
Life isn't beautiful for them
Maybe life can be beautiful again for them

"Happy Little Pill (Casper azz Remix)"

In the crowd alone
And every second passing reminds me I'm not whole
Bright lights and city sounds are ringing like a drone
Unknown, unknown

Oh, glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills
And
My happy little pill

Like a rock I float
Sweat and conversations seep into my bones
Four walls are not enough
I'll take a dip into the
Unknown, unknown

Oh, glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills
And

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring color to my skies
My sweet little pill
Tame my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin

"Lonely People"
(from "Trolls Band Together" soundtrack)

This is for all the lonely people
Thinkin' that life has passed us by
We won't give up until we drink from the silver cup
And ride that highway to the sky

"My Babe"

My babe
Don't stand no cheating
My babe

Oh yeah
She don't stand no cheating
My babe

Oh yeah,
She don't stand no cheating

She don't take none of that
Midnight creepin'
My babe

True little honey
My babe

My babe
I know she love me
My babe

Oh yes
I know she love me
My babe

Oh yes
I know she love me

Don't do nothin but
Kiss and hug me
My babe

True little baby
My babe

"My My My (Cash Cash Remix)"

Shine on, diamond
Don't make me wait another day
'Cause passion is passion
You know it just as well as me

Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my

Spark up, buzz cut
I got my tongue between your teeth
Go slow, no, no, go fast
You like it just as much as me

Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my

Oh my, my, my
(Oh my, my)
I die every night with you
(I die, I die, I die, I die, yeah, yeah)
Oh my, my, my
(Oh my, my, my
Oh my, my, my)
Living for your every move
(Living for, living for, yeah)
Oh my, my, my

"Revelation"
(from "Boy Erased" soundtrack)

You're a revelation
Won't you liberate me now
From a holy bound
You're a revolution
I will liberate you now
As the walls come down

It's a rocky road to say
Maybe I won't go
Hey dear, you're a wrecking ball
You're here crushing all I'm told

Ever I roam
Ever I roam
Further from home
Your hand I know

It's a revelation
There's no hell in what I found
No kingdom shell
How the tides are changing
As you liberate me now
And the walls come down

'Til the end
It's a rocky road to say
Maybe I won't go
Hey dear, you're a wrecking ball
You're here crushing all I'm told

Ever I roam
Ever I roam
Further from home
Your hand I know
Ever I roam
Ever I roam
Ever I roam

"Rush (Remix)"
(feat. PinkPantheress, Hyunjin of Stray Kids)

I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Yeah

Big communication, tell me what you want
Translate your vibration, let your body talk to me
Baby love, if you wanna show me what
You've been schemin' up, if you wanna (Let go)
Trust the simulation, don't you let it break
Every stimulation, promise I can take
What you wanna give Boy, you better show me what
You've been schemin' up

You got my heartbeat racin'
My body blazin'

I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good

So good when we slow gravity, so good
It's so good, it's so good
Breathe one, two, three, take all of me, so good
It's so good, it's so good

I'm not your somebody interested in dancin'
I just told my lover, "Baby, tell me" (Yeah)
"Did you really care" I'm two stepped with another
But you're still my sunshine, take this with me
And I finished it so I know I'm sure
Haven't done this since September
Right around then you were at my door
I can barely still remember
How did we end up on the floor
Can we go some more
Somehow I think we're better off just dancin'

You got my heartbeat (Heartbeat) racin' (Racin')
My body blazin'

I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good

So good when we slow gravity, so good
It's so good, it's so good (Good)
Breathe one, two, three, take all of me, so good
It's so good, it's so good

It's so good, it's so good
Yeah
It's so good, it's so good

"Strawberries & Cigarettes"
(from "Love, Simon" soundtrack)

Remember when we first met
You said "light my cigarette"
So I lied to my mom and dad
I jumped the fence and I ran
But we couldn't go very far
'Cause you locked your keys in your car
So you sat and stared at my lips
And I could already feel your kiss

Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights, on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

Remember when you taught me fate
Said it'd all be worth the wait
Like that night in the back of the cab
When your fingers walked in my hand
Next day, nothing on my phone
But I can still smell you on my clothes
Always hoping that things would change
But we went right back to your games

Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights, on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

And even if I run away
And give my heart a holiday
Still strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
You always leave me wanting more
I can't shake my hunger for
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Yeah, they always taste like you
You
Long nights, daydreams
With that sugar and smoke rings
Always taste like you

Headlights, on me (And even if I run away)
Racing to 60, I've been a fool (And give my heart a holiday)
Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans (You always leave me wanting more)
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool (I can't shake my hunger for)
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

"The 2012 Song"

One Direction took over the world,
All the boys and Harry's curly curls.
And Obama's back, I guess he's a hit,
Thank you, US, cause Mitt Romney's a shit.
Gangnam Style took over the tubes,
The London olympics were pretty huge.
Drake told people You Only Live Once,
Hashtag YOLO son.
Carly Jepsen said call me maybe,
And Justin said, that's not my

In 2012, ooh in 2012.
In 2012, ohh 2012.

Kony please stop acting like a prick,
The producer of that played with his
Cole Sprouse joined tumblr, we said hello,
But now he's just somebody that we used to know.
Somebody, somebody.
That dude Felix, jumped from the sky,
Everyone thought, he's gonna die.
Swag, swag, swag on you.
Personally, I started vlogging too

In 2012, ooh in 2012.
In 2012, ohh 2012.

The world ended, we all got owned,
Oh wait shit sorry, that was postponed.

In 2012, ooh in 2012.
In 2012, ohh 2012.

In 2012, ooh in 2012.
In 2012, ohh 2012.

"The 2013 Song"

Oh and I don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I think I just shed a tear
2-0-1-3, it's been a kick-ass year

Miley went on twerked on stage
Made the whole world fill with rage
But she sold records, like she was taught
And then came around little old Lorde

Speaking of royals, they had a baby
And then came out Mr. Tom Daley
The world's realising it's not a choice
I'm still Troye, I just happen to like boys

What I like boys. Have you seen their butts Exactly

Robin Thicke went to number 1
Even though his song was sexist and dumb
Yeah that's right, I'm talking Blurred Lines
But oh shit wait, let's talk about Amanda Bynes

Everybody said that she went a bit koo-koo
Telling Drake he should murder her hoo-hoo
We say she's the one who's going cray
But here we are asking What The Fox Say

Oh and I don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I think I just shed a tear
2-0-1-3, it's been a kick-ass year

The US Government needed a break
Probably to go do the Harlem Shake
Catching Fire was good, dudes
Got me as excited as the Dylan Sprouse nudes

The 1D boys said This Is Us
Beyonce dropped an album without a fuss
Rest in peace, Nelson Mandela
To you, Madiba, we're indebted forever

Oh and I don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I think I just shed a tear
2-0-1-3, it's been a kick-ass year

Now do the Harlem Shake

Oh and I don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I think I just shed a tear
2-0-1-3, it's been a kick-ass year

"The Fault In Our Stars"

The weight
Of a simple human emotion
Weighs me down
More than the tank ever did

The pain
It's determined and demanding
To ache, but I'm OK

And I don't wanna let this go
I don't wanna lose control
I just wanna see the stars with you

And I don't wanna say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just wanna see the stars with you

You lost
A part of your existence
In the war against yourself

Oh, the lights,
They light up in lights of sadness
Telling you, it's time to go

And I don't wanna let this go
I don't wanna lose control
I just wanna see the stars with you

And I don't wanna say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just wanna see the stars with you

[3x]
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand for one more minute,
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand

And I don't wanna let this go
I don't wanna lose control
I just wanna see the stars with you

And I don't wanna say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just wanna see the stars with you

With you

"Trouble"

Accidental lover, what you do with all my common sense
You came in undercover when I didn't even want a friend

I'm tired of living like I'm dying
But now I can find the silver lining like before
Yeah, like before
You got a funny sense of timing
Showed up on the night that I stopped trying for something more
For something more

And I'm like, "Oh sweet God, I think I'm in trouble"
Kinda making me wonder what it's like on the other side
And I'm like, "Baby, you're kinda driving me crazy"
I'm not one to need saving, but I guess I'll give it a try

Oh my, oh my

Tandem lover, what I tell you is in confidence
Laying here together makes me wanna take a second chance

My room is spinning when I'm sober
So somebody wake me in October
Oh my God
You got a funny sense of knowing
I don't know where all this is going
But don't stop

And I'm like, "Oh sweet God, I think I'm in trouble"
Kinda making me wonder what it's like on the other side
And I'm like, "Baby, you're kinda driving me crazy"
I'm not one to need saving, but I guess I'll give it a try

Oh my, oh my

You've got me going under
Can't help but wonder if you'd be there by my side
Or should I just move along all by myself

You've got me going under
Can't help but wonder if you'd be there by my side
Or should I, I, I

But I'm like, "Oh shit, God, I think we're in trouble"
Kinda making me wonder what it's like on the other side
And oh baby, you're kinda driving me crazy
I'm not one to need saving, but I guess I'll give it a try

Oh my, oh my

"Wait"
(from "Three Months" soundtrack)

Could've broken me like glass in an emergency
It's a giving in, where do I begin
Pastel skies, I don't know why
I hate Florida sometimes
Is it take and take
Or is it my mistake

What I used to know, I don't know
Keeps spinning me out, I lose control
When it feels like I am on my own
Don't try to save me

One thing I am sure of is everything will change
Time moves fast, you grow old
Days we can't rearrange
Changing tides, I feel it in my bones
And I don't ask why and I just let them go 'cause I know
One thing I am sure of
For you, I'll wait

In the sand you dig your heels, on who I am and what is real
Only you and me, and all we're going to be

What I used to know, I don't know
Keeps spinning me out, I lose control
When it feels like I am on my own
Don't try to save me

One thing I am sure of is everything will change
Time moves fast, you grow old
Days we can't rearrange
Changing tides, I feel it in my bones
And I don't ask why and I just let them go 'cause I know
One thing I am sure of
For you, I'll wait

"We're My OTP"

Valentine's Day is creeping up on me
Still staring at you on my computer screen
Writing a fan fic in the middle of the night
'Cause this will bring us closer, right

"You've never met them," the peasant cried
Shut the fuck up bitch Do you wanna die
And I've told you before, are you deaf
I've fallen in love with a GIF

OTP,
We're my OTP,
Baby you and me
We'd be so sexy

OTP,
We're my OTP,
Baby you and me
We'd be so sexy

Bieber fever, One Direction infection
Whatever floats your boat, what's your addiction
And you, Tumblr, you make it so much worse
You make me feel the feels right where it hurts

I'll love you always, I'll love you 5ever
I'll love you as much as I love Nutella... almost.

OTP,
We're my OTP,
Baby you and me
We'd be so sexy

OTP,
We're my OTP,
Baby you and me
We'd be so sexy

OTP,
We're my OTP,
Baby you and me
We'd be so sexy, oh

OTP,
We're my OTP,
(We're my OTP baby)
Baby you and me
(OTP, OTP)
We'd be so sexy, oh

[Spoken]
No, literally, the only thing that's stopping us from getting married is the fact that we haven't "met yet".

"WILD (Remix)"
(feat. Alessia Cara)

Trying hard not to fall
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down, down
Kissing up on fences
And up on walls
On the way home
I guess it's all working out, now

'Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh

Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild

'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild

You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild

Were alike you and I
Two blue hearts locked in our wrong minds
So can we make the most out of no time
Can you hold me
Can you make me leave my demons & my broken pieces behind

'Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild

'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild

You're driving me wild, wild, wild

You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild

You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild

Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild

'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild 

You're driving me wild, wild, wild

"Bite The Hand"

I can't hear you, you're too far away
I can't see you, the light is in my face
I can't touch you, I wouldn't if I could

I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to

Here's the best part, distilled for you
But you want what I can't give to you
Your hands are grabbing while my hands are tied

I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to

Who do you think you are
Who do you think I am
What do you want to say
What do you think will change
Maybe I'm afraid of you
Maybe I'm afraid of you

I'll bite the hand that feeds me
Bite the hand that feeds me
Bite the hand
Bite the hand
Bite the hand that needs me
Bite the hand that needs me
Bite the hand
Bite the hand

I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to

I can't love you how you want me to

"Me & My Dog"

We had a great day
Even though we forgot to eat
And you had a bad dream
And we got no sleep
'Cause we were kissing

I had a fever
Until I met you
Now you make me cool
But sometimes I still do
Something embarrassing

I never said I'd be all right
Just thought I could hold myself together
When I couldn't breathe, I went outside
Don't know why I thought it'd be any better
I'm fine now, it doesn't matter

I didn't wanna be this guy
I cried at your show with the teenagers
Tell your friend I'll be all right
In the morning it won't matter

I wanna be emaciated
I wanna hear one song without thinking of you
I wish I was on a spaceship
Just me and my dog and an impossible view

I dream about it
And I wake up falling

"Souvenir"

[Julien Baker]
Dreamcatcher on the rearview mirror
Hasn't caught a thing yet
Twenty dollars and a souvenir
Anything's worth trying

To stay out of your nightmares
Say I was in your dream last night
Always end up dying
You said, because of course I did
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh

[Phoebe Bridgers]
Always managed to move in
Right next to cemeteries
And never far from a hospital
I don't know what that tells you about me

[Lucy Dacus]
Pulling thorns out of my palm
Work a midnight surgery
When you cut a hole into my skull
Do you hate what you see
Like I do
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh

"Stay Down"

Wasn't a fighter until somebody told me
I had better learn to lean into the punch
So it don't hurt as bad when they leave
There you were, turning your cheek

I look at you and you look at a screen
I'm in the back seat of my body
I'm just steering my life in a video game
Similar acts and a different name

It's a slow down

So would you teach me I'm the villain, aren't I
Aren't I the one constantly repenting for a difficult mind
Push me down into the water like a sinner, hold me under
And I'll never come up again

I'll just stay down

It's a half life, it's a fallout
It takes so long for me to settle down
And when I finally do, there's no one else around

So I stay down
So I stay down
So I stay down
So I stay down
So I stay down

"Salt In The Wound"

You put salt in the wound
And a kiss on my cheek
You butter me up
And you sit down to eat
You add insult to injury
You say you believe in me
But you haven't decided
About taking or leaving me

But you take and you take
Like silks up my sleeve
Tied corner to corner, never ending
Trick after trick, I make the magic
And you unrelentingly ask for the secret

Neck full of mockingbirds
All calling your name
I tried to sing it all back
Like I heard it, it don't sound the same
I'm gnashing my teeth
Like a child of Cain
If this is a prison, I'm willing to buy my own chain

But you take and you take
Like silks up my sleeve
Tied corner to corner, never ending
Trick after trick, I make the magic
And you unrelentingly ask for the secret

They say the hearts and minds are on your side
They say the finish line is in your sights
What they don't say is what's on the other side
They say the hearts and minds are on your side

"Ketchum, ID"

'Kay

Back in the States now
In a college town
I would walk around
But it's really coming down
Mesmerized by double lines
Two yellow tightropes
I'm making good time

I am never anywhere
Anywhere I go
When I'm home, I'm never there
Long enough to know

Being in love
Is the same thing as being alone
Giving the sorrow some company
Nothing to say
But stay on the phone
No, I'm sorry I do not know
What else you want from me

I am never anywhere
Anywhere I go
When I'm home, I'm never there
Long enough to know

You say, "How are you"
I say, "I don't know
Let's dissolve the band
Move to Idaho"
Everyone's around
And I hear you smiling
You say, "I love you"
I say, "You too"

I am never anywhere
Anywhere I go
When I'm home, I'm never there
Long enough to know
Ooh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh
I am never anywhere
Anywhere I go
When I'm home, I'm never there
Long enough

"Without You Without Them"

Give me everything you've got
I'll take what I can get
I want to hear your story and be a part of it

Thank your father before you
His mother before him
Who would I be without you, without them

Speak to me, speak to me, speak to me
Until your history's no mystery to me

Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
Until the words run dry
We'll see eye to eye

I'll give everything I've got
Please take what I can give
I want you to hear my story and be a part of it

Thank my father before me
His mother before him
Who would I be without you, without them

"$20"

It's a bad idea and I'm all about it
Give it one more chance and
Then I finally had it
When you wake up, I'll be gone again
Motorcycle in the front lawn

It's an all-night drive from your house to Reno
To the T-bird graveyard where we play with fire
In another life, we were arsonists
How long's the Chevy been on cinder blocks

Mama told me that it don't run
On wishes but that I should have fun
Pushing the flowers that come up
Into the front of a shotgun
So many hills to die on

Run out of gas, out of time, out of money
You're doing what you can, just makin' it run
(Take a break, make your escape)
Gas, out of time, out of money
You're doing what you can, just makin' it run
(There's only so much I can
Take a break, make your escape)
May I please have twenty dollars
Gas, out of time, out of money
You're doing what you can, just makin' it run
(There's only so much I can
Take a break, make your escape)
Can you give me twenty dollars
(Gas, out of time, out of money
You're doing what you can, just makin' it run)
(There's only so much I can
Take a break, make your escape)
(Gas, out of time, out of money
You're doing what you can, just makin' it run)
(There's only so much I can
Take a break, make your escape)
I know you have twenty dollars
I know you have twenty dollars

"Emily I'm Sorry"

She's asleep in the backseat
Looking peaceful enough to me
But she's wakin' up inside a dream
Full of screeching tires and fire
We're comin' back from where no one lives
Pretty much just veterans
When I pointed out where the North Star is
She called me a fuckin' liar

Emily (Emily), I'm sorry, I just
Make it up as I go along
Yet, I can feel myself becoming (I can feel)
Someone only you could want

Headed straight for the concrete
In a nightmare screaming
Now I'm wide awake, spiraling
And you don't wanna talk
Just take me back to Montral
I'll get a real job, you'll go back to school
We can burn out in the freezing cold
And just get lost

Emily (Emily), I'm sorry, baby
You know how I get when I'm wrong (You know how I get)
And I can feel myself becoming (I can feel)
Somebody I'm not, I'm not, so
Emily (Emily), forgive me, can we
Make it up as we go along
I'm twenty-seven and I don't know who I am (Don't know who I am)
But I know what I want

Emily, I'm sorry
Emily, I'm sorry
I'm sorry

"True Blue"

You said you wanted to feel alive
So we went to the beach
You were born in July, '95
In a deadly heat
You say you're a winter bitch
But summer's in your blood
You can't help but become the sun

When you moved to Chicago
You were spinnin' out
When you don't know who you are
You fuck around and find out
When you called me from the train
Water freezin' in your eyes
You were happy and I wasn't surprised

And it feels good to be known so well
I can't hide from you like I hide from myself

Now you're movin' in
Breakin' a sweat on your upper lip
And gettin' pissed about humidity
And the leaky faucet
You already hurt my feelings three times
In the way only you could

But it feels good to be known so well
I can't hide from you like I hide from myself
I remember who I am when I'm with you
Your love is tough, your love is tried and true blue
Blue

You've never done me wrong
Except for that one time
That we don't talk about
Because it doesn't matter anymore
Who won the fight I don't know
We're not keeping score

And it feels good to be known so well
I can't hide from you like I hide from myself
I remember who I am when I'm with you
Your love is tough, your love is tried and true blue
(Blue, blue, blue)

"Cool About It"

Met you at the dive bar to go shoot some pool
And make fun of the cowboys with the neck tattoos
Ask you easy questions about work and school
I'm trying to be cool about feeling like an absolute fool about
Wishing you were kind enough to be cruel about it
Telling myself I can always do without it
Knowing that it probably isn't true

I came prepared for absolution if you'd only ask
So I take some offense when you say, "No regrets"
I remember it's impossible to pass your test
But I'm trying to forget about it
Feeling like I'm breaking a sweat about it
Wishing you would kindly get out of my head about it
Telling myself one day I'll forget about it
Knowing that it probably isn't true

Once I took your medication to know what it's like
And now I have to act like I can't read your mind
I ask you how you're doing and I let you lie
But we don't have to talk about it
I can walk you home and practice method acting
I'll pretend being with you doesn't feel like drowning
Telling you it's nice to see how good you're doing
Even though we know it isn't true

"Not Strong Enough"

Black hole opened in the kitchen
Every clock's a different time
It would only take the energy to fix it
I don't know why I am

The way I am
Not strong enough to be your man
I tried, I can't
Stop staring at the ceiling fan and
Spinning out about things that haven't happened
Breathing in and out

Drag racing through the canyon
Singing "Boys Don't Cry"
Do you see us getting scraped up off the pavement
I don't know why I am

The way I am
Not strong enough to be your man
I lied, I am
Just lowering your expectations
Half a mind that keeps the other second guessing
Close my eyes and count

Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god

Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god

Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god

I don't know why I am the way I am
There's something in the static
I think I've been having revelations
Coming to in the front seat, nearly empty
Skip the exit to our old street and go home
Go home alone

"Revolution 0"

Mm, hmm, hmm, hmm

Imaginary friend
You live up in my head
So I've been making music
Since you told me to do it

I just want to know
Who broke your nose
Figure out where they live
So I can kick their teeth in

If it isn't love, then what the fuck is it
I guess just let me pretend

I don't want to die
That's a lie
But I'm afraid to get sick
I don't know what that is

You wanted a song
So it's gonna be a short one
Wish I wasn't so tired
But I'm tired

If you're not enough
Then I give up and then nothing is

I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I

I used to think if I just closed my eyes
I would disappear

"Leonard Cohen"

On the on-ramp, you said
"If you love me, you will listen to this song."
And I could tell that you were serious so I
Didn't tell you you were driving the wrong way
On the interstate until the song was done

You felt like an idiot, adding an hour to the drive
But it gave us more time to embarrass ourselves
Telling stories we wouldn't tell anyone else
You said, "I might like you less now that you know me so well."
I might like you less now that you know me so well

Leonard Cohen once said, "There's a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in."
And I am not an old man having an existential crisis
At a Buddhist monastery writing horny poetry
But I agree
I never thought you'd happen to me
I never thought you'd happen to me

"Satanist"

Will you be a satanist with me
Mortgage off your soul to buy your dream
Vacation home in Florida
The collateral the devil's repossessing from me
Trying to score some off-brand ecstasy

Will you be an anarchist with me
Sleep in cars and kill the bourgeoisie
At least until you find out what a fake I am
Spray-paint my initials on an ATM
I'd burn the cash and smash my old TV

Will you be a nihilist with me
If nothing matters, man, that's a relief
Solomon had a point when he wrote Ecclesiastes
If nothing can be known, then stupidity is holy
If the void becomes a bore, we'll treat ourselves to some self-belief

Oh, you know what I should do

You wonder
If you can even be seen
From so far away
A slow pull, a seismic drift
Leaning over the edge of a continent
It's so hard to come back
You hang on until it drags
You under
You under
You under
You under

"We're In Love"

You could absolutely break my heart
That's how I know that we're in love
I don't need the symbol of a scar
So put down the knife
We're not swapping blood

Isn't it enough
That we stripped down to our skin
Cold and porcelain
Like bathers in a painting
And I told you of your past lives, every man you've ever been
It wasn't flattering
But you listened like it mattered

I feel crazy in ways I never say
Will you still love me if it turns out I'm insane
I know what you'll say
But it helps to hear you say it, anyway

Some October, in the future, I'll run out of trash TV
And I'll be feeling lonely
So I'll walk to karaoke
Sing the song you wrote about me, never once checking the words
I hope that no one sings along
I hope that I am not a regular

Damn, that makes me sad
It doesn't have to be like that
If you rewrite your life, may I still play a part

In the next one, will you find me
I'll be the boy with the pink carnation pinned to my lapel
Who looks like hell
And asks for help
And if you do
I'll know it's you

I can't imagine you without
The same smile in your eyes
There is something about you
That I will always recognize
And if you don't remember
I will try to remind you
Of the hummingbirds
You know the ones
And the baby scorpion
And the winter lunar halo
And the walk we took in the Redwoods
I could go on and on and on and I will
Go on and on and on until
It all comes back

"Anti-Curse"

Getting deep
I'm out of my depth at a public beach
I never listened, I had to see for myself
It's coming in waves
Shoots through my mind like a pinball straight
Friendly fire, point blank

Salt in my lungs
Holding my breath
Making peace with my inevitable death

I guess I did alright, considering
Tried to be a halfway decent friend
Wound up a bad comedian
An honest fool with more bad habits than you can count

There we were
Was anyone ever so young
Breaking curfew with illegal fireworks
Unpacking God in the suburbs

I'm swimming back

You say you don't have to make it bad
Just 'cause you know how

Writing the words
To the worst love song you've ever heard
Sounding out the foreign characters
An incantation like an anti-curse
Or even a blessing

"Letter To An Old Poet"

I said I think that you're special
You told me once that I'm selfish
And I kissed you hard
In the dark
In the closet

You said my music is mellow
Maybe I'm just exhausted
You think you're a good person
Because you won't punch me in the stomach

And I love you
I don't know why
I just do

But you're not special, you're evil
You don't get to tell me to calm down
You make me feel like an equal
But I'm better than you and you should know that by now

When you fell down the stairs
It looked like it hurt and I wasn't sorry
I should've left you right there
With your hostages my heart and my car keys

You don't know me
I wanna be happy
I'm ready
To walk into my room without looking for you
I'll go up to the top of our building
And remember my dog when I see the full moon

I can't feel it yet
But I am waiting

"Black Hole"

In a rainstorm
Sucking down a dart
On the back porch
Out here, it gets so dark
You can see the stars, the ones the headlines said
This morning were being spat out
By what we thought was just destroying everything for good

White teeth
Black light
White tee
Brown eyes
Bad boy
Big fight
You're a
Good guy

Good day
Good night
Good talk
Goodbye
It's out of your hands, but
Have a
Safe flight

My thoughts
All noise
Fake smile
Decoys
Sometimes
I need
To hear
Your voice

"Afraid Of Heights"

I know that I fucked up when I
Told you I'm afraid of heights
It made you wanna test my courage
You made me climb a cliff at night
You wanted me to jump and I declined
You called me a coward, I replied
"I don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna die tonight"

When the black water ate you up
Like a sugar cube in a teacup
I got the point you were makin'
When I held my breath 'til you came up

There's been a run of fires downtown
On half-built construction sites
I know you never liked a townhouse
I've seen you climb a crane at night
If they ever catch you at it
I know you'd want me to be proud
That you took a rich man's dream
And brought it with you on your way down

"'Cause one man's dream is another man's death"
I remember when you told me that
Didn't know what to say, so I just laughed
But now I know it's not funny

I never rode a motorcycle
I've never smoked a cigarette
I wanna live a vibrant life
But I wanna die a boring death
I know I was a disappointment
Know you wanted me to take a risk
Not everybody gets the chance to live
A life that isn't dangerous

You called me a crybaby
But you're the one who got teary
Tellin' me what you believe
How we're stuck in entropy
How it hurts to hope
Oh, it hurts to hope for more
Oh, it hurts to hope the future
Will be better than before

"Voyager"

Mmm, mmm

It's a hundred and three in the Valley
Blacktop is meltin' on our shoes (Mmm)
And I don't mean to make it all about me (Mmm)
But I used to believe no one could love you like I do (Mmm)
And I'm startin' to think that it might be impossible not to (Mmm)

There are days spent tangled up together (Mmm)
And sometimes, you let me read your mind (Ooh)
Then there are nights you say you don't remember
When you stepped on the gas and you asked if I'm ready to die (Mmm)
You thought I'd never leave and I let you believe you were right (Mmm)

Walkin' alone in the city
Makes me feel like a man on the moon (Ooh)
Every small step I took was so easy (Mmm)
But I never imagined a dot quite as pale or as blue (Ooh)
You took it from me, but I would've given it to you (Mmm)

"Powers"

How did it start Did I fall into a nuclear reactor
Crawl out with acid skin or somethin' worse
A hostile alien ambassador
Or am I simply another of the universe's failed experiments
Either way, I have been wonderin' just how it is (How it is)
I have never heard (Never heard) the tale of how I got my powers

Thrust into bein', careenin' along
On a crooked little trajectory
Dissolvin' in movement, a body in orbit
Or a roach on his way to the gutter

The tail of a comet burned up in an instant, the destruction of matter
There's no object to be seen in the supercollider
Just a light in the tunnel and whatever gets scattered
Life flashin' before the eye of whatever comes after
The force of our impact, the fission
The hum of our contact, the sound of our collisions

"Boyfriends"

She's out on the back deck
Talking to her marigolds
Sitting in a sundress
Listening to bands nobody knows

You don't have to do that
They're either gonna die or they will grow
Guess you're talking to yourself then
You can never stand to be alone
Time can be a savage
It will bring you peace but makes you old
Hell is gonna have it
She says, "Get a fucking job or just come home"

But you're not gonna go back
You never liked the freezing snow
Stuck out in the midwest
Standing at another house show

You always wanna save them
You think that you can change them
I think you're blaming yourself
But you say the medication, it helps

Calling in the morning
Asking me to analyze your dreams
What happened to your boyfriend
You don't think about him when you sleep
I guess that's why you're sleeping
I guess that's why you're gardening
Back out on the coast again
Looking for a second chance

You always wanna save them
You think that you can change them
I think you're blaming yourself
But you say the medication, it helps

What happened to your boyfriend
What happened to your boyfriend
What happened to your boyfriend
What happened to your boyfriend"Dominic"

Oh, let them talk while we lie in the grass
It flatters the world even if it won't last
Forgive me if I was too forward too fast
But not being yours would be wasteful

Oh, Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after
Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

Oh, let them talk while you reach for my hand
Replacing a drowning idea of a man
And when we get home with our shoes filled with sand
We'll just sleep and forget that we're strangers

Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after
Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

And when you step out that door
You'll leave me unafraid of change
And I...
And when you step out that door
You'll leave me unafraid of change

Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

"Dominic (French Version)"

Oh, laisse les parler pendant que l'on dort sur le sable
Cela flatte le monde, mme si a ne durera pas
Or pardonne moi de m'tre emporte si vite
Ce serait un gchis de ne pas tre  toi

Dominique, toi et moi
C'est un exquis dsastre
Nos chemins se sparent  l'aube du lendemain
Dominique, toi et moi
C'est un exquis dsastre
Nos chemins se sparent  l'aube du lendemain

Oh, laisse les parler alors que tu prends ma main
Estompant le souvenir de l'empreinte de quelqu'un
Et quand nous rentrons, les cheveux sals par l'air marin
On s'endort et oublie qu'on se connait presque pas

Dominique, toi et moi
C'est un exquis dsastre
Nos chemins se sparent  l'aube du lendemain
Dominique, toi et moi
C'est un exquis dsastre
Nos chemins se sparent  l'aube du lendemain

Emporte cette partie de moi
Dans laquelle je me reconnais pas

Emporte cette partie de moi
Dans laquelle je me reconnais pas
Dominique
(Toi et moi, c'est un exquis dsastre)
Dominique
(Toi et moi, [])

"Arcadia"

Cars they were passing
Waves they were crashing on the shore
Fingers were burning the pages they're turning
And I want more
Here I ran from the west
Unto ruins where the sun dances with death

Arcadia, Arcadia
Now she holds me tight like I held you
Arcadia, Arcadia
Hour after hour golden blue

To be had...

Arcadia, Arcadia
Now I know that time forgets us too
Arcadia, Arcadia
Hour after hour golden blue

"Backwards And Upwards"

Love
What a mean
Poison arrow welcome to me
What a shot
When I
Bent over to tie shoe laces
Cut it out
At the seed
And the rip is a rotation
Drawing O
In the sky
With no answers in the jury

Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Backwards and up, up, up up

Take the wheel

Oh, the driver is fine
But the passenger is carsick
Back it up
Turn around
Like a ferris wheel I shift it
"Oh, it burns
But it cleans"
Say the nurses in their tunics
"Just admit
You were wrong
It's the opposite of foolish"

Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and up, up, up up

Backwards
Backwards
Uh huh, backwards, backwards
Words, words, words

"Getaway Ride"

Pass the screwdriver
(Cha cha cha)
Here's a key
To the courtyard
By the cemetery
(Cha cha cha)
When the world is watching
I'll take the easy way out
To wait until your signal
While you burn the place down

I'll pick you up from where you hide
In uniform with tie untied
No talking baby just the slamming of the doors
Of our getaway ride

So what
(what now)
Of this
(this is)
Desire
(Cha cha cha)
I'm a thief
(Blind thief)
In the schoolyard
(baby)
Or just wanting to be
(Cha cha cha)
Breaking single file
Tell me you want to escape
Down the road to nowhere
To watch my heart break

I'll pick you up from where you hide
In uniform with tie untied
No talking baby just the slamming of the doors
Of our getaway ride

So what
And so what

Ride We can make it
Oh, I've all but lost my mind
Take the rest of me
Take it all
You're my destiny
Ooh
Baby don't be ashamed

Ride...
Ride...

"Avenues"

Between the buoy of dreaming
And the anchor of home
I had you
Leaning into the beams
In the fading heat
I showed you yours, you showed me mine

All my avenues are green
No trembling or goodbye
But the shadows know I miss you
Dearly, dearly
So sincerely

Under buoys of dreams
Above an anchor home
I found you
And though you can't call me lover
I'm a star in your sky
Baby, I'm a loner by design

All my avenues are green
As heartache is unwise
Ashes scatter of what happened
Nearly, nearly
So sincerely

"Lady's Got Gills"

Why is your pretty friend wearing her collar high
Why does she turn away when you look at her in the eye
It gives me the chills
It's like you to want the one
The one that you couldn't keep
Watch how she holds her breath
And leaves when you go to sleep

The lady's got gills
There's nothing you can do about it, yeah
The lady's got gills
There's nothing you can do about it, yeah

You'd give everything you have
If she'd just promise to come back
From her unexplained trips to the harbor
Where the tide runs black
There's no sense in trading places
To lock her up and keep her in the bath
Or learn how to hold her breath

The lady's got gills
There's nothing you can do about it, yeah
The lady's got gills
There's nothing you can do about it, yeah

Watching from the shore
No, you don't want to lose her
To the roar insatiable
Would you rather drown than say goodbye

"Dominic"

Oh, let them talk while we lie in the grass
It flatters the world even if it won't last
Forgive me if I was too forward too fast
But not being yours would be wasteful

Oh, Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after
Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

Oh, let them talk while you reach for my hand
Replacing a drowning idea of a man
And when we get home with our shoes filled with sand
We'll just sleep and forget that we're strangers

Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after
Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

And when you step out that door
You'll leave me unafraid of change
And I...
And when you step out that door
You'll leave me unafraid of change

Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

"Reprise"

Cold, unworthy, fickle heart
That's all too late in learning
That if I should love you till the last
I'll leave you be

"Izzit True What They Tell Me"

The second you offered me a ride
I couldn't get the thought out of my mind
Promises open when they're pried
Up with the vapor of a week of sighs
The cards say, "A change is coming near
And as a nestling on the bough
The fool is the martyr of the now"

Izzit true what they tell me
Izzit true what they tell me
Izzit true what they tell me
Izzit true what they tell me

Inviting you in a second time
How your possessions were lighter than mine
And how we talked all through the night
As if I'd have known you all of my life
Touching your finger to my eye
How you prove the card was right
That said you'd be all I have in sight

Izzit true what they tell me
Izzit true what they tell me
Izzit true what they tell me
Izzit true what they tell me

Ay, is the lesson cast asunder
Oh, and you can't even know
What kind of lack that you're leaving
Ay, want a rented bed of sorrow
Go to hell I adore you
Ay, ever-righteous call of thunder
Oh, I don't know what to call it
But I know that you feel it
Ay, ever-wretched call of wonder
With no regrets...
Now I receive you on the day
I hide and seek you on the hour
(In time)
In odysseys of no and yes
Even now, as a witness...
And even now...

Am I a finch, am I the cage
O either way I couldn't care
If you could see inside my head
Where every clock is stopped by you
Like in some silent threat
Like I'm the one that should be careful
Though it never could've happened without you
No it never could have happened without you...

Budding interrupted
In glory of their matching
Winding up the rope
Together and alone
Tell me a story
Leaving out the ending
I don't want to know
Whose heart was made to roam

Izzit true what they tell me
Izzit true what they tell me
Izzit true what they tell me
Izzit true what they tell me

"Wings Of The Parapets"

The wings of the parapets
Watch over the stage of joy and rage
They watch as I catch flight
And you fill the fuel to give me a ride

Here above the open ledge
With no control of which to speak
Oh, if love is a dependency
Resign me

Hear, a dove in the cargo bay
An-hundred miles beneath his feet
Oh, if love is the opposite of free
Resign me

"The Gate"

Standing at the gate
I come here every day
Just to see your face
Just to hear you say
"There's no need to wait
We will be okay"
'Cause finally there's a way
To be both free and safe

"Pang"

There's a look in your eyes when you're hungry for me
It's a beautiful knife cutting right where the fear should be

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me

Tell me what you're afraid of
Tell me what night is made of
What can I not destroy for you
Color the night electric
Get in me like a secret
I open the door and you run through

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me

Color the night electric
Get in me like a secret
I open the door and you run through

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me

(Tell me what you're afraid of)
There's a look in your eyes when you're hungry for me
(Tell me what you're afraid of)
It's a beautiful knife cutting right where the fear should be

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me

Color the night electric
Get in me like a secret
I open the door and you run through

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me

Into you (Pang)
Into me (Pang)
Into you (Pang)
Into me (Pang)
Oh, woah, oh
Into me (Pang)
Into you (Pang)

"New Normal"

Now, what is this
Feeling I know you from long ago
From deep in my past
I don't know why
Why I trust you completely
Don't question it
The bottle is empty

Now, what is this
Club closing early
The fog machines
And lasers swirling
It's Halloween
I'm sorry for screaming
But I'm afraid
I scare you completely

Now, what is this
Blizzard in April
I'm underdressed as usual
And you're cheating death
Buying time through the winter
It's house arrest
No stopping for dinner

Now, what is this
Microphone working
Can't hear myself
The cameras are rolling
And there's the cue
My heart, it beats so hard
I look for you, and suddenly fall

Now, what is this
Robin you rescued
Has broken wing
Not broken long
You search the room
Someone yells from the garden
The orange cat
Finish what you started

Now, what is this
Skidding of tires
I hold my breath
And you're running fast
As the SUV
Smashes into the sidewalk
And 911
Won't answer the call

Now, what is this
Hollywood ghost town
A shootout scene
No actors at all
Last night I dreamed
You and I were immortal
It's no big deal
This new kind of normal

"Hit Me Where It Hurts"

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
Go on and hit me in the

Bullseye, dead end
Moving target
Carousel, carousel
Baggage, claim it
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out
Ride it out, ride it out

Magic carpet
Over London
Through the ceiling
Watch you dreaming
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out
Ride it out

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
Go on and hit me in the

Blind spot, Achilles' heel
Long shot, left field
Vertigo, vertigo
High stakes, popped ears
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out
Ride it out, ride it out

Do you feel safe
(Hit me where it hurts now)
Now that you've found my cure
I'll be the nurse
(Hit me where it hurts now)
You'll be my number one
Hit me where it hurts now
Hit me where it hurts
Hit me where it hurts now
Hit me where it hurts
Hit me where it hurts now
Hit me where it hurts
Hit me where it hurts now

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane (Hit me where it hurts)
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
Go on and hit me in the

"I Give Up"

When I stop caring, you stop caring
When I care less and you care less than me
When I don't need and I don't believe in
The hollow phrases you still repeat
You and I, we fall apart
Now I know what it means to unravel
It's a new and shallow grief
A pathetic kind of sad relief

It didn't used to feel this good to be all alone
Doing every damn thing I can to not go home

I give up
I give up on you now
I give up
How far can you fall
When you're already down

I gave you that told-you-so look, it's so crazy
And you gave me that list of things about myself to change
And now these days it's every night, babe
It's not a rough patch, it's not a phase
You and I, we fall apart
Now I know what it means to unravel
It's a new and shallow grief
And a pathetic kind of self-defeat

It didn't used to feel this good to be all alone
Doing every damn thing I can to not go home

I give up
I give up on you now
I give up
How far can you fall
When you're already down
I give up
I give up on you now
I give up
How far can you fall
When you're already down

"Look At Me Now"

Wrote myself a letter
Just a single question
When you finally get this
Where will you be
Will you be a shipwreck or a star
Falling for a boy who doesn't play guitar
Now rewind the tape back to the start
Said I'd never leave you, but here we are

And you can't look at me now
I haven't changed, I'm still the same
But you can't look at me now
A hand grenade to throw away

Now my friends all tell me
"Girl, you're getting skinny
Have you not been sleeping"
How could I be
Trying to find the lightswitch in the dark
Burying the good girl I know I'm not
Now rewind the tape back to the start
Said I'd never leave you, but here we are

And you can't look at me now
I haven't changed, I'm still the same
But you can't look at me now
A hand grenade to throw away

I can't run anymore
Gotta stay right here and face the storm
I can't run anymore
Where the wakeup call is all I know
I can't run anymore
(I can't run anymore)
Gotta stay right here and face the storm
I can't run anymore
(I can't run anymore)

You can't look at me now
I haven't changed, I'm still the same
But you can't look at me now
A hand grenade to throw away
Look at me now
(I can't run anymore)
You can't look at me now
(I can't run anymore)

"Insomnia"

How long can sunlight stay warm in the storm
How long 'til the bath runs cold

Come dawn, come day, come half-awake
Come blue, come gray, come waves that break
And it's not enough
No reply, no relief

Dreams of dried fields
That once were green
Burnt by someone just like me

Come dawn, come day, come half-awake
Come blue, come gray, come waves that break
And it's not enough
No reply, no relief

Hold on
Hold on
To save a single living piece of us
I still got it
I still got your heat

"Ocean Of Tears"

This is gonna be torture
Before it's sublime
Does that make it crazy
Cash in all of my courage
Before you're all mine
Does that make it crazy

Oh my god, I wanna know what it feels like
To pull you close and tangle up with you real tight
The only thing that's separating you and me tonight
Ah, is an ocean of tears
Oh my god, I wanna know what it feels like
Just an inch away from living a dream life
The only thing that's separating you and me tonight
Ah, is an ocean of tears

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Show me the future
Yeah, I'm all eyes
Tell me you're ready (I'm ready)
Pulse was rising and racing and racing and racing
But it's a long ride
Tell me you're ready

Oh my god, I wanna know what it feels like
To pull you close and tangle up with you real tight
The only thing that's separating you and me tonight
Ah, is an ocean of tears
Oh my god, I wanna know what it feels like
Just an inch away from living a dream life
The only thing that's separating you and me tonight
Ah, is an ocean of tears

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Someone stop me, I'm coming down
Ooh, ooh
Someone stop me, I'm coming down
Ooh, ooh

Show me the fu-fu-fu-, fu-fu-
Yeah, all eyes

"Hey Big Eyes"

I can picture you right now
At a window seat
Crying for nobody except the world
I can picture you right now
Running down the street
Late for nobody except the moon

Hey, big eyes, can you swim
Swim down to me
Hey, red star, can you burn
Burn down to me

Picture me all messed up now
Can't talk to nobody
Cant plan for anything
Except the rain
Today the flags will all fly green
At the embassies
You're here next to me
Except you're not

Hey, big eyes, can you swim
Swim down to me (Swim, swim)
Hey, red star, can you burn
Burn down to me (Burn, burn)

Hey, big eyes, can you swim
Swim down to me
Hey, red star, can you burn
Burn down, burn down

Hey, big eyes, can you swim
Swim down to me (Swim, swim)
Hey, red star, can you burn
Burn down to me (Burn, burn)

"Go As A Dream"

Someone changed the clock
And left the window open
When I must have drifted off
And it's just your kind of trick
To leave me empty-handed
Leave me with a riddle unsolved

Ah, ah, mmm
I don't know if I can do this
I don't know if I can make this peace

And you're almost like that card
Played by the magician
But this time, you're not coming back
And it's slipping through my fists
Blurry at the edges
Leaving only legend

You go as a dream
Go as a dream
Go as a dream
Go as a dream

Ah, ah, mmm
I don't know if I can do this
I don't know if I can make this peace

And it hit me like a brick
A joke without a punchline
A script that nobody read
If you saw me lying here
Through my bedroom ceiling
You would have me pick up my head and

Go as a dream
Go as a dream
Go as a dream
Go as a dream

Ah, ah, mmm
Ah, ah, mmm

"Caroline Shut Up"

Sometimes, I wonder
Do I love you too much
Then I tell myself, "Caroline, shut up"
'Cause there's only one way
One way to find out
If it ever gets better than right now

I dare you to come closer
Let me see you in the light
I dare you to stay with me
You know I get low sometimes
I dare you to make time stop
Instead of speeding up
I dare you to go slow, don't rush

Sometimes, I wonder
Do I love you too much
Then I tell myself, "Caroline, shut up"
'Cause there's only one way
One way to find out
If it ever gets better than right now

Na, na, na, na (Oh)
Now you got me jealous and I'm not the jealous type
Na, na, na, na (Oh)
Spending all the cash that I'm saving up
Na, na, na, na (Oh)
Lying in the bath made of a fountain of wine
Na, na, na, na (Oh)
Looking like a god, you know you fuck me up

Sometimes, I wonder
Do I love you too much
Then I tell myself, "Caroline, shut up"
'Cause there's only one way
One way to find out
If it ever gets better than right now

And this is hard, God
Give me scissors and I'm running on the tightrope
And I've gotta trust it now, ah
Just don't let go
(Sometimes I, sometimes I, sometimes I)

Sometimes, I wonder
Do I love you too much
Then I tell myself, "Caroline, shut up"
If tomorrow, you want me
Then I don't have a doubt
That it gets even better than right now

"So Hot You're Hurting My Feelings"

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Not like I'm counting the days (Ah, ah, ah)
But it's been twenty-five (Ah, ah, ah)
You're out there killing the game (Ah, ah, ah)
But damn, I miss you tonight (Ah, ah, mmm)

And I'm out at a party, they're playing our song
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing
Don't send me photos, you're making it worse
'Cause you're so hot it's hurting my feelings

I get a little lonely
Get a little more close to me
You're the only one who knows me, babe
So hot you're hurting my feelings (Woo)
Can't deal

With all the -rated dreamin' (Ah, ah, ah)
Back on the coast-to-coast life (Ah, ah, ah)
You know I live for the hustle (Ah, ah, ah)
But damn, I miss you tonight (Ah, ah, mmm)

And I'm out at a party, they're playing our song
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing
Don't send me photos, you're making it worse

"Door"

Back in the city
I'm just another girl in a sweater
Perpetual novice
Signature on a check made out to you

Took ten laps 'round the planet
To prove what I wasn't
And the door slams hard behind you
When you leave the house of judgment

Been waiting for regret to hit me
Some kind of reckoning
I waited for the drop, 'cause lately
The yang comes with yin

Back in the city
I'm just another girl in a sweater
Perpetual novice
Signature on a check made out to you
Now there's the sunset
Salt in the wound, yeah
Sometimes I don't know who I'm singing to
Who is the you who I sing to
When the house is empty

You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you
You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you

And we're waking up sore and dizzy
From a ten year concussion
And the rainfall makes you miss me
Even though you say it doesn't

Back in the city
I'm just another girl in a sweater
Back in the city
Everything's different when we're not together

You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you
You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you

Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running

Back in the city
I'm just another girl in a sweater
Perpetual novice
Signature on a check made out to you
Now there's the sunset
Salt in the wound, yeah
Sometimes I don't know who I'm singing to
Who is the you who I sing to
When the house is empty

You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you
You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you

Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running
Oh, oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Ooh, ah

Ooh, oh
Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running

"Parachute"

Awake from a dream
One that started as a nightmare
Like a war so extreme
It erased itself from memory
Here's where I jumped
From the aeroplane without questioning it
The curve of the coast of Los Angeles
Spreading itself below

And blooming overhead, the parachute
I've got to trust it now, oh

Change in the wind
And I'm drifting from the crescent
Pulled farther out
From the shore than where I can swim to it

And blooming overhead, the parachute
I've got to trust it now, oh

Closing in on the sparkle of the waves
Go on, take me, it will feel like going home
Go on, take me, I'm not afraid to drown
What is this, pulling me back the other way
To strip malls, highways, and treetops
Landing on the soft ground

"Welcome To My Island"

Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
Hope you like me, you ain't leavin'
Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
Hope you like me, you ain't leavin'

Desire (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna turn into you
Desire (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna turn into you
Flood (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
The ocean blue
Flood (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Welcome to my island

Welcome to my island
Hope you like me, you ain't leavin'

I wanna turn into you
Desire (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna turn into you
Flood (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
The ocean blue
Flood (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
The ocean blue

I am my father's daughter in the end
He says, "Watch your ego, watch your head, girl
You're so smart, so talented
But now the water's turning red
And it's all your fault and it's all your mess
And you're all alone, you can't go to bed
Too high on your adrenaline
You gotta go somewhere where you can't pretend, oh
Forget the rules, forget your friends
Just you and your reflection
'Cause nothing's gonna be the same again
No, nothing's gonna be the same again"

Desire (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Flood (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da (Mmm)

Time's running out, innit
Pity the mayflies in the swimming pool at dawn
But down in the deep
I can't be left alone
Sweet Eliza's on the court
Potential is the drug
They never knew, you never tried
But you see it in my eyes, and that is bae
Threading the needle, pretty in possible
If only to get me out the door
Oracle and odyssey
With a bloody nose
If I'm on your street, you'll be the last to know
That I get dizzy (Yeah), dizzy (Yeah) and I cannot afford that kind of free

Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da

Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da (Being so, you know)
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da (Rich), da-da (Mmm)

Now you got one eye on the lane and one eye on the lava
Spinning out, yeah, I respect that
But I was born to get you home
Home, where it's all red and velveteen
Falling back into the leaves
So true
With your lipstick on my thigh
Drink the tears until they dry-y-y
I-I, I-I, I-I (Eye eye eye eye eye)

Mm-mm-mm, oh
Pretty in possible
Mm-mm-mm, oh
Pretty in possible
Mm-mm-mm, oh

"Bunny Is a Rider"

Bunny is a rider
Satellite can't find her
No sympathy, hmm
Ain't nothing for free
Bunny is a rider
Satellite can't find her
No sympathy, hmm
Ain't nothing for free
Bunny is a rider
No sympathy, hmm
Ain't nothing
Bunny is a-Bunny is a, a rider
Satellite can't find her
No sympathy, hmm

But I'm so non-physical
I do, I do, feel like the lady
I do, I do, fireworks blazing
I do, I do, heart is unbreaking
I do, I do, but don't drop my name

Bunny is a rider (Bunny is a r...)
Satellite can't find her
No sympathy, hmm
Ain't nothing for free
Bunny is a rider
Giddy up, can't find her
No sympathy, hmm
Ain't nothing for free

Dirty like it's earth day
Tryna wet that palette
Can you cut that check
Crush that wreck
Run out empty on 'em
AWOL on a Thursday
Tryna go ask Alice
Tryna catch that rabbit

But I'm so non-physical
I do, I do, feel like the lady
I do, I do, fireworks blazing
I do, I do, heart is unbreaking
I do, I do, but don't drop my name

Bunny is a-Bunny is a, a rider

"Sunset"

These days
I wear my body like an uninvited guest
I turn it right and right and right
Instead of turning left
But boy, your patience is a magic kind of medicine
'Cause every spiral brings me
Back into your arms again

So no regrets
'Cause you're my sunset
Fiery red
Forever fearless
And in your arms
A warm horizon
Don't look back
Let's ride away
Let's ride away

So many stories we were told about a safety net
But when I look for it, it's just a hand that's holding mine
I'm wearing black to mourn the sudden loss of innocence
And that's alright because it hides the dirt and hides the wine

So no regrets
'Cause you're my sunset
Fiery red
Forever fearless
And in your arms
A warm horizon
Don't look back
Let's ride away
Let's ride away

So no regrets
'Cause you're my sunset
Fiery red
Forever fearless
And in your arms
A warm horizon
Don't look back
Let's ride away (Let's ride away)

"Crude Drawing Of An Angel"

Draw the blinds
Draw the bath
It's a matter of time
Til you wake up and watch me
Draw your brow
With shaky hand
So that after you're gone
I got something to hold onto

Red light
Oh my faults
Camera one, camera two
Oh my greed
On your side, on the carpet
Oh your need
Camera one, camera two

Angel
I'd hold you down
Forsake me
Here on the ground
All or nothing

Draw your blood
Draw your breath
Skip the whites of your eyes
Til you wake up and watch me
Draw your wings
From your back
I'll not be shy
No, I'll not be gentle with you

Red light
Oh my faults
Camera one, camera two
Oh my greed
On your side, on the carpet
Oh your need
Camera one, camera two

Angel
I'd hold you down
Forsake me
Here on the ground
All or nothing

All or nothing

"I Believe"

(Look over the edge, but not too far)

You're not alone
Under a sky of vultures
With all that could've been
You made it home
With silver string unbroken
Ain't that the sweetest gift

Oh, little miracle
Swing low
Where there can be no compromises
Down low

I don't know but I believe
We'll get another day together
Violent love, feel my embrace, oh
No, I don't know but I believe

And I'd have said it was impossible
To find you in this life and keep you just enough

Oh, little miracle
Swing low
Where there can be no compromises
Down low

I don't know but I believe (Oh)
We'll get another day together (Oh)
Violent love, feel my embrace, oh (Oh)
No, I don't know but I believe

(Look over the edge, but not too far)
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh (Look over the edge, but not too far)
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh

I don't know but I believe
We'll get another day together
Violent love, feel my embrace, oh
No, I don't know but I believe (Ah)

Violent love, feel my embrace
(Look over the edge, but not too far)
(But not too far)

"Fly To You"
(feat. Grimes & Dido)

How I remember, how I forget
Wanted to hate you but love you instead
Violence made me gentle at last
Closer and closer and closer to you
Baby, I'm dying to find you

Ooh, I fly to you (Hey)
After all the tears (Hey)
You're all I need (Hey)
I fly to you (Woo)
Not just somewhere
Deep inside of me (Hey)

Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah (Hey)
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah (Hey)
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah (Woo)
Ah-ah

Driving through the dark
Lost but I'm free
I'm looking for something
That nobody else can see (See)
Will you still love me
After the bend (The bend)
Remember what's gone before
Not loaded with regret (Regret)

Ooh, I fly to you (Hey)
After all the tears (Hey)
You're all I need (Hey)
I fly to you (Woo)
Not just somewhere
Deep inside of me (Hey)

(Hey)
(Hey)
(Woo)

Mmm, I fly to you
After all the tears
You're all I need
I fly to you
Not just somewhere
Deep inside of me (How I remember)
Ooh, I fly to you (How I forget)
After all the tears (Wanted to hate you, but love you instead)
You're all I need (violence made me)
I fly to you (Gentle at last)
Not just somewhere (Closer and closer and closer to you)
Deep inside of me (Baby, I'm dying to find out)

I'm looking for something
Nobody else can see
Remember what's gone before
Not loaded with regret

"Blood And Butter"

I look at you, in denim and bows
I know the mode, the mode is lethal
Say you wanna show me your place
The place is here, the here is inside you
Where did you come from, you

I'm pretty with the critical mass
Your body has the body power
Layin' at the foot of a linden
In the navel ring, inventing June
Where did you come from, you

And what I want is, to walk beside you
Needing nothing, but the sun that's in our eyes
Paint the picture in blood and butter
Holy water, fire in sky

Let me dive through your face
To the sweetest kind of pain
Call you up, nothin' to say
No, I don't need no one entertaining
When the world is a bed
Give me green and ribbon red
Oh, get closer than your new tattoo

Look at you all mythicalogical
And wikipediated
Look how I forget who I was
Before I was the way I am with you
Where did you come from, you

And what I want is, to walk beside you
Needing nothing, but the sun that's in our eyes
Paint the picture in blood and butter
Holy water, fire in sky

Let me dive through your face
To the sweetest kind of pain
Call you up, nothin' to say
No, I don't need no one entertaining
When the world is a bed
Give me green and ribbon red
Oh, get closer than your new tattoo

Closer than your

"Hopedrunk Everasking"

Starlight in the tunnel
Kind of familiar
Hope-drunk ever-asking
How does it feel to know
Your final form
So old, so new

Pull close to me
And never be alone
Ooh

Real life is a rumor
Under the theatre
Deeper, dig it deeper
Till the meanwhile slows
They'll find our bones
And yet, they won't

Pull close to me
And never be alone
Ooh (Ah)

(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Dawn is just a headspace
Night is a feeling
Hope-drunk ever-asking
Centuries come and go
They'll find our bones
And yet, they won't

"Butterfly Net"

Earth went silent
London fell asleep
She dreamed of winter
Where you appeared to me
Perfect timing as new petals in November
A tender creature
A fever
Disarming, fluorescent

There you were
With your mirror
Shining the world all over me
There I was
With my butterfly net
Trying to catch your light

I collected
Stupid ashes
So that after you'd gone
I could hold onto something
But you stayed unwavering
Through every false goodbye
Unsubsiding
Pining
For now and for never

There you were
With your mirror
Shining the world all over me
There I was
With my butterfly net
Trying to catch your light

Oh if only
The umbrella of the sky
Could wrap us up and up
That's where I'd zoom in close
Dilated as your eyes
But til then I'll keep it brief

Faithful inertia
Her bullet doesn't slow
It seeks and finds me
How far it goes
Heaven help me
Take this bag of wings
And drown it in the thames
And wake tomorrow
Hollow
Hardly forgetting

There you were...
There I was
With my butterfly net
Trying to catch your light

"Smoke"

It's just smoke
Na-na-na, na-na-na
N-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
N-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
N-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na

It's just smoke
Floating over the volcano
It's just smoke
Go on, you know I can't say no

It's just smoke
Na-na-na, na-na-na
N-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
N-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
N-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na

It's just smoke
Floating over the volcano
It's just smoke
Selling me out on the down low

And you are
The big answer tonight
And you are
Melting everything about me, oh
Don't worry about me
It's just smoke

(Mmm)
(Ah, mmm)

And the fallout doesn't phase me
Take a bullet for my baby
For the one thing that'll save me
I know (Hmm)
Throw it all out and replace it
With a brand new kind of crazy
Don't believe it when you praise me
Do I (Hmm)

And you are

"Billions"

Psycho, priceless
Good in a crisis
Working the angles, oh, oh
Billions

Sexting, sonnets
Under the tables
Tangled in cables, oh, oh
Billions

Salting, flavour
Lies like a sailor
But he loves like a painter, oh, oh
Billions

Hand it over, broker
Give me the closure
Here's a pearl of the oyster, oh, oh
Billions

Say, say, say, say something to me
Say, say, say, say something to me

Headless, angel
Body upgraded
But it's dead on arrival, oh, oh
(Billions)

Twisted, manic
Cornucopia
Can my cup overflow with, oh, oh
(Billions)

I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you (I never felt so close to you)
(I never felt so close to you)

Psycho, priceless
Good in a crisis
Working the angles, oh, oh
Billions

Hand it over, broker
Give me the closure
Here's a pearl of the oyster, oh, oh
Billions

(Oh, oh) Say, say, say, say something to me
(Oh, oh) Say, say, say, say something to me

Oh, I've never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you
I never felt so close to you

Sippin on chartreuse

"Hit Me Where It Hurts (Toro Y Moi Remix)"
(feat. Chino Moreno)

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
Go on and hit me in the

Bullseye, dead end
Moving target
Carousel, carousel
Baggage, claim it
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out
Ride it out, ride it out

Magic carpet
Over London
Through the ceiling
Watch you dreaming
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out
Ride it out

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
Go on and hit me in the

Blind spot, Achilles' heel
Long shot, left field
Vertigo, vertigo
High stakes, popped ears
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out

Do you feel safe
Now that you've found my cure
I'll be the nurse
You'll be my number one

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time

"Last Days Non Voglio Mai Vedere Il Sole Tramontare"

Oh, la mia vita
Tutta la mia vita
Ti ho cercato
Ho cercato il tuo tocco
Come un'alba
Come un vulcano
Abbi piet di me
Abbi piet di me
Non voglio mai vedere il tramonto

Oh, la mia vita
Non ho mai amato cos tanto la vita
(Ho amato cos tanto la vita)
Non voglio che finisca mai

"Oh Yeah (Caroline Polachek Remix)"

Oh yeah, say I knew you
Oh yeah, like you knew me
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let me read your mind
For the final time

But I know what you're feeling (I feel it, too)
I know that you're falling (Falling away)
I know what you're thinking (Say the word)
I know that it's o, oh, oh oh oh

Oh yeah (Oh yeah, yeah, yeah), so alive
So let me tell you how to do it right
You only got one life

Oh yeah, you don't need it
No, yeah, just believe it
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we can make amends
Right before it ends

But I know what you're feeling (I feel it, too)
I know that you're falling (Falling away)

"So Cold You're Hurting My Feelings"

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Not like I'm counting the days (Ah, ah, ah)
But it's been twenty-five (Ah, ah, ah)
You're out there riding the sleigh (Ah, ah, ah) (Ho-ho-ho)
But damn, I miss you tonight (Ah, ah, mmm)

And I'm out at a party, they're playing our song
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing
Don't send me presents, you're making it worse
'Cause you're so cold it's hurting my feelings

I get a little lonely
Get a little more close to me
You're the only one who knows me, babe
So cold you're hurting my feelings (Woo)
Can't deal

With all the mistletoe dreamin' (Ah, ah, ah)
Back on the coast-to-coast life (Ah, ah, ah)
You know I live for the Tinsel (Ah, ah, ah)
But damn, I miss you tonight (Ah, ah, mmm)

And I'm out at a party, they're playing our song
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing
Don't send me presents, you're making it worse
'Cause you're so cold it's hurting my feelings

I get a little lonely
Get a little more close to me
You're the only one who knows me, babe
So cold you're hurting my feelings (Woo)
Can't deal

I'm a good girl santa (Na-na-na-na-na)
I'm a good girl santa (Na-na-na)
I'm a good girl santa (Na-na-na-na-na)
I'm a good girl santa (Na-na-na-na)

And I'm out at a party, they're playing our song
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing
Don't send me presents, you're making it worse
'Cause you're so cold it's hurting my feelings (Ho-ho-ho)

I get a little lonely
Get a little more close to me
You're the only one who knows me, babe (Only one who knows me, babe)
So cold you're hurting my feelings (Woo)

"Welcome To My Island (George Daniel & Charli C Remix)"

I like to live my life luxurious
Eating caviar toast, buying out the Ritz
I've been told I can be tricky in relationships
'Cause I need someone who can take on all the challenges
I won't lie, yeah, I've always been afraid to commit
But now I've fallen so hard, it's a total eclipse
'Cause it's emotional and physical and so legit
He's got my legs wide out like banana split
We're always showering each other in expensive gifts
I put the two-tone Cartier on his wrist
It was love at first sight from the moment we kissed
I want a white dress, country side house, and kids
Back at the start, think you knew that I was dangerous
With my face enhanced and my natural lips
I told him, "Catch a flight, see if you can handle it
And if you can then, welcome to my island, bitch"

Welcome to my island, bitch
Welcome to my island, bitch
Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island, bitch
Welcome to my island
I wanna turn into you

I guess I'm on my Richard Branson wave
No virgin, but I knew just how to behave
'Cause I can be a good girl, buxom milkmaid
Or you can drive me down to Florida and fuck me for days
Back at the start, think you knew that I was dangerous
I've done a couple bad things if you catch my drift
I told him, "Baby, you can pull up on the landing strip
And if you do it right, welcome to my island, bitch"

Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island, bitch
Welcome to my island
I wanna turn into you
Welcome to my island, bitch
Desire
I wanna turn into you
Welcome to my island, bitch
Desire
I wanna turn into you

Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
Hope you like me, you ain't leavin'
Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
I wanna turn into you

I wanna turn into you
I wanna turn into you
