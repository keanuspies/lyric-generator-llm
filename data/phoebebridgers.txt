"Smoke Signals"

I went with you up to
The place you grew up in
We spent a week in the cold
Just long enough to
"Walden" it with you
Any longer, it would have got old
Singing "Ace of Spades" when Lemmy died
But nothing's changed, L.A.'s all right
Sleeping in my bed again, and getting in my head
And then walk around the reservoir

You, you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach

One of your eyes is
Always half-shut
Something happened when you were a kid
I didn't know you then
And I'll never understand
Why it feels like I did
"How Soon Is Now" in an '80s sedan
You slept inside of it because your dad
Lived in a campground in the back of a van
You said that song will creep you out until you're dead

And you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach

I want to live at
The Holiday Inn
Where somebody else makes the bed
We'll watch TV while
The lights on the street
Put all the stars to death
It's been on my mind since Bowie died
Just checking out to hide from life
And all of our problems, I'm gonna solve 'em
With you riding shot-gun, speeding, 'cause fuck the cops

And you, you must have been looking for me
Sending smoke signals
Pelicans circling
Burning trash out on the beach

I buried a hatchet
It's coming up lavender
The future's unwritten
The past is a corridor
I'm at the exit looking back through the hall
You are anonymous
I am a concrete wall

"Motion Sickness"

I hate you for what you did
And I miss you like a little kid
I faked it every time but that's alright
I can hardly feel anything
I hardly feel anything at all

You gave me fifteen hundred
To see your hypnotherapist
I only went one time, you let it slide
Fell on hard times a year ago
Was hoping you would let it go and you did

I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out

I'm on the outside looking through
You're throwing rocks around your room
And while you're bleeding on your back in the glass
I'll be glad that I made it out
And sorry that it all went down like it did

I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out

And why do you sing with an English accent
I guess it's too late to change it now
You know I'm never gonna let you have it
But I will try to drown you out

You said when you met me you were bored
You said when you met me you were bored
And you you were in a band when I was born

I have emotional motion sickness
I try to stay clean and live without
And I want to know what would happen
If I surrender to the sound
Surrender to the sound

"Funeral"

I'm singing at a funeral tomorrow
For a kid a year older than me
And I've been talking to his dad, it makes me so sad
When I think too much about it I can't breathe

And I have this dream where I'm screaming underwater
While my friends are all waving from the shore
And I don't need you to tell me what that means
I don't believe in that stuff anymore

Jesus Christ, I'm so blue all the time
And that's just how I feel
Always have and I always will
I always have and always will

I have a friend I call
When I've bored myself to tears
And we talk until we think we might just kill ourselves
But then we laugh until it disappears

And last night I blacked out in my car
And I woke up in my childhood bed
Wishing I was someone else, feeling sorry for myself
When I remembered someone's kid is dead

Jesus Christ, I'm so blue all the time
And that's just how I feel
Always have and I always will
I always have and always will

And it's 4 AM, again
And I'm doing nothing
Again

"Demi Moore"

Take a dirty picture, babe
I can't sleep and I miss your face
In my hands and in my knees
Tell me what you wanna do to me
Tell me what you'll do, please

I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone anymore

You got quiet on the other line
Said the sun was coming up
And I laughed until I couldn't breathe
Now I'm too tired to go to sleep
Now I can't breathe, and I can't sleep

I don't wanna be stoned
I don't wanna be stoned anymore

Don't wanna be alone
Don't wanna be alone anymore

I could feel alone
I could, I got a good feeling
It doesn't happen very often

"Scott Street"

Walking Scott Street, feeling like a stranger
With an open heart, open container
I've got a stack of mail and a tall can
It's a shower beer it's a payment plan

There's helicopters over my head
Every night when I go to bed
Spending money and I earned it
When I'm lonely, that's when I'll burn it

Do you feel ashamed
When you hear my name

I asked you "How is your sister?
I heard she got her degree"
And I said, "That makes me feel old"
He said, "What does that make me?"

I asked you "How is playing drums?"
You said it's too much shit to carry
"And what about the band?"
You said they're all getting married

Do you feel ashamed
When you hear my name

Anyway, don't be a stranger
Anyway, don't be a stranger
Don't be a stranger

"Killer"

Sometimes I think I'm a killer
Scared you in your house
Even scared myself by talking
About Dahmer on your couch

But I can't sleep next to a body
Even harmless in death
Plus I'm pretty sure I'd miss you
And faking sleep to count your breath

Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
Is there nothing left to do for us?
I am sick of the chase
But I'm hungry for blood
And there's nothing I can do

But when I'm sick and tired
When my mind is barely there
When a machine keeps me alive
And I'm losing all my hair

I hope you kiss my rotten head
And pull the plug
Know that I've burned every playlist
And given all my love

Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
I know there's something waiting for us
I am sick of the chase
But I'm stupid in love
And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can do

"Georgia"

Georgia, Georgia I love your son
When he gets older, he might be the one
He might be the one
Georgia, Georgia he has beautiful bones
And he never lies or picks up his phone

Sometimes in the pouring rain
He'll fall in the mud and get back up again
And if you find me
Will you know me
Will you take me
Or will you fall

Here is my day plan, my new machine
He is a fine new addition, so young and so clean
So young and so clean
He came up through the water without a sound
With my back to the shoreline, I dreamt that he drowned
I dreamt that he drowned

Sometimes when he looks at me
I know that he needs you, you're all that he sees
And if I had breathed you
Will it kill me
Will you have me
Or watch me fall
If I had fixed you
Will you hate me
Would you fuck this
And let us fall

"Chelsea"

For a chemical imbalance, you sure know how to ride a train
Your revolution is a deathbed, and the music is your maid
When someone comes a knocking with a needle on a tray
Only your lonesome lies beside you
For you told me not to stay
You are somebody's baby, some mother held you near
No it's not important, they're just pretty words, my dear
There is no distraction that can make me disappear
No there's nothing that won't remind you
I will always be right here

And you spit the blood back, spit the blood back
Baby, I'm amazed that you're alright
Oh, so long prison boy, I won't be home with you tonight

We're both very sick, our muscles all worn down
It's as if we are one-hundredâ€”no, I won't still be around
Because I've fallen, yes I've fallen right into the love I found
Long before I reach one-hundred
I'll have fallen to the ground
And for generations
Their romances make us more
It's much less than than ever was before, the Chelsea and the floor
Make us stand before the masses like two speakers for the poor
When there was no revolution
Nothing we were fighting for

And you spit the blood back, spit the blood back
Baby, I'm amazed that you're alright
Oh, so long prison boy, I won't be home
I won't be home
I won't be home with you tonight

And you can call the service bell
When we stay at the Chelsea hotel
And I'll stay out of my own head

Oh, so long prison boy, I won't be home
I won't be home
I won't be home with you tonight

"Would You Rather"

Playing would you rather
When it comes to fire
You always say that you'd prefer to drown
You were still in the ambulance
When the cop suggested
You're the one who tried to burn it down

Come to find out
I'm a can on a string, you're on the end
We find our way out
Of a suicide pact of our family and friends
In the background I'll be waiting

We have the same face
I laid awake
As someone shoved you up against a wall
Quarantined in a bad dream
He's half the man
And you're twice as tall

Come to find out
I'm a can on a string, you're on the end
We find our way out
Of a suicide pact of our family and friends
In the background I'll be waiting

Next time I see you you'll show me
A hundred different ways to say the same things

Come to find out
I'm a can on a string, you're on the end
We find our way out
Of a suicide pact of our family and friends
And when you touch down I'll be waving

"You Missed My Heart"

Broke into her house, saw her sitting there
Drinking coke and whiskey in her bra and underwear
Saw him in the kitchen, hanging up the phone
I asked him nicely once to pack his things and go

He gave her a reassuring look, said he wouldn't leave
But I asked him one more time, this time pulled out my shiv
Struck him in the back and I pulled it out slow
And I watched him fall down, and as the morning sun rose
He looked at me and said

"You missed my heart, you missed my heart
You got me good, I knew you would
But you missed my heart, you missed my heart"
Were his last words before he died

Looking out the window, up at the blue sky
Listening to her scream, listening to her cry
A feeling of relief came over my soul
I couldn't take it any longer and I lost control

I chased her up the stairs and I pinned her to the ground
And underneath her whimpering I could hear the sirens sound
I rattled off a list of all the things I missed
Like going to the movies with her and the way she kissed me

Driving into downtown Wheeling, showing her off
Backyard barbecues and reunions in the park
I said I missed her skin and when started laughing
And while I clenched down on her wrist, she said "that's quite a list
But there's one thing you missed

"You missed my heart, you missed my heart
That's quite a list, but what you really missed
You missed my heart, you missed my heart
That's quite a list, but what you really missed"

Running through the parking lot, running through the fields
Policemen on my back, something hit my skull and cracked
They dragged me off to jail, set a million dollar bail
Where I tried to tie a noose, but I failed and I broke loose

I went racing through the prison yard, shot down by a tower guard
He got me in the shins, and he got me in the arms
They strapped me in the gurney, took me off to the infirmary
Where the priest read my last rites
And just before, everything went dark

I said: "He missed my heart, he missed my heart
He got me good, I knew he would
But he missed my heart, he missed my heart"
And just before, everything went dark

The most poetic dream came flowing like the sea
Laying there my lifeblood draining out of me
A childhood scene then, sky moon beams
Fishing with my friends sitting in the wild reeds

Watching the Ohio river flow at night
Waiting for the bullhead catfishes to bite
Downriver from the Moundsville prison graveyard...

"It'll All Work Out"

She wore faded jeans and soft black leather
She had eyes so blue they looked like weather
When she needed me I wasn't around
That's the way it goes, it'll all work out

There were times apart and times together
I was pledged to her for worse or better
When it mattered most I let her down
That's the way it goes, it'll all work out

It'll all work out eventually
Better off with him than here with me

Now the wind is high and the rain is heavy
The water's rising in the levee
Still I think of her when the sun goes down
Never goes away, but it all works out
Never goes away, but it all works out

"Garden Song"

Someday I'm gonna live
In your house up on the hill
And when your skinhead neighbor goes missing
I'll plant a garden in the yard then
They're gluing roses on a flatbed
You should see it, I mean thousands
I grew up here till it all went up in flames
Except the notches in the doorframe

I don't know when you got taller
See our reflection in the water
Off a bridge at the Huntington
I hopped the fence when I was seventeen
Then I knew what I wanted

And when I grow up, I'm gonna look up
From my phone and see my life
And it's gonna be just like my recurring dream
I'm at the movies
I don't remember what I'm seeing
The screen turns into a tidal wave
Then it's a dorm room, like a hedge maze
And when I find you
You touch my leg and I insist
But I wake up before we do it

I don't know how, but I'm taller
It must be something in the water
Everything's growing in our garden
You don't have to know that it's haunted
The doctor put her hands over my liver
She told me my resentment's getting smaller
No, I'm not afraid of hard work
I get everything I want
I have everything I wanted

"Kyoto"

Day off in Kyoto, got bored at the temple
Looked around at the 7-11
The band took the speed train, went to the arcade
I wanted to go but I didn't
You called me from a payphone, they still got pay phones
It costs a dollar a minute
To tell me you're getting sober and you wrote me a letter
But I don't have to read it

I'm gonna kill you
If you don't beat me to it
Dreaming through Tokyo skies
I wanted to see the world
Then I flew over the ocean
And I changed my mind

Sunset's been a freak show
On the weekend so I've been driving out to the suburbs
To park at the Goodwill and stare at the chem trails
With my little brother
He said you called on his birthday
You were off by like ten days
But you get a few points for trying
Remember getting the truck fixed when you let us drive it
25 felt like flying

I don't forgive you
But please don't hold me to it
Born under Scorpio skies
I wanted to see the world
Through your eyes until it happened
Then I changed my mind

Guess I lied
I'm a liar
Who lies
'Cause I'm a liar

"Punisher"

When the speed kicks in
I go to the store for nothing
And walk right by
The house where you lived with Snow White
I wonder if she ever thought
The storybook tiles on the roof were too much
But from the window, it's not a bad show
If your favorite thing's Dianetics or stucco

The drugstores are open all night
The only real reason I moved to the east side
I love a good place to hide in plain sight

What if I told you
I feel like I know you?
But we never met

And here, everyone knows you're the way to my heart
Hear so many stories of you at the bar
Most times, alone, and some, looking your worst
But never not sweet to the trust funds and punishers

Man, I wish that I could say the same
I swear I'm not angry, that's just my face
A copycat killer with a chemical cut
Either I'm careless or I wanna get caught
Who I'm not

What if I told you
I feel like I know you?
But we never met
It's for the best

I can't open my mouth and forget how to talk
'Cause even if I could
Wouldn't know where to start
Wouldn't know when to stop

"Halloween"

I hate living by the hospital
The sirens go all night
I used to joke that if they woke you up
Somebody better be dying
Sick of the questions I keep asking you
They make you live in the past
But I can count on you to tell me the truth
When you've been drinking and you're wearing a mask

Baby, it's Halloween
We can be anything
Come on, man
We can be anything

Always surprised what I'd do for love
Some things I'd never expect
They killed a fan down by the stadium
Was only visiting, they beat him to death

Baby, it's Halloween
We can be anything
Come on, man
We can be anything

Baby, it's Halloween
There's a last time for everything
Come on, man
We can be anything

Whatever you want
I'll be whatever you want
Whatever you want
Be whatever you want
I'll be whatever you want
(Whatever you want)
I'll be whatever you want
(Whatever you want)
(Whatever you want)

"Chinese Satellite"

I've been running around in circles
Pretending to be myself
Why would somebody do this on purpose
When they could do something else?
Drowning out the morning birds
With the same three songs over and over
I wish I wrote it, but I didn't so I learn the words
Hum along 'til the feeling's gone forever

Took a tour to see the stars
But they weren't out tonight
So I wished hard on a Chinese satellite
I want to believe
Instead I look at the sky and I feel nothing
You know I hate to be alone
I want to be wrong

You were screamin' at the Evangelicals
They were screamin' right back from what I remember
When you said I will never be your vegetable
Because I think when you're gone it's forever
But you know I'd stand on the corner
Embarrassed with a picket sign
If it meant I would see you
When I die

Sometimes when I can't sleep
It's just a matter of time before I'm hearing things
Swore I could feel you through the walls
But that's impossible
I want to believe
That if I go outside I'll see a tractor beam
Coming to take me to where I'm from
I want to go home

"Moon Song"

You asked to walk me home
But I had to carry you
And you pushed me in
Now my feet can't touch the bottom of you

You couldn't have, you couldn't have
Stuck your tongue down the throat of somebody
Who loves you more
I will wait for the next time you want me
Like a dog with a bird at your door

We hate Tears in Heaven
But it's sad his baby died
We fought about John Lennon
Until I cried
Then I went to bed upset

Now I'm dreaming
And you're singing at my birthday
I've never seen you smiling so big
It's nautical themed
And there's something I'm supposed to say
Can't for the life of me remember what it is

And if I could give you the moon
I would give you the moon

You are sick, and you're married
And you might be dying
But you're holding me like water in your hands
When you saw the dead little bird, you started crying
But you know the killer doesn't understand

"Savior Complex"

Emotional affair
Overly sincere
Smoking in the car, windows up
Crocodile tears, run the tap 'til it's clear
Drift off on the floor
I drag you to the shore
Sweating through the sheets
You're gonna drown in your sleep for sure

Wake up and start a big fire
In our one room apartment
But I'm too tired
To have a pissing contest
All the bad dreams that you hide
Show me yours, I'll show you mine

Call me when you land
I'll drive around again
One hand on the wheel, one in your mouth
Turn me on and turn me down

Baby, you're a vampire
You want blood and I promised
I'm a bad liar
With a savior complex
All the skeletons you hide
Show me yours and I'll show you mine

All the bad dreams that you hide
Show me yours

"I See You"
(ICU)

Laying down on the lawn
I'm tired of trying to get in the house
I'm thinking out loud
I've been playing dead
My whole life
And I get this feeling whenever I feel good
It'll be the last time

But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you

If you're a work of art
I'm standing too close
I can see the brush strokes
I hate your mom
I hate it when she opens her mouth
It's amazing to me how much you can say
When you don't know what you're talking about

But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you

I used to light you up
Now I can't even get you to play the drums
'Cause I don't know what I want
Until I fuck it up

But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something

I'll climb through the window again
But right now it feels good not to stand
Then I'll leave it wide open
Let the dystopian morning light pour in

"Graceland Too"

No longer a danger to herself or others
She made up her mind and laced up her shoes
Yelled down the hall but nobody answered
So she walked outside without an excuse

She could do anything she wants to
She could do whatever she wants to do
She could go home, but she's not going to

So she picks a direction, it's ninety in Memphis
Turns up the music so thoughts don't intrude
Predictably winds up thinking of Elvis
And wonders if he believed songs could come true

I'm asking for it if they do
Doesn't know what she wants
Or what she's gonna do
A rebel without a clue

So we spent what was left of our serotonin
To chew on our cheeks and stare at the moon
Said she knows she'll live through it to get to this moment
Ate a sleeve of saltines on my floor and I knew that

I would do anything you want me to
I would do anything for you
I would do anything
I would do anything
Whatever you want me to do, I will do

Whatever she wants
Whatever she wants
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
I would do anything (Whatever you want)
I would do anything (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)
Whatever she wants (Whatever you want)

"I Know The End"

Somewhere in Germany, but I can't place it
Man, I hate this part of Texas
Close my eyes, fantasize
Three clicks and I'm home
When I get back, I'll lay around
Then I'll get up and lay back down
Romanticize a quiet life
There's no place like my room

But you had to go, I know, I know, I know
Like a wave that crashed and melted on the shore
Not even the burnouts are out here anymore
And you had to go, I know, I know, I know

Out in the park, we watch the sunset
Talkin' on a rusty swing set
After a while, you went quiet
And I got mean
I'm always pushin' you away from me
But you come back with gravity
And when I call, you come home
A bird in your teeth

So, I gotta go, I know, I know, I know
When the sirens sound, you'll hide under the floor
But I'm not gonna go down with my hometown in a tornado
I'm gonna chase it, I know, I know, I know
I gotta go now, I know, I know, I know

Drivin' out into the sun
Let the ultraviolet cover me up
Went looking for a creation myth
Ended up with a pair of cracked lips
Windows down, scream along
To some America First rap-country song
A slaughterhouse, an outlet mall
Slot machines, fear of God
Windows down, heater on
Big bolt of lightning hanging low
Over the coast, everyone's convinced
It's a government drone or an alien spaceship
Either way, we're not alone
I'll find a new place to be from
A haunted house with a picket fence
To float around and ghost my friends
No, I'm not afraid to disappear
The billboard said "The End Is Near"
I turned around, there was nothing there
Yeah, I guess the end is here

The end is here
The end is here
The end is here
The end is

"If We Make It Through December"

If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be all right, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine

Got laid off at the factory
And their timing is not the greatest in the world
Heaven knows I've been working hard
Wanted Christmas to be right for my girl
I don't mean to hate December
It's meant to be the happy time of year
And my little girl don't understand
Why we can't afford no Christmas gear

If we make it through December
Everything's gonna be all right, I know
It's the coldest time of winter
And I shiver when I see the falling snow
If we make it through December
Got plans to be in a warmer town come summertime
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine
Maybe even California
If we make it through December, we'll be fine

"7 O'Clock News / Silent Night"

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

"Christmas Song"

Comin' back from the country
For the good food and lousy beer
This winter's so dry and the dirt road so dusty
At the lightest fall of rain, the bacteria bloom

You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it

Tethered to a table with that happy holiday crowd
And it's anchors aweigh
Looks like smooth sailin'
But the merest hint of waves could capsize you

You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it

The desire for annihilation
Is as common as it is unkind
And it's hard to recognize the situation
When you're desperately tryin' to have a good time

You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it

Yeah, it's Christmas
So no one can fix it

"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Next year all our troubles will be miles away

Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us, once more

Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll have to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now

"Coming Down"

I miss the drip in the back of my throat
Sometimes I miss my bloody nose
Two heads underwater, together we drowned
But nothing feels better when you're coming down
Nothing feels better when you're coming down

There's nothing that I won't believe
Waves are crashing over me
When a beautiful voice makes an awful sound
Well, nothing feels worse when you're coming down
Nothing feels worse when you're coming down

He said, "I need air, I need space"
One of us will die in this place
I see the fire through these clouds
I'll never have to feel it if I never come down
Never have to feel it if I never come down
Never have to feel it if I never come down

No mirrors on the table
No cab to the Chelsea Hotel
When it's freezing cold and I'm not able to tell

I see the rooftops disappear
How did I end up down here?
Am I falling asleep or blacking out?
Need you here if I ever come down
Need you here if I ever come down

It's the first time in months I've slept a whole night
You never once left my bedside
But don't you worry about me now
Just hold my hand and lay me down
Hold my hand and lay me down
Hold my hand and lay me down
Nothing feels better when you're coming down

"Sidelines"

I'm not afraid of anything at all
Not dying in a fire, not being broke again
I'm not afraid of living on a fault line
'Cause nothing ever shakes me, nothing makes me cry

Not a plane going down
In the ocean and drowning

Watched the world from the sidelines
Had nothing to prove
Till you came into my life
Gave me something to lose
Now I know what it feels like
To want to go outside
Like the shape of my outline

I'm not afraid of going back to school
I gave it up the first time, but I'll try again
I'm not afraid of getting older
Used to fetishize myself
Now I'm talking to my house plants

Not of being alone
In a room full of people

Watching the world from the sidelines
Had nothing to prove
Till you came into my life
Gave me something to lose
Now I know what it feels like
To want to go outside
Like the shape of my outline

And I used to think
You could hear the ocean in a seashell
What a childish thing

"Waiting Room"

If you were a teacher, I would fail your class
Take it over and over til you noticed me
If you were a waiting room, I would never see a doctor
I would sit there with my first aid kit and bleed

I want to be the power ballad that lifts you up and hold you down
I wanna be the broken love song that feeds your misery
And I can wish all I want, but it won't bring us together
Plus I know whatever happens to me
I know it's for the better

When broken bodies are washed ashore
Who am I to ask for more, more, more?
But you're breathing in my open mouth
You're the gun in my lips that will blow my brains out

I want to make you drive all night just because I said maybe you should come over
I want to make you fall in love as hard as my poor parents teenage daughter
She'll be the best you ever had if you let her

I know it's for the better...

"Whatever"

It's that teenage feeling, got me staying in bed
There is nothing on my mind but water in my head
It's got me falling for just anyone, at least thinking I did
And it leaves me hanging on like some idiot kid

But I knew I had it coming
Well I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming

Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da dum

It's that teenage sickness keeping me up all night
It's got me climbing up the walls just to pick a good fight
I don't want to be so desperate, oh what have I done
Oh but I can't be alone, I'll take anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone

This was a test, this was a test
This was a test, this was a test
This was a test, this was a test yeah baby
This, this was a test yeah baby
This, this was a test yeah baby

Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da
Bom bom bom ba dom bom ba da dum

I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming
I knew I had it coming

Whoa this was a test, this was a test
This was a test, this was a test
This was a test

"Wilt"

I've got a surgeon's precision and a drunk man's hand
They say I've stopped growin', so I do what I can
Nothin' ever changes but the cigarette brand
But don't panic, it's just routine
Don't panic, this is just routine

You've got roses on the brain, and I'm all wilt
You've got snowflakes in your veins, and I'm all melt
You don't got blame on your breath
God bless, but all I taste is guilt
Ooh

Misery will bury you
I'm so sorry if I'm scarin' you
What was I supposed to do
As opposed to lovin' you?

I've got a surgeon's hand and a drunk man's passion
Totally limbless and I'm ready for action
Nothin' ever changes but the taste of tobacco
But don't panic, it's just routine
Don't panic, this is just routine

You've got roses on the brain, and I'm all wilt
You've got snowflakes in your veins, and I'm all melt
You don't got blame on your breath
God bless, but all I taste is guilt
Ooh

Misery will bury you
I'm so sorry if I'm scarin' you
What was I supposed to do
As opposed to lovin' you?

You've got roses the brain, and I'm all wilt

But misery will bury you
I'm so sorry if I'm scarin' you
What was I supposed to do
As opposed to lovin' you?

"Turned Around"

I'm not crazy
I'm just nervous
I'm on my toes
At the edge of the world
And my mind feels like an empty room
The inside black as coal
And it hurts to want something so bad
That you lose all self control

And I know
How you are sometimes
And I know
You're just a little turned around

Yeah, I can feel it getting late
And my body is getting tired
But there's no point leaving before they game
When my mind feels so wired
Yeah, you took me to this station and you showed me every sign
No one else could understand
You know I'm lost but I'll be fine

And you know
How I am sometimes
And you know
I'm just a little turned around

We had it all planned out
It's so hard to watch it burn
Burn...
Watch it burn

Watch it burn

"Steamroller"

I am tired of being sad
I feel it when I wake up
And it just stays bad
It hits me like a sickness
Or a steamroller
Makes me wanna lay down
And get run over

But then I see you
Always smiling
Makes me wanna touch you
Keep from dying

You're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
You're the feeling I get
When I'm feeling fine

Part of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won't fall unless you ask me to

We talk for hours
Until finally
Sleep takes over
The amphetamines

In the darkness
I feel your fingers
They don't touch me
But there's a danger

You're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
Your the feeling I get
When I'm feeling fine

Part of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won't fall unless you ask me

You're a brother to me
You're my partner in crime
You're the feeling I get
When I'm feeling fine

Part of me wants you
But most of me needs you
So I won't fall unless you ask me
