"Hey L.A."

First time I saw you
I was kinda taken by surprise
You were, sun kissed, so full of bliss
You really had me mesmerized

And now it's something about the way
You do where you knock me off my feet
I'm lost inside of you
And I don't think I can leave

You already had me at "hello"
I said 'Hey L.A.'
It's really really nice to meet ya,
If it's okay I think I'll stay
Cause I just want to have some fun

Top down just chilling on the west side
Hands up get ready for a good time
'Hey L.A.'
It's really really nice to meet ya

Will somebody pinch me now
Cause it kinda feels like a dream
I got shades on my head, my feet in the sand
Ain't worried 'bout a thing

When the sun goes down
And the lights come on
You got me feeling just like a star
And no matter where I go
You'll always have my heart

You already had me at "hello"...
I said "Hey L.A."
It's really really nice to meet ya,
If it's okay I think I'll stay
Cause I just want to have some fun

Top down just chilling on the west side
Hands up get ready for a good time
'Hey L.A.'
It's really really nice to meet ya

Now if you can make it here
You can make it anywhere
And it's not always easy
But there's no place that I'd rather be

I said "Hey L.A."
It's really really nice to meet ya,
If it's okay I think I'll stay
Cause I just want to have some fun

Top down just chilling on the west side
Hands up get ready for a good time
'Hey L.A.'
It's really really nice to meet ya

Na na na na
L.A.
It's really really nice to meet ya
Cause I just wanna have some fun
Top down just chilling on the west side
Hands up get ready for a good time

Hey L.A.
It's really really cool to be here yeah

I'll meet you at In-N-Out
And let's go to the beach
I'm in L.A!...

"Like Me Or Not"

I don't care if you walk right by me with another guy see I got plenty of time,
Plenty of time...yeah,
You can blow me off, it won't make a differance, I won't listen, no changing it's mine,
No changing, it's mine.

Sometimes you look, right, through,
But all I see, is, all I see is you...yeah,

I'm kind of like a train that just won't stop,
Trying to put the key inside the lock,
Girl I'm gonna like you, like you, like me or not,
I ain't ever gonna lose this plot,
Waiting for you to connect the dots,
Girl I'm gonna like you, like you, like me or not,
Like me or not.

I don't care if you lose my number, ain't gonna crumble, ain't gonna fall to the floor,
I always got more...yeah,
You can tell all your friends that I'm not your type, but if you don't try me, how can you be sure,
Well how can you be sure.

Sometimes you look right through,
But all I see is, all I see is you...yeah.

I'm kind of like a train that just won't stop,
Trying to put the key inside the lock,
Girl I'm gonna like you, like you, like me or not,
I ain't ever gonna lose this plot,
Waiting for you to connect the dots,
Girl I'm gonna like you, like you, like me or not,
Like me or not.

Sometimes you just know,
That you shouldn't let go.
I'm kinda like a train that just won't stop, stop, stop,
Girl I'm gonna like you, like you, like me or not.

I ain't ever gonna lose this plot,
Waiting for you to connect the dots,
Girl I'm gonna like you, like you, like me or not.

"Give Myself A Try"

I looked in the mirror and realised,
I can be the one, be the one to change the world
Even though it seems impossible, sometimes
And I'm like maybe, just maybe,
Even though I'm not first place at the finish line,
I still won a prize inside, I tried.

Now I can't do everything, no.
I'm still gonna try, gonna try my best,
But I will do anything, yeah,
Anything for this dream of mine, yeah.

I'm gonna give myself a try,
Oh Oh Oh Oh,
My aim is to win,
So I'm gonna rise,
I promise to live,
Until the day I die,
I gotta give myself a try.

People try to, try to bring me down,
But no matter what, I'm never gonna ever change,
No matter what they try to say, to me,
I'm a winner, not a quitter,
And that is just the way that it's always gonna be,
That it's gonna be, gonna be.

Now I can't do everything, no.
I am still gonna try, gonna try my best,
But I will do anything, yeah,
Anything for this dream of mine, yeah.

I'm gonna give myself a try,
Oh Oh Oh Oh,

"Every Little Thing"

Hey oh, I saw you walkin' by my way so
I thought I would come over and say hello
To you right now
But when I tried to speak the words won't come out
It's you girl, it's definetly something you do girl
That's got my heart beating over time
When you're around
It's like you lift me up and I can come back down
I used to keep my feelings all to me
But now my heart's right on my sleeve for all to see

Because I, I want to be
Every little thing that you want,
That you need, that you breathe
And I know it might sound crazy
I think that it's amazing what you do to me
Oh maybe this could truly be
That I'm in love, in love, in love
Oh I'm in love, in love, in love

Oh you're my sunlight
You're my everything's going to be alright
The only thing I need in my life
From day to night my troubles disappear when you hold me tight
And I know I'll never find another like you
So I promise that I'll never let you go
You're all I need, 'cause baby without you I'm just not me

If this is somehow just all a dream
Then please just let me stay
Oh I just want to stay asleep

Because I, I want to be
Every little thing that you want,
That you need, that you breathe
And I know it might sound crazy
I think that it's amazing what you do to me
Oh maybe this could truly be
That I'm in love, in love, in love
Oh I'm in love, in love, in love

And if the stars fall from the sky
I'll pick them up for you, baby
'Cause you're the only reason why I wake up in the morning, baby
And it might sound a little too forward for me to say, but I'ma do it anyway
'Cause I think that this could mean, girl
That I, I want to be every little thing that you want,
That you need, that you breathe

And I know it might sound crazy
I think that it's amazing what you do to me
Oh maybe this could truly be
That I'm in love, in love, in love
Oh I'm in love, in love, in love
[x18]

"Simple Song"

It's just another lazy summer afternoon,
Summer breeze blowing into my bedroom
Before I even put my feet on the floor,
I start strumming the chords on my guitar,
It's just a C sharp minor, to the B major,
It sounds kinda like the summer breeze to me,
And it makes me want to sing.

It ain't complicated,
Just a little syncopating,
Maybe it's understated but I like it, I like it, oh.

It's just a simple song,
It's not gonna hurt if you sing along,
Maybe if it moves you, you can dance,
Cause all you really really want,
Is a tune you can hum till the break of dawn,
And everybody knows that it's the jam,
And it goes a little something like,
Lalalalalalaa,
It's just a simple song,
Lalalalalalaa,
Everybody sing along,
Lalalalalalaa, lalalala, yeah.

It's just another crazy Friday night,
All my friends hanging on the beach round the bonfire,
Someone writing on guitar, and they knew the chord.
It's just a C sharp minor, to the B major,
It sounds really good with the ocean waves,
And it makes everybody sing.

It ain't complicated,
Just a little syncopating,
Maybe it's understated but I like it, I like it, oh.

It's just a simple song,
It's not gonna hurt if you sing along,
Maybe if it moves you, you can dance,
Cause all you really really want,
Is a tune you can hum till the break of dawn,
And everybody knows that it's the jam,
And it goes a little something like,
Lalalalalalaa,
It's just a simple song,
Lalalalalaa,
Everybody sing along,
Lalalalalalaa, lalalala, yeah,
Lalalalala, it's just a simple song.

Ooooh, yeah, yeah. Oh.
It's just a simple song, oh yeah.
Ooh.

It's just another simple song,
It still sounds good if you sing it wrong,
Maybe you can move so you can dance,
Cause all you really really want is a tune you can sing till the break of dawn,
And everybody knows that it's the jam,
And it goes a little something like,
Lalalalalalaa, 3 chords and a melody,
Lalalalalaa, it's just a simple song,
Lalalalalalaa, lalalalalaa,
Lalalalalaa, and this is my simple song.

"Pretending"

Time, time is what you said that you were needing, away from me,
But I, I guess that I was too far in the distance, to even see,
The things between us now,
Just haven't quite been the same,
Can we figure out, which one of us is to blame,
'Cause I can't go on.

And Oh,
Why are we pretending?
Why are we just wasting time, on a love that isn't real?
Because if you don't want me,
You should just tell me now,
So I can save these tears.

You, you said that you would never,
Ever hurt me but I guess that was a lie,
'Cause it's killing me to watch you stay
When I, I know this is goodbye,
And it's hard for me to think,
That maybe this is the end, you were my heart,
Baby you were my bestfriend, but we can't go on.

And Oh,
Why are we pretending?
Why are we just wasting time on a love that isn't real?
Because if you don't want me,
You should just tell me now, so I can save these tears.

We tried to make it work but we just can't make it last,
We need to move on, stop living in the past,
And I'll even even know, how our love got so strange,
It's not the same.

And Oh,
Why are we pretending?
Why are we just wasting time, on a love that isn't real?
Because if you don't want me, you should just tell me now,
So I can save these tears.
Let me save these tears

"Love Will Come My Way"

She'll be shining
Where's she hiding?
Love will come my way
Sometimes I'm up
And sometimes I'm down
And I'm wondering if things are ever gonna turn around
One thing I know
Time changes all
And I spend most of mine just waiting for my turn to fall

Falling so hard for someone
When is that time gonna come?

Like a bright light, she'll be shining
Tonight, where's she hiding?
When the time's right
Love will come my way
Guess I'll keep on waiting
While she hesitating
When the time's right
Love will come my way
Love will come my wa-ay a-a-a-ay
wa-ay a-a-a-ay, wa-ay a-a-a-ay
Love will come my way

Everyone I see
They all got someone
Well me, I got no one
No one for me
Yeah I don't sweat it
But I just don't get it
There must be somebody
Out there for me

There'll be a time and a place
I'll know her when I'll see her face

Like a bright light
She'll be shining
Tonight, where's she hiding
When the time's right
Love will come my way
Guess I'll keep on waiting
While she hesitating
When the time's right
Love will come my way
Love will come my wa-ay a-a-a-ay
wa-ay a-a-a-ay, wa-ay a-a-a-ay
Love will come my way

Guess I'll keep on waiting
While she hesitating
When the time's right
Love will come my way
Love will come my
Wo-o wo-o-o-o-o wo-o
Wo-o wo-o-o-o-o wo-o
Wo-o wo-o-o-o-o wo-o
Love will come my way
Wo-o wo-o-o-o-o wo-o
Wo-o wo-o-o-o-o wo-o
Wo-o wo-o-o-o-o wo-o
Love will come my way

Like a bright light
She'll be shining
Tonight, where's she hiding?
When the time's right
Love will come my way
Guess I'll keep on waiting
While she hesitating
When the time's right
Love will come my way
Love will come my wa-ay a-a-a-ay
wa-ay a-a-a-ay, wa-ay a-a-a-ay
Love will come my way
Wa-ay a-a-a-ay
wa-ay a-a-a-ay, wa-ay a-a-a-ay
Love will come my way
Like a bright light
She'll be shining
Tonight, where's she hiding?
When the time's right
Love will come my way

"Could've Had Love"

We were burnin' up like a Summer love
Now you're telling me
That what we got ain't good enough
You don't want me 
You don't need me
Too bad, so sad
Enough with that
Ain't it funny
You were telling me
You'd never leave
Now you're telling me
That you're onto better things
This is farewell
This is goodbye
I'll be just fine
I'll be alright

When you show up asking me to come back
I'll be telling you

Girl you could've had 
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
But you're the one who walked away
So let me give it to you straight
Could've had
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
What we had was hard to find
But you want to leave it all behind
And that's okay

Girl you never miss a good thing 'till its gone
Now this good thing is moving on
I don't want ya
I don't need ya
So long, so done
You're not the one
And I hope you don't take it too personal
When you sing along to this on the radio
Every lyric, can you hear it?
The words are mine we had our time

When you show up asking me to come back
I'll be telling you

Girl you could've had 
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
But you're the one who walked away
So let me give it to you straight
Could've had
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
What we had was hard to find
But you want to leave it all behind
And that's okay

You can do whatever makes you happy
We'll tell you to stay
We'll stand in the way
I'll tell you'll be okay (my baby)
The future is right infront of you
Infront of you, yeah
Infront of you

Girl you could've had 
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
But you're the one who walked away
So let me give it to you straight

And that's okay

Oh, oh, oh
That's okay
I'm gonna be back
That's okay
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
And that's okay

"Underdogs"

Start from the beginning
Feels like it was yesterday
The best of my friends stay
The rest of em' fade away

Now there's nothing but green lights
The reason we stand in place
So time doesn't miss me
I move at a faster pace

Don't care what they say
They'll never change us (underdogs)
We live for today
And no one can blame us (Underdogs)

'Cause when you're the underdog,
They never get down,
All they do is stop and stare,
Under the surface,
We got a purpose,
We are the Underdogs

When you fall down, get up,
Then you'll be right back,
on track, on track

What is perception?
Its just a reflection of who i am
At school you were so cool
Now you're just a grown fool
These kids can be so cruel

Yeah, Yeah

Don't care what they say
They'll never change us (underdogs)
We live for today
And no one can blame us (Underdogs)

'Cause when you're the underdog,
They never get down,
All they do is stop and stare,
Under the surface,
We got a purpose,
We are the Underdogs

No I can't look down (underdog)
If i could do it again (underdog)
I wouldn't change a thing (underdog)
I'm living out my dreams, yeah
And I'm so close,
 I came too far to turn back now,
The world is at my feet
I know my destiny,
mission complete

Don't care what they say
They'll never change us (underdogs)
We live for today
And no one can blame us (Underdogs)

'Cause when you're the underdog,
They never get down,
All they do is stop and stare,
Under the surface,
We got a purpose,
We are the Underdogs

When you fall down, get up
You're just a beginning 
You're still just pretending
Then you'll be right back
on track, on track

When you fall down, get up
You're just a beginning 
You're still just pretending
Then you'll be right back
on track, on track

"Chameleon"

When the lights fade out
And the people go
I get to see a secret side of you no one has seen before
When we're all alone

Your colors always change
You never act the same with me
Chameleon
It's like you disappeared
There's someone else right here with me
Chameleon
I look into your eyes
And I don't recognize
The one who's sweet with me when nobody's around
Chameleon

Later with a crowd
You start acting differently
It's impossible to figure out what you're in this for
And what you want from me

Your colors always change
You never act the same with me
Chameleon
It's like you disappeared
There's someone else right here with me
Chameleon
I look into your eyes
And I don't recognize
The one who's sweet with me when nobody's around
Chameleon

Your colors always change
You never act the same with me
Chameleon
It's like you disappeared
There's someone else right here with me
Chameleon
I look into your eyes
And I don't recognize
The one who's sweet with me when nobody's around
Chameleon

"Haircut"

Wake me up when the days are over
Reminiscing of a life I had
I smile on and feel the closure
I finally feel like me again
Sacrifice, the sweet attention
You have to give before you get
Another lie, another lie
I'll get it right

It starts right now
Now
It starts right now
Right now
Oh I can never ever ever ever lose it
It's all I ever ever ever ever wanted, oh woah

Control myself, realized I couldn't
Too special to stay on the track
They look the same, I tried to fake it
But it left a bad taste in my mouth
I know I sound better when I'm nervous (yup)
But honestly I can't complain (no)
I feel alive, I really can, oh yes I can

It starts right now
Now
It starts right now
Right now
Oh I can never ever ever ever lose it
It's all I ever ever ever ever wanted, oh woah

Run home
Get back to where you came from
Don't be so afraid, no
This is what you're meant for
Run home
Get back to where you came from
Don't be so afraid, no
This is what you're meant for

"Euro"

You know, it's a free world
You can leave when you want
Take the money and run, run, run to me
Freeway, it's a free world
You can leave when you want
Take the money and run, run, run to me
Who are you when I'm not around?
Who are you when I'm not around?
White lines, you've been working all the time
Need to cool you down
I've been on the sidelines and I watch it fall apart

All my cash is in Euros
All my coins are in Yen
All my boys European
All my money is gone

Don't wanna rent cars, I wanna crash cars
I'm feeling NASCAR in mom and dad's car
I'm not suicidal, I'm too afraid to die
Wanna feel something other than sadness sometimes
Damn
I can't relate to the people who relate to me
Always late to the party that I don't wanna be
Can't trust them anyway, can't trust them anyway
They don't see me for me

You are special to me
You are special to me
You are special to me
You are special to me
You are special to me
You are special to me

I'll subtract all the gold
Reach a couple of goals
Take a trip to the bridge
See what it's really worth
All my cash is in Euros
All my coins are in Yen
All my boys European
All my money is gone

"Cupid"

Pitch black
I'm on the opposite side of the fence
Sneaking out for a kiss, yeah
Just to tell you I like you
There ain't nobody like you

Who you gonna dance with?
Who you gonna dance with?
Who you gonna dance with?

He's the only one on my mind
He's the only one I call when I'm feeling reckless
Tell me that you're mine
Open up your heart for a minute
Let me see the things you got hiding in it

Cupid got us fucked up
Drawing hearts on my skin
Throwing issues in there
Ain't it nice out here
on the baseball field
when we're alone?
Press your lips against my neck
With me you don't pretend that you're with your girlfriend
She's nice but she's not me
She's nice but hates me
Date me, I'm just playing
Didn't mean to say that
Sometimes kids say the dumbest things
But if you're down, so am I
I can't lie

Who you gonna dance with?
Who you gonna dance with?
Who you gonna dance with?

He's the only one on my mind
He's the only one I call when I'm feeling reckless
Tell me that you're mine
Open up your heart for a minute
Let me see the things you got hiding in it

What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I'll give it to you, you just gotta ask, yeah
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
I'll give it to you, you just gotta ask

And when we get older
And y'all break up someday
And this is not a secret
Maybe then you'll say you love me back
But until then I'll be dreaming about that

"Bruise"

This is not real, this is a memory
A real memory

I went to a dance with my high school girlfriend
Left from a dance without my high school girlfriend

Burning the books because life fucking bores me
So she's out there slow dancing to the song
And we're in the boys bathroom, making out, yeah

Super star, I wanna feel you shine on me

"Camo"

Why I got this gel in my hair for no reason?
Sitting in my bedroom with my headphones bleeding
Staring at my posters of these Japanese women
Dreaming of a day when it's worth what I'm seeing
Should I get my trophies out the box?
Should I hang my ribbons even though I lost?
Cross country was that fastest on the team
Cross country when I was only seventeen
Now the only thing I got are these memories
And a lot of time on my hands

Camo print depression
I keep my feelings hidden
No pills, no feels
I'm not used to winning, but that's life
That's life
Camo print depression
I keep my feelings hidden
No pills, no feels
I'm not used to winning, but that's life
That's life

What's gonna be my reputation?
[?] close to the bunk bed
One on top and one on the bottom
Is that a Flip Cam?
(Yeah man)
I got two
(Oh shoot)
One for the B-roll
And one for the docs
Cause that must mean nothing to me
My mama saw me on TV
Said she didn't recognize me

Mama saw me on TV
I'm not saying I'm a ride or die
Mama saw me on TV
Who to say what's wrong or right?
Mama saw me on TV
Mama saw me on TV
Mama saw me on TV
Mama turn the TV off

Camo print depression
I keep my feelings hidden
No pills, no feels
I'm not used to winning, but that's life

"Party's Over"

You've been on my mind
And I wonder if you will ever be mine
I'd like that
You've been on my mind
And I wonder if you will ever be mine
I like that

When you walk in
The room stops talking
The boys are flocking
They want you
Keep my distance
'Cause you're with him
Make a decision
Is he your lover or boyfriend?

Party's over
Wishing on a
Four-leaf clover
You'll come over
When we roll like this

Party's over
Wishing on a
Four leaf clover
You'll come over

We could be friends
We could be more than friends if you want to

They're not my friends
I just have them come over so I have a reason, to see you

You are a superstar
Seen every movie that you've been in
Let's make a movie tonight

Party's over
Wishing on a
Four-leaf clover

I don't wanna live without you
Couldn't see my life without you in it
I'd probably lose my fucking mind

I don't wanna live without you
Couldn't see my life without you in it
I'd probably lose my fucking mind

"Money"

When you've got friends
And you got that money
Honey, they're your friends until the money spent
Pay that bill
Trigger pulled too fast
Now you're driving home and you are all alone

Call me good, call me bad
Don't care what you say just call me bad
Money comes and people go
But I won't live forever
Call me good, call me bad
Don't care what you say just call me bad
People talk and walk away
But I won't live forever

I can't pay your rent today
I can't even pay attention
Been living no home for way too long
My job is driving me
I call my friends today (Hi)
I call my friends tomorrow (Bye)
I call but they're not enough
What the fuck?
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
What did I do wrong?
Someone else to fill my shoes
Who else are they counting on?
Did they find a place without me?
It can't be the same without me, without me
Without my money money money money money!

When you've got friends
And you got that money (and you got that money)
Honey, they're your friends until the money spent
Pay that bill (pay that bill)
Trigger pulled too fast
Now you're driving home and you are all alone

Call me good, call me bad
Don't care what you say just call me bad
Money comes and people go
But I won't live forever
Call me good, call me bad
Don't care what you say just call me bad
People talk and walk away
But I won't live forever

Money money money money money!
Money money money money money!

Hmm, what's up to ya?
I can see through ya
When it comes down to it
Tell me what really makes you happy?
Do I make you happy?
What's up to ya?
I can see through ya
When it comes down to it
Tell me what really makes you happy?
Do I make you happy?

Do I make you happy?
Do I make you happy?
Money money money money money!
Does my money make you happy?
Do I? Do I make you feel?
Money money money money money!

"God In Jeans"

God is real, he was sleeping in my bed last night
We were naked with the radio on
Played him favorite song

My love, he caught me crying
Freedom can die so hard
When you have a broken heart
Tears of joy
I pray to the open sky
This is the one I wanted
This is everything

Give me more, I'll be all your love
I believe in heaven above
Come and give me life
Show me what it's like to fall into your arms

God is real, he was sleeping in my bed last night
We were naked with the radio on
Played him favorite song

My love is my religion
Preaching the choir
Fueling the fire
Oh my God, you know I need ya
If I'm going to hell, I'm taking you with me
I'm taking you with me

Give me more, I'll be all your love
I believe in heaven above
Come and give me life
Show me what it's like to fall into your arms

God is real, he was sleeping in my bed last night
We were naked with the radio on
Played him favorite song
God is real, he was sleeping in my bed last night
We were naked with the radio on
Played him favorite song

So what do you think it is?
I don't know, I'm totally freaked out
It's probably aliens
No it's probably the government
Totally aliens, completely coming in to invade the, the you know the world right now with everything that's going on
I would be okay with that

"Crash"

Tough tension, I'm reckless
Harmony, Corin
They hate me, they love me
I'm indifferent
I'm indifferent
[?] on the handle
Jesus on my dash
Neutral colors on the centerfold
Fuck it, let's go fast

I'm gonna crash the car
I'm gonna crash the car

Two tone on the visual
Mixing colors with the grey
Bloody nose like in cinema
I don't got time for this today
I gotta pick me up a check
Get myself a gig
Look at that sunset
One sec, lemme take this pic
It's pretty

I'm gonna crash the car
I'm gonna crash the car
I'm gonna crash the car
I'm gonna crash the car

What gives at seven?
That's two hours from now
You got time for me I know you do
Staying up late
My insomnia's acting up
Or I am in love with ya, I don't know
Tracing the V on your abdomen
Like Siamese twins and making me feel precious
You little treasure
I could never let go of you
Even if I tried, even if you let me
I could never survive without you, without you, without you, without you

"Powerslide"

Suburban royalty
'Cause his neighbors let us use the pool
He gave me pleasure underneath the water
And it felt so good
Now we're power sliding till the flat spots stop us
They call the cops on us
The time tick tocks, you drop me off

Summer's over when I die
Can't let go of the heat, can't let go of your hand
I roll into the deep end
'Cause I wanna feel the wind blow while I ride
Sun's up, I glisten
You're good at transition

You could pass for masculine
But that's not why I like it, no no no no
Now we share a couple cigarettes before we go to bed
And you got the plastic, that's fucking fantastic
Now we're powersliding till we can both pass out
You got the TV on, with the volume down for colors in the background

Summer's over when I die
Can't let go of the heat, can't let go of your hand
I roll into the deep end
'Cause I wanna feel the wind blow while I ride
Sun's up, I glisten
You're good at transition

Summer's over when I die
Can't let go of the heat, can't let go of your hand
Roll into the deep end
'Cause I wanna feel the wind blow while I ride
Sun's up, I glisten
You're good at transition

Get lost!
His muscles flex when he takes
A puff from his cigarette
He's looking tough and so friendly
I'm im...
Get lost!
Stop, I'm taking your picture
Crack a smile through the lens
My god, I swear this is perfect
Let the sunset take us down
Get lost!
Ahh, ahh
Get lost!
Ahh, ahh

(It's cold!
Ryan could you skateboard for us?)

"Speed"

You got that tattoo from your best friend in your bedroom
You let him stick and poke you
You like French fry and the Fujicam flies and gold crew
It's good to get to know you

Do you speak Japanese?
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you do speed?
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you do speed?

I got my bleach hair and my hand-me-downs
And my Kafka tea
I saw it on the TV
Feel my pulse pump from the 808 drum
Like amphetamine
If you know what I mean

Do you speak Japanese?
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you do speed?
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you speak Japanese?
Do you do speed?

Baby girl is on the run
(Try sugar, no cream)
Pockets full of coins and guns
([?] and a magazine)
Watch her flash her [*beep*] for cash
(Take the white man's money)
Slushy lips and cherry wishes, blow the candles out
(Happy birthday)
God bless America
She can use her body for whatever
Do want you want
He can use his money for whatever
God bless America
She can use her body for whatever
Do want you want
He can use his money for whatever

"Pink Floyd"

Making the money to get by
Smoking the Pink Floyd every night
And I'm feeling sad 'cause everyday
I pay the price
Taking a walk to shake it off
I'm trying to believe in what I want
I don't what else I can say
I'm made this way

They say there's nothing to lose
But I lose it everyday
They say there's nothing to lose
But I lose it everyday

I'll find a place, I'll find a place
Somewhere special
I'll find a place, I'll find a place
Somewhere special

Mom and dad moved away from home
To Santa Clarita years ago
Just so that I could catch my dream
(I owe everything)
Honestly I could really cry
I hope that I looked back on their life
And see that I tried, I tried, I tried
(I tried, I tried, I tried)

They say there's nothing to lose
But I lose it everyday
They say there's nothing to lose
But I lose it everyday

I'll find a place, I'll find a place
Somewhere special
I'll find a place, I'll find a place
Somewhere special, special
I'll find a place somewhere special
I'll find a place, I'll find a place
Somewhere special

"Flash"

Head to my chest
I promise I won't cry
Try to impress
Falling to the sky

Life flashes before my eyes
I'm not ready to say goodbye

I'm so afraid
I see you in the dark
Don't say my name
I'll probably fall apart

Days like this are the reason why
I'm not ready to say goodbye
I, I

And before you realize it I'll be gone
And before you realize it I'll be gone

Life flashes before my eyes
I'm not ready to say goodbye
I, I

- I don't like it when you don't like me
- Well I don't like it when you don't like me
- I'm glad we're agreeing
- Huh?
- I said I'm glad we're agreeing

"Rhinestone"

Big boy knew a life jean jacket with the rhinestones
Cool kids said I'll never fall in love but I might though (I might though)
Got me feeling ways that I'll never feel, but I like the feel
First time, so fast, it was tight though
That's a body modification
'Cause you appear smart so

Forever changed, forever known
Going down, that's a lesson
Going up with the sky, fly, butterfly fly
Fly high

Come fly with me
There's so much more to see out there
You're the green
It's been a window right next to me

Flight down got me passing out fast from a cheap thrill
Woke up after noon, feeling good, took a Advil
But the jet lag ain't that bad, I'll get used to it (I'll get used to it)
Never seen your sky in the nighttime
That's a new area code
But you still look the same

Forever changed, forever known
Going down as a hero
Going up with the sky, fly, butterfly fly
Fly high

Come fly with me
There's so much more to see out there
You're the green
It's been a window right next to me
Come fly with me
There's so much more to see out there
You're the green
It's been a window right next to me

"In The End"

Met you in the dark and
Look how far it got us
Bawling in your arms
A camera was recording

Laughter from the patio
We were keeping quiet (all this hiding out) everything you said makes sense but I can't say goodbye yet

In the end
I believe in something I can't see
In the end
I believe in something I can't see

Sleep an hour, right up to sunday
Pull out the webcam, show off my body

I try to lay low, right below light strobes I want some touch from someone I don't know

Throw another dollar at a body builder
On me, he's on me
Wonderful, the sun is coming up now
On me, on me

In the end
I believe in something I can't see
In the end
I believe in something I can't see

I believe in something I can't see
I believe in something I can't see

Only time I find slumber
When it is you I am under

"Dark Circles"

Match me
When I tell you things
That no one knows about me
What keeps me up at night
What keeps you in my life

I left you
At a time when you were tryna get your life back
I'll probably end up somewhere in the limelight
What keeps me up at night
What keeps you in my life

I swear, if I could give you up, I would erase you
Get you out of my mind
It's all I think about
Let you go somewhere else
Try to let go, but I can't help

Alone in the clothes you let me borrow when the rain came
I'm laying down, and I can't help but daydream
Who do you idolize now?
Do you ever think about me?

Think about me
Think about me
Think about me

I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me
I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me

I think forever is too long
What does it mean to be loyal?
I put your jacket on
To make me feel important

I think forever is too long
What does it mean to be loyal?
I put your jacket on
To make me feel important

Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover

I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me
I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me
I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me
I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me
I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me

"Patchwork"

Clothes off
He needs to come through or cut me off
I understand why he hesitates

Go home
I'd rather be alone than soaked in sweat
Taking a dose to make me forget

Fell back into the hotel
Underneath the same lights
Eye contact was the last thing I wanted
While you looked like that
Jumped into the water
Let the iPhone speaker blaring
I can feel their eyesights glaring, classic
Glossed up and getting wasted
This is not my last masterpiece
I am Michelangelo

I still don't know how you feel about us
Boys in the backseat are talking about us

Cold sweat, coke head
I forgot your name in the same place last time
No thanks

Cold sweat, coke head
I forgot your name in the same place last time
No thanks

There's some men out there on the floor
Watching me lose myself to disco music

There's some men out there on the floor
Watching me lose myself to disco music

There's some men out there on the floor
Watching me lose myself to disco music

There's some men out there on the floor
Watching me lose myself to disco music

"Hawkshaw"

You walked all this way to show me signs
It was a hawkshaw song stuck in my mind
I turned my back for second
I don't know why now
You're a thousand miles out of California

Double pierce the ears
Take a stab at it, take a stab at it
Let's try to make this happen
Double pierce the ears
Take a stab at it, take a stab at it
Let's try to make this happen, yeah

You walked all this way to show me signs
It was a hawkshaw song stuck in my mind
I turned my back for second
I don't know why now
You're a thousand miles out of California

Rinse your hair in the faucet
I watch you do your thing through the screen shine
My lip glossing nobody knows we've been talking I had a couple boys
I met you, so I lost them you're so awesome

See me out your window (I'm tryna get to know you boy)
See me out your window (I'm tryna get to know you boy)
See me out your window (I'm trying trying trying trying trying)
See me out your window (are you paranoid?)

"Flowers At The Door"

Our heads connected
I got the message
You had your hands around my skull

Gave in to ashes
Passed up the acid
I look up to you when I'm below

Why don't you turn me around
Why don't you turn me around
Why don't you turn me around

Draw on the pages
I won't erase it
I want your mark on me, eternal

I cast a shadow
While I stand above you
It's all I ever wanted, a turn

Why don't you turn me around
Why don't you turn me around
Why don't you turn me around

What's so wrong with wanting more
Rolling on the hardwood floor
Show me what's like below
I'll be where the herons go

"Evergreen"

It was seven or so, cause the daylight was over
You got out of the robe and into the water
We're too familiar, we're too tethered
What comes after, what comes after

If there's nothing else round the corner
If there's nothing else round the corner
We can meet up right where we left off
If there's nothing else round the corner
If there's nothing else round the corner
If there's nothing else round the corner

Throw t off me
Show skin, surely
Thought we were evergreen
Now we're just on fire
I won't know free
Til he holds me
And I don't feel pleasure
When I'm up inside

Leave fast as I can, staying back could be bad (I lose sleep)
Thought of wanting you back,
I wrestle with that (I lose sleep)
I don't know where you are
I don't know if it's bad, no answer
What comes after, what comes after

If there's nothing else round the corner
If there's nothing else round the corner
We can meet up right where we left off
If there's nothing else round the corner
If there's nothing else round the corner
If there's nothing else round the corner

If there's nothing else right here
If there's nothing left to give
We can meet up right where we left
If there's nothing else round the corner
If there's nothing else round the corner

Throw t off me
Show skin, surely
Thought we were evergreen
Now we're just on fire
I won't know free
Til he holds me
And I don't feel pleasure
When I'm up inside

Throw t off me
Show skin, surely
Thought we were evergreen
Now we're just on fire
I won't know free
Til he holds me
And I don't feel pleasure
When I'm up inside

"Genesis"

Basically an atheist, he's all that I believe in right now
The torch is out, I'm begging for the torture now
Half a stoner, practically an adolescent, insert here industrial sounds

Ever since Jerusalem, had a change of heart
You went back to genesis, found God
But not the one you were looking for
Not the one you were looking for
Not the one you were looking for
Am I the one you were looking for
Am I the one you were looking for

Erasing my intolerance to nicotine and you are quite the opposite
Lace it with what you offered me
Cured from the ivy
Roses on loan (seeing double)
Laid on a throne (peripheral)
This is on the radio, hold me tightly
Say your name out loud
That's faith, that's fate (now)

Ever since Jerusalem, had a change of heart
You went back to genesis, found God
But not the one you were looking for
Not the one you were looking for
Not the one you were looking for
Am I the one you were looking for
Am I the one you were looking for

Heavens in the room
Heavens in the room
Heavens in the room
Heavens in the room
Heavens in the room
Heavens in the room
Heaven made the rules

Heavens in the room
Heavens in the room (shine like light)
Heavens in the room
Heavens in the room (shine like light)
Heavens in the room
Heavens in the room
Heaven made the rules

"Backseat"

Sometimes I watch you drive from the backseat and I let you have your way
Switch sides with me, I got you on the way home
And you can play the radio
Reminding me to tell you something
I can't remember what you said
See you looking out the window
I wonder what you think about

You would comb my hair
Never let me down
Always let the tears run out
I wonder what you'd tell me now
Cause I need a friend who could have my back
When the lightning comes and I catch on fire

Return to where we were on the weekend
And you pull up to my yard
From paper to vaporize, let the smoke out
I can feel it in my heart
Imagine if it wasn't magic
My back is on the bedroom floor
I like it when I hear you breathing
Reminds me that I'm not alone

All my idols dead, when I have no one
I look to you for advice
What to do with my life
Half of who I am isn't all my fault
So it feels good knowing that I got somebody

"Brother"

Speeding with no hesitation
Crushed up the pills that you had
Just like the matches you're burning
To see if it all falls down

Why do you leave yourself
Leave yourself
Leave yourself alone
Why don't you ask for help when you're needing someone
I'm giving everything to get to you
I'm knocking at your door
I'm knocking at your door
If only you would let me in

Brother you can lay your head
You can lay your head on my shoulder
I see that you, you try your best to be someone that you don't want to

You know, you know you can call on me
You know, you know

Why do you leave yourself
Leave yourself
Leave yourself alone
Why don't you ask for help when you're needing someone
I'm giving everything to get to you
I'm knocking at your door
I'm knocking at your door
If only you would let me in

You are so quiet
I wonder if you cry yourself to sleep
There is a light within your eyes
If only you could see

"Casino"

I'm wide awake in the lobby of a hotel casino
An advertise of somewhere I wanted to be
The oxygen was choking like death grips around me
I even thought I couldn't be sadder than that,
I am

Hood on, hand in my pocket, walk away
Hood on, hand in my pocket, walk away

Love me to death or don't give me anything
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Love me to death or don't give me anything
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Love me to death or don't give me anything

The elderly was playing a version of your song
I asked them if they could play anything else,
But they don't
I sing along and laugh just in case of the opposite
Everything was blurry so I couldn't see
Thankfully

Hood on, hand in my pocket, walk away
(Walk away)
Hood on, hand in my pocket, walk away

Love me to death or don't give me anything
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Love me to death or don't give me anything
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Love me to death or don't give me anything

Come around like the moon, sun, most the time you're on my mind
Come around like the moon, sun, most the time you're on my mind
Come around like the moon, sun, most the time you're on my mind
Come around like the moon, sun, most the time you're on my mind

Hood on, hand in my pocket, walk away
(Walk away)
Hood on, hand in my pocket, walk away

Love me to death or don't give me anything
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Love me to death or don't give me anything
Ah yeah, ah yeah
Love me to death or don't give me anything

When I see a call from plano then I know that I'll ignore for reasons that you - in my mind it's better to fantasize, so I'll buy a pack and sit back and look at the sky

"Shimmer"

Father, father
Come home, come home, come home
Come home, come home, come home
My arms are here
My arms are here for you

You took me fishing when I was 8
Went to june lake, came face to face
With my future and a deer in the woods
Those times, so gone, so good
Those times, so gone, so good, so good

I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that

Father, father
Come home, come home, come home
Come home, come home, come home
My arms are here
My arms are here for you

I thought I was separate from nature
Now I know otherwise
I might live long enough to see myself
Dying without a child, I
I see myself in you, I
I see myself in you

I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that

I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that

I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel
I never want to feel like that
I never want to feel like that

I'll wake up, I'm sorry, memorize, apologize
It's alright, yeah, that's how this goes
I read that somewhere
Something you wrote me years ago

If you look deeper
See my face through the speakers
"It's magic", that's what you said
Remember when I left you crying years ago

"Dreaming Of David"

Dreaming of David
It's all in his honor
I don't want to die a sudden death
It's making me wonder
It's making me feel like I can dance on you
(I heard him say)
Tell me your problems, honor
(I'm trying, I'm trying hard)

How dare you cross my mind that way

Making me feel lots of things I can't explain
Making me feel lots of things I can't explain
Making me feel lots of things
I just want you to hold me forever

We're at an altar
(My feet are tired from running so fast)
I'm in your strong arms
The beauty of it all, super real
I stay on your good side
Maybe someday we'll have it all
(Defeat in my head, I heard him say)
Stuck on eternal honor
(I'm trying, I'm trying hard)

How dare you cross my mind that way

Making me feel lots of things I can't explain
Making me feel lots of things I can't explain (it's all in my head)
Making me feel lots of things
I just want you to hold me forever

I'll keep a copy of the pictures
Remembrance of my sisters
I can see the light now
I'm overgrown but not so broken
So now I'll say what I have spoken
I command the choir
It's unrequited, I don't fight it
No blood on my hands
No blood on my hands
No blood on my hands
That's how I like it
That's how I like it

"Ribbons"

It took all of California
To remind you why you came
Monterey to Camarillo
Camarillo to L.A.
Driving with the headlights off
Ribbons running down your face
'Cause you've never known love like that
So you dance the night away
And the night bleeds into Sunday morning
And it feels like it's going your way
Then all the lights in the bar turn on
And you remember why you came

And suddenly you're sober
And you stay up for the sunrise like a songbird
Moonwalking like a creep just
Just happy to, to be here at all
And suddenly you're older
Spinning the turnstile over and over
Who's gonna hold you while you sleep, well
It's brave to be nothing to no one at all

It's out of my hands
What can I tell you
I'm not losing it
I'm just having a laugh
Counting my paces
I'm making faces
At the one who stares at me
At the end of the glass

"Bruises Off The Peach"

Something's missing
And that's alright, I promise
I'm gonna give it until August
I'm not a Christian
I'm careless like a comet
You couldn't have me if you wanted

I cut all the bruises off the peach
Not as beautiful, but still as sweet
There you go again with all your needs
What did it ever have to do with me?
What did it ever have to do with me?

Staring at the ceiling now, a million hours pass
Love will always last
Love will always hold me down
What is it all about? Oh
Staring at the ceiling now, a million hours pass
Love will always last
Love will always hold me down
What is it all about? Oh

I cut all the bruises off the peach
Not as beautiful, but still as sweet
There you go again with all your needs
What did it ever have to do with me?
What did it ever have to do with me?
I cut all the bruises off the peach
Not as beautiful, but still as sweet
There you go again with all your needs
What did it ever have to do with me?
What did it ever have to do with me?

"Cinnamon Bread"

Infinite Jest and cinnamon bread
Why don't you make yourself at home?
When you open up, you close me in
And cut me to the bone
Close as a kiss on the lip
To the southern tip
Until you're red in the face
Now you've got nothing to say
Now you've got nothing to say
Spring, summer, fall
You were standing tall
Winning all of your basketball games

You galloped on the piano keys
Like a Liberace fool
You hummed a little out of tune
And somehow you sounded cool
I can't lie
May, June, July
I was a good guy
Then you came over that day
Now I've got nothing to say
I must've left open the gate
Now the dog is running away

If this goes on forever
Could you ever keep me safe?
Like all the men you've loved
The women you've loved
You tell me we're in this together
When I know it's not the case
'Cause all the men you've loved
The women you've loved
They all got something to say
They all got something to say
It couldn't keep me away

"Andromeda"

Sleeping to reality television
It was an Arizona pleasure with the wind
That night I had a dream you took me dancing
It was 92 degrees at 2 am

Twirling my hair
It's not everything I wished for
But I didn't care
I just liked having you there

What stops me from sending the call?
In a midnight paranoia, hey
That's love after all, isn't it?
What stops me from spending it all?
Spinning out, Andromeda
Watching Jupiter come back around again

If the family is happy
Let 'em laugh, let 'em have their fun
My sister's raising a baby
In the house where my mother grew up
If I would've known you're out in the cold
Why did I go, why didn't I stay?
Now, all that we've had is all that we have

There's a wound in the past
Pouring out the only bottle
Of milk for the cats
A dozen at that

What stops me from sending the call?
In a midnight paranoia, hey
That's love after all, isn't it?
What stops me from spending it all?
Spinning out, Andromeda
Watching Jupiter come back around again

"Bright Red"

No cry, no pain
Close up, open
Rainbow overhead
Strawberry, bright red
Taste is the sweetest
Honey dripping
A circle won't end
Some lose, some win

All these satellites litter the sky
Not even we can see past these material things
Not even when it's free, yeah
There's a million ways that this could end
And no horizon's ever promised
So, while I hold my baby in my arms
I'll count on God to wake us up by sunrise

Good luck, good day
Glitter on my face
Screaming your name
Laughter everlasting
True love will last
Speed up, but don't crash

Driving up the 2 for better views and coastal weather
And I looked up at you, saw the flowers, I remember

All these satellites litter the sky
Not even we can see past these material things
Not even when it's free, yeah
There's a million ways that this could end
And no horizon's ever promised
So, while I hold my baby in my arms
I'll count on God to wake us up by sunrise

"Hunter"

Followed the trail
The hunter proposed me a left
Frost covered meadows
Coats in their cardinal red
I swallowed the beer
While a man who was holding a deer made his amends
And that's when I realized
All this time that I've been living in my head

All roads lead to where I started
Every sunrise follows darkness
Every single mountain has its peak (Ooh, ooh)

Horse in the stable
Of course it was raining out today
Thunder and lightning
Frightened the lone mare away
I've adapted to run
When it gets tough, I disappear
Warm blooded and wild
I can sense the changes in the air

Cedar trees fall in the forest
Echoing the cardinal chorus
Every moving river has its turn (Ooh, ooh)

Sandpaper pastures
Quilted in calico cream
You woke from a nightmare
Your nightmare woke me up from a dream
The stars are your burden
The lights and the curtains burned to the ground
But now and again I'll put on your movie
When no one is around

Didn't shoot, but yeah you thought it
Kissing clay from Caleb's cartridge
Every wildflower comes from dirt (Ooh, ooh)

Touting the keys
To a '73 Chevy truck
If I sold everything, bargain with a wink
It might be enough
The carnival phonies, the clowns and the ponies
Pour into town
I'm not seeking a shelter, but I'll be gone for a while
And I don't wanna be found

"White Teeth"

I'm not your brother
I can't take care of you
I've purchased furniture in place of you
I'd have you over
Jenni's in the other room
But she'll be leaving in the afternoon

Clear water, still water, we could both wade
Clear water, still water, what's our code name?
Stay close or go far, I'll still wait

Old summer rain
Some lefts, some rights
So strange
In the porch light
Handprint on a windowpane
Like white teeth to a red wine stain
Some left, but the right ones stay
A good end to a Saturday

I walk to Bel Air
I walk until I'm new
I call up Jacob for something to do
You're somewhere out there
Leaving me little clues
Chewing licorice in your cowboy blues

Clear water, still water, we could both wade
Clear water, still water, what's our code name?
Stay close or go far, I'll still wait

Old summer rain
Some lefts, some rights
So strange
In the porch light
Handprint on a windowpane
Like white teeth to a red wine stain
Some left, but the right ones stay
Went broke, but the band got paid

If I could stretch these hours into a lifetime
Well, I would stretch these arms
And do it at the right time, I would
In spirit you were there, well maybe next time
Careful with your words, won't let it slide by
Candy in your cheek, sweet goodbye

Old summer rain (Old summer rain)
Some lefts, some rights
So strange (Yeah)
In the porch light
Handprint on a windowpane
Like white teeth to a red wine stain
Some left, but the right ones stay
A good end to a Saturday

"Multiple Endings"

So you pull me apart
And now you're making me answer
But I don't answer to you
I went through days
With multiple endings
Just to get through
So now you're nervous
Come out with the crying
Boy, it's hard being you
We looked at the TV
For less than an hour
Boy, it's hard being used

You were right
Texas is hot at night
Thank God for the wind
There's a storm in sight
I didn't offer a room
I gave you a bed
Was all that a dream?
Was it all in my head? Mmm

And still even then, I always write you back
Yeah, I did you wrong, you did me ten times back
Blood washes away, even I know that
I stood from the canyon looking out to see
The marine layer over Santa Monica sea
Someday I'll disappear like the air underneath

You were right
Texas is hot at night
Thank God for the wind
There's a storm in sight
I didn't offer a room
I gave you a bed
Was all that a dream?
Was it all in my head? Oh

"Little Faith"

A brown paper bag
With 30-something tablets
To clean up my act
To keep it real candid
I sat down at the table
Took a pill from the palm of an angel
They say that it's good
It could save you

I don't think I want to do this
But I can't give into my old ways
So go on, honey
Hallelujah for a little faith

The laundry is turning
And every day I've been hurting
I'm always too late or too early
Never on time
The plant has been dying
I've watered it twice, I've been trying
Born green, lived yellow, then drying
I try once in awhile

I don't want to be a killer
But it died right there that day
So go on, sunny
Hallelujah for a little faith
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take?
Have a little faith
Have a little faith

Going through your jewelry
I smile, but I know you see through me
You knew who I was 'fore I knew me
On the very first day
Now I know what you're onto
You were just looking for someone to talk to
A beautiful life to belong to
Now you're getting your way

I didn't think I'd want to be here
But something told me I should stay
So go on, mother
Hallelujah for a little faith
What's it gonna take?
What's it gonna take?
Have a little faith
Have a little faith

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

"By My Side"

Honestly, I don't know where I'll be
In a couple years, hope I fulfil my fantasy
There'll be no tears, someday it'll work out
Work out for me
I know it's gettin' closer
Close to see

If I start to be myself
Every single day of my life
Something tells me that I'm gonna be alright
If I ever lose myself
All my friends will be by my side
Nothing's ever gonna change the way I feel

If you got a minute, if you got a minute
Promise that I won't change
If you ever want it, if you ever want it
Call out my name

When I was younger
I would call on my brother
Now he calls on me for a little bit of sunshine
Some peace of mind
My only advice
Never think twice
Follow you heart
If you get lost, go back to the start
Woo-woo-woo, ooh, ooh

If I start to be myself
Every single day of my life
Something tells me that I'm gonna be alright
If I ever lose myself
All my friends will be by my side
Nothing's ever gonna change the way I feel

If you got a minute, if you got a minute
Promise that I won't change
If you ever want it, if you ever want it
Call out my name

When I was younger
I would call on my brother
Now he calls on me for a little bit of sunshine
Some peace of mind
My only advice
Never think twice
Follow you heart
If you get lost, go back to the start
Woo-woo-woo, ooh, ooh

If I start to be myself
Every single day of my life
Something tells me that I'm gonna be alright
If I ever lose myself
All my friends will be by my side
Nothing's ever gonna change the way I feel

If you got a minute, if you got a minute
Promise that I won't change
If you ever want it, if you ever want it
Call out my name

"Dark Circles, A Performance"

Match me, when I tell you things that no one knows about me
What keeps me up at night
What keeps you in my life

I left you at time when you were trying to get your life back
I'll probably end up somewhere in the lime light
What keeps me up at night
What keeps you in my life

I swear, If I could give you up
I would erase you
Get you out of my mind (he's all I think about)
Let you go somewhere else (try to let go but I can't help)

Alone in the clothes you let me borrow
When the rain came
I'm laying down and I can't help but daydream
Who do you idolize now
Do you ever think about me

Think about me
Think about me
Think about me

I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me

I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me

I think forever is too long
What does it mean to be loyal
I put your jacket on
To make me feel important

I think forever is too long
What does it mean to be loyal
I put your jacket on
To make me feel important

Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover
Never wanna be someone else's lover

I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me

I don't have the bones to be free
I believe in love when he
Confesses himself inside me

"Memories & Photographs"

Took my heart, left your sweater 
I thought time would make it better 
I'm still talking to the pain 
I thought that I could be forgiving 
With all the letters I have written 
But the past is hard to change 

You left me at the table  
Thinking 'bout the past 
Now all I have are memories and photographs 

I miss our careful conversations 
The simple expectations 
It was never hard for us 
But lately all I can remember 
Is that phone call in December 
Saying that I'm not enough 

Now I'm sitting here at the table 
Thinking 'bout the past 
Now all I have are memories and photographs 
Memories and photographs 

Where oh where oh did you run and hide? 
Why oh why oh did you say goodbye? 
Is it really goodbye? 
Is it really goodbye? 

Now I'm sitting here at the table 
Thinking about the past 
Now all I have are memories and photographs 
Memories and photographs 
Memories and photographs

"Nobody Like You"

I knew right from the start that you would have my heart 
So now it's here in your hands 
You got me in a daze so caught up in your ways 
I can't believe what I am

And sometimes you drive me crazy know that it don't faze me 
Cause baby I ain't going nowhere

I just wanna love you place no one above you 
Ain't nobody do it like you
I just can't control it girl just let me show it 
Ain't nobody do it like you

There's something bout your style the way you walk, the way you smile 
Keeps me coming right back to you (yeah)
No make-up I don't care don't have to do your hair 
You're still the best in the room

So forget them other girls there ain't nothing in this world
That keeps me coming right back to you

I'm just gonna love you place no one above you 
Ain't nobody do it like you
I just can't control it girl just let me show it
Ain't nobody do it like you

Da da da da daa da da da da daa I - (yeah) Uumm yeah

I just wanna love you place no one above you
Ain't nobody do it like you 
I just can't control it girl just let me show it 
Ain't nobody do it like you

I just wanna love you place no one above you
Ain't nobody do it like you yeah

"Passion"

Broken politicks, wonder if
You can change my mind
And move to the flicker of the life
Say goodbye, to the high

I'm shutting out all the messages
Breaking down again
Breaking from your grip
Do you miss me?
Yeah, Imma make you sense
I don't know

At least I tried
At least I tried
I'm getting tired
Of running
And wearing this broken crown

I'll fight for it
I swear I'll never lose the passion
When I'm down
Can I call out your name?
I swear I'll never lose the passion
When I'm down
Can I call out your name?

I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry
Just wanna take what's mine
And do it all in time

Remember who we are
Remember who we are
When we are apart
This love is dark

I'll fight for it
I swear I'll never lose the passion
When I'm down
Can I call out your name?
I swear I'll never lose the passion
When I'm down
Can I call out your name?

I don't wanna cry
Myself to sleep
I stay awake
So I can dream
Of you and I
And everything
Come back to me
Come back to me

I'll fight for it
I swear I'll never lose to passion
When I'm down
Can I call out your name?
I swear I'll never lose the passion
When I'm down
Can I call out your name?

When I'm down?
Can I call out your name
