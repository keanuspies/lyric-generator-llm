"Same Girl"

I'm still wearing my blue jeans
No I don't know what you mean
I'm still the same girl
Picking daisies in the field
I believe in what I feel
I've always been the same girl

Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun

I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl

I still live in one small town
But always love to move around
I've always been the same girl
Still keep diaries that say
Where I was and did that day
I've always been the same girl

Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun

I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl

Some days will change your life
Yeah this could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking...

I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl

Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl

"Baby Blue"

Small town, big blue sky
Little blonde baby with starry blue eyes
Growing up fast didn't slow her down
American child in her baby blue gown
Her bedroom was pink 'til she turned three
She liked the feel of her baby blue sheets
Neighbors stared at the one horse lie
Of a little girl with blue on her mind

Thought of green when she was feeling blue
American child in her baby blue boots
She was an archangel, sweet danger
Living and loving and singing her song
Knew what she wanted and knew what she loved
And she loved, she loved baby blue

Eighteen, small scene
Here, our love was a beauty unseen
Living life young, she'd never get bored
When Hank came around in his beat-up Ford
Prom night came with a blue corsage
Had the car waxed at Ben's Garage
Told her he loved her and meant nothing less
To a baby-blonde girl in a baby blue dress
He reached over and kissed her hand
Five years later came a brand-new, baby blue wedding band

She was a romantic, taking chances
Living and loving and singing her song
Knew what she wanted and knew what she loved
And she loved, she loved baby blue

Married two years, Hank was an engineer
She would just stay home, soon-to-be mom
Every night they'd sit on the front porch
Waiting for the brand-new, brand-new baby to come

She was a newcomer, lullaby hummer
Counting her blessings and living for love
Knew what she wanted and knew what she loved
And she loved her new baby, Blue
Her brand-new baby, Blue
Her newborn baby, Blue

Small town, big blue sky
Little blonde baby with starry blue eyes

"Never Fade"

I think you fell off of your cloud today
You didn't see it coming or did you
You tried to please everybody
But the sweet breeze swept you away

The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think you're all alone in this place
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby

Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade

Hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you
Somebody blows your candle out
You wore a mask, now that's broken too
Everybody else was everything to you

The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think everybody wants a fight
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby

Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade

I think you fell out of the sky today
I think you know it's true
You've seen the world, now all you see is me
Tell me now baby what are you gonna do

Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Never fade

"Fire"

Asking you questions is like asking for lies
"Won't happen no more," yeah, I've heard that before
Running 'round in circles isn't my game
I tried to make it work but I end up getting burned

By the fire
Leading on life with a tear in my eye
And I know
Oh, I should've learned, but I guess it's my turn
To try to put out your fire

Giving you answers to my trivial heart
It's hard to break the chains
That I can't pull apart
Running 'round in circles ain't nobody's game
I tried to make it work but I keep on getting hurt

By the fire
Leading on life with a tear in my eye
And I know
Oh, I should've learned, but I guess it's my turn
To try to put out your fire

Your flames, oh they're putting me out
The smoke, can't see my way out
The heat, the heartaches
The fog, the blindness
The eyes of cries and shattered lies

Trying to put out your fire
Leading on life with a tear in my eye
And I know
Oh, I should've learned, but I guess it's my turn
To try to put out your fire

Oh, I should've learned, but I guess it's my turn
To try to put out your fire

"Mary Jo"

There's a little green house off a gravel road
'Bout a mile from Bobby Freeman's farm
Mary Jo runs her own little flower shop
Courtesy of the old red barn
My mama's mama's lifelong friend, Jo
Didn't like the people of town
Four kids and wildflowers and calla lilies
Jo'd rather have them around

Got me a letter, said
"You gotta come home
I'm feeling a little bit low
It's lilac season and I need some help
Keeping my garden grown
Signed, Mary Jo"

So many questions answered
When I spent that summer with Jo
Lavender pillows and weeping willows
Things I would never have known
'Til Mary Jo

We collected bouquets and made lemonade
Mixed rose water perfume
Jo started giving and I started living
Under the pale blue moon
Sang to Jo's records and Sweet Home Kentucky
Watching her garden grow
Says I'm smart and always was lucky
Now I'll never really know
XO, Mary Jo

So many questions answered
When I spent that summer with Jo
Lavender pillows and weeping willows
Things I would never have known
'Til Mary Jo

Summer started packing its bags
And Mary Jo had something on her mind
Cleared her throat and swallowed real hard
And said "My voice seems to be in a bind
But when I wrote that letter I was really sick
The doctor said I was gonna go
Then you came home and it seems to be gone
You made something in that garden grow
But we'll never know"
Said Mary Jo

So many questions answered
When I spent that summer with Jo
Lavender pillows and weeping willows
Things I would never have known
'Til Mary Jo

"My Turn To Be Me"

Something about me didn't fit into your perfect world
I bet the bluegrass stained your smile
You should use a darker color when you write on the wall
I haven't read it a thousand times

Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

You liked the face but you had to replace me
Inside I saw the walls of me go down
You can take the girl away from
Cowboy hats and steel guitars
She'll still sing the same old songs

Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

Turned on that radio
Hey that's when I realized
It wasn't our song, it was yours
And in conversation baby I was decoration
Now I deserve a little bit more than

To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

It's my turn to be me

"Kid In The Crowd"
(unreleased)

Little girl, she looks around
She's standing in the open ground
Looks up at the girl alone
Singing through the microphone
Girl gives girl a little smile
And just one wink that could have run a mile
But life is full of empty days
But the little girl said, "I'm gonna be like that someday"

I remember the eyes
Of the kid in the crowd who cut me down to size
And realizing is crying out loud
For every kid on stage, there is a kid in the crowd

Girl on stage holds her hand
Backed up by a country band
Looking down with eyes of grace
Looked upon that young girl's face
And when she smiled at that 8 year old
Endless thoughts that can never be told
Wiped away those empty days
And the little girl said, "I'm gonna be like that someday"

I remember the eyes
Of the kid in the crowd who cut me down to size
And realizing is crying out loud
For every kid on stage, there is a kid in the crowd

Answered why's are like moonlit skies
And loving eyes are like fireflies
One of these, they really can be
But that little girl, that little girl was me

I remember the time
I was a kid in the crowd
With a dream in my eyes
Realizing is crying out loud
There was a kid on stage, I was a kid in the crowd

I'm still the kid in the crowd

"I Used To Fly"

I... I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the sky
I wanna tell you why
But somehow I know I
Would break down and cry

I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

You... you know I would die
Before I let them see me
See me cry
Please don't leave tonight
Oh let me down slowly
Show me a light

I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

Oh let me think I'm strong
Please don't bring me down
I need you tonight

I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

I... I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the sky

"Lucky You"

There's a little girl in this little town
With a little too much heart to go around.
"Live forever. Never say never.
You can do better," that's what she says.

Her mama named her Lucky on a starlit night.
A rabbit foot in her pocket. She dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different,
And yet she's the same.
And she says, "Do do do..."
Lucky you, lucky you

She sings her little song. She walks along
A little pathway headed for the skies.
Left to travels, lives they unravel.
"Mind over matter," that's what she says.

Her mama named her Lucky on a starlit night.
A rabbit foot in her pocket. She dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different,
And yet she's the same.
And she says, "Do do do..."
Lucky you, lucky you, lucky you.

Maybe she'll sing you "Do do do do."
Maybe she'll bring you up to the skies.
Honey, she'll love you. Funny how some view
Angels above you ain't so far away.

Her mama named her Lucky on a starlit night.
A rabbit foot in her pocket. She dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different,
And yet she's the same.
And she says, "Do do do..."
Lucky you, lucky you.

"Point Of View"

Time is passing slowly for the eight-year-old next door
But mama's watch is ticking off the wall
Jillian and Bobby think that they're a perfect pair
The girls could say he's just a bit too tall

You don't have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say, "I love you"
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view

He hated pink, so she threw out her favorite clothes
His NFL was turned to TLC
Baby's got an attitude and thinks they just don't know
But they all do and wish that she could see

You don't have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say, "I love you"
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view

In the least, a masterpiece
Depends on one's opinion
Worst of all, they never call
But don't think that they weren't wishing

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say, "I love you"
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view
It's all in your point of view
Point of view
It's all in your point of view

"Why Do You Tell Me?"

I tried to impress you
It didn't matter to you, I don't matter to you
But you tried to make me think I was crazy
"Put all these dreams on hold," that's what I was being told

Tugging at my heartstrings
Every little part sings, "Ooh, you're gonna bring me down"
But I don't need to know what you don't need to show
Well, I don't wanna go down

So why do you tell me you believe in heaven?
Then you get me where it hurts just when I turned around
And I try to fight this hole inside, it's tearing me to pieces
Why do you tell me you believe in me?
You believe in me

It hurts so bad to hear you say it
Did I really go so wrong? Tell me now, what's going on?
Hearts fall like a broken angel
Did you mean to break me down every time I turn around?

Tugging at my heartstrings
Every little part sings, "Ooh, you're gonna bring me down"
But I don't need to know what you don't need to show
Well, I don't wanna go down

So why do you tell me you believe in heaven?
Then you get me where it hurts just when I turned around
And I try to fight this hole inside, it's tearing me to pieces
Why do you tell me you believe in me?
You believe in me

Why do you tell me you believe in heaven?
Then you get me where it hurts just when I turned around
And I try to fight this hole inside, it's tearing me to pieces
Why do you tell me you believe in me?
You believe in me

"Houston Rodeo"

Shooting star flew across the sky
A light turned on in the barn
Nine-year-old boy and a stream of joy
Just sitting there trying to keep warm
A soon-to-be-mama quarter horse
Looked up at the sky
Then came a foal and he set a goal
Then tears came to his eyes

Little boys, they dream big dreams
And some just might come true
And if he rides, that young foal's strides
Are bound to take him to...
He's going to the Houston rodeo
Ooh, on that horse you ride
Put on his daddy's cowboy hat
With a little Texas town pride
Houston rodeo

Every night, that boy would ride on that horse in moonlight
Black and white, he was a bumpy ride
But that boy was gonna make him right
Through heat and snow, they rode and rode
Soon they were best friends
By light of dawn, they were always gone
Following trails that never end

Little boys, they dream big dreams
And some, they have to come true
If he rides that yearling's strides
Are bound to take him to...
He's going to the Houston rodeo
Ooh, on that horse he'll ride
Put on his daddy's cowboy hat
With a little Texas town pride
Houston rodeo

And when he was a teen
Made it to the rodeo
And as the gate released
He took on the Houston rodeo

He's going to the Houston rodeo
Ooh, on that horse he'll ride
Put on his daddy's cowboy hat
With a little Texas town pride
Oh, that boy, he's gonna ride
Houston rodeo, oh

"A Little More Like You"

Think of something you can't touch
I see angels start to blush when they look at you
When I went to my guitar to write this song I fell apart
'Cause I'm counting every second like time in a jar
And these words are just words, that's not what you are

Would you rather me say what I really mean?
I love you but it won't get through if I try too hard
Honestly, what I really mean
Is I want to be a little more like you

Drag a pen across a page
Take a look at what you made- you made me, me
Turn around and watch me live
Learn again that to forgive is to believe
And to thank is to bless
I'm drawing the curtain, 'cause now I've been blessed

Would you rather me say what I really mean?
I love you but it won't get through if I try too hard
Honestly, what I really mean
Is I want to be a little more like you
Yeah, I want to be a little more like you

There seems to be something I can't see
That keeps you from falling apart
It's safe to say you're far away
And anybody else, oh anybody else

Would you rather me say what I really mean?
I love you but it won't get through if I try too hard
Honestly, what I really mean
Is I want to be a little more like you
Yeah, I want to be a little more like you, like you
Yeah, I want to be a little more like you

"One-Sided Goodbye"

You said it, then you walked away
But you don't know what goodbye means
Baby, I'm sorry, didn't ever mean to hurt you
Please, save it for a rainy day
'Cause you don't know what crying's like
When the world keeps spinning and I can't take it alone

And you're so different from all those other people
I thought it would be different with you
But I can't see you crying without me
So I guess I'll have to make it through without you

I wasn't ready for your one-sided goodbye
You walked around like you loved me, I
Notice how the world tries to mask that word
"See you later," "gotta go," oh no

I don't care what they would say
If you love someone don't let them go
Do you believe in taking chances?
So tell me why you walked away
'Cause I can't see through your heart
Everything's hazy and you're making me crazy for you

Well, I thought you were different
Maybe I'm crazy
I know I wasn't numb with you
But I can't hear you crying without me
So I guess I'll have to make it through without you

I wasn't ready for your one-sided goodbye
You walked around like you loved me, I
Notice how the world tries to mask that word
"See you later," "gotta go"

Why can't you see, why can't you be
Madly in love with me, too?
Past emotion, but you've already spoken
I guess I'll have to make it through without you

I wasn't ready for your one-sided goodbye
You walked around like you loved me, I
Notice how the world tries to mask that word
"See you later," "gotta go", oh no

"Ride On"

Think of an angel tonight
Think of something, my baby
'Cause everyone needs something to believe in
Somebody's watching you tonight
You'll never know it now
But you're that one that they can't live, live without

As far as we know, we only live once
And this could be your masterpiece
And you never know what lies ahead
Life is made of falling down and getting back up again
The sun falls down every night and gets back up at dawn
Ride on

And think of beginnings tonight
Believe in so much more than you can ever try to imagine
And look at the sunset tonight
Believe in something that's greater than your tiny world
Or broken heart

As far as we know, we only live once
And this could be your masterpiece
And you never know what lies ahead
Life is made of falling down and getting back up again
The sun falls down every night and gets back up at dawn
Ride on

Some people waste it all looking for heaven
Maybe there's heaven, but what if
What if this is that heaven we're waiting for?
Buddy, you don't know
You'll never know

Baby, I'm watching you tonight
You never saw it before
But you're that one that I can't live without
And I could go with you tonight
But love is a one-sided street
Don't know and I'm not brave enough to find out

As far as we know, we only live once
And this could be your masterpiece
And you never know what lies ahead
Life is made of falling down and getting back up again
The sun falls down every night and gets back up at dawn
Ride on

"Smokey Black Nights"

Let's watch
The tide chase
The waves
Onto the sand
I wonder
If a broken heart
Can feel the warmth
On my hand
And I wonder
What a piece
Of driftwood
Has seen all through
His lifetime
Let's walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights

I've seen
A million things
Spoke a million words
Now I only want
To speak to you

Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

Still through
The haze
I can make out
Constellations
I'll make one
Of you and me
As we sit
In the sand
And I saw
That sunset gleaming
As my eyes went wild
Let's walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights

I've played
A thousand songs
Sang a thousand words
Now I only want
To sing to you

Waited on a wire
Starin' at the fire
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

I've walked
A thousand miles
Smiled
A thousand smiles
Now I only smile
When I'm with you

Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing
I'd rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

So walk with me
As the sweet
Wind dances
I'll write a song
For you and me
On the
Smokey black nights

"Halfway To Texas"

When I got mad at you, I always said I'd move to Texas
As a crazy little girl, what was I supposed to do?
And I'm still crazy and I guess I haven't gotten much better
You're getting complicated, so I'll hit the road for someplace new

Well, I'm halfway to Texas, enjoying this roadside view
Just clearing my head, trying not to think back on you
And I'm trying to be strong
Maybe this whole thing is wrong
So I'll focus on the winding road leading to Texas

The wind in my hair is reminding me of the way you held me
Back home is far, I won't give up just yet
Right now you'll probably call wondering what I'm doing
And a voice in the wind will tell you I'm a long time gone

Well, I'm halfway to Texas, kinda thinking back on you
There's a thought in my head saying my best option is you
And I hope I can stay strong
I'm starting to think this is wrong
I'll just focus on the winding road leading to Texas

I've stopped the car, all I can think of is you
Maybe you were right, now I know how much I love you

I'm halfway to Texas, I'm turned around 'cause I love you
I'm coming back to you darling, wanna spend my life with you
And I know I have this wrong
I've stayed away from you this long
I'm taking you with me next time I go to Texas
I'm taking you with me next time I go to Texas

"Beautiful Days"

A moment just passed
And I know it's hard to believe, but it could have been something
And I could have smiled your way
Maybe you'd see there's something in me that loves you

I've been waiting for that sweet second that never was
That period of time, that vision in my mind
That feeling of melting into you
The time I could've lived it, but I didn't take a chance
Keep it on your mind, you'll always like to dance
Living like you love it, you love it just the same

'Cause life is made up of those moments
That you let slip away
Life is just beautiful, beautiful days

What if I hadn't turned around?
And I'd kept walking, and looked through your starry eyes
Well, I would have known it then
Instead of just waiting to find out if I love you

I've been waiting for that sweet second that never was
That period of time, that vision in my mind
That feeling of melting into you
The time I could've lived it, but I didn't take the chance
Keep it on your mind, you'll always like to dance
Living like you love it, you love it just the same

Well, life is made up of those moments
That you let slip away
Life is just beautiful, beautiful days

Will you love me when tomorrow comes?
It's just another Monday, baby won't you come with me?
And see me in a different light?
I could be your angel if you want to take a chance
Baby, if you knew me, you'd know I'll always dance
Love me like you need me, and I'll be yours, true

All that matters to me is you, babe
You're never gonna slip away
Life is just beautiful, life is just beautiful
Life is just beautiful, beautiful days
Beautiful days
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful days

"Your Heart's Somewhere Else"

I used to know everything you were thinking
But now I just know you're thinking 'bout someone else but me
I count the days, I count the words you say
I need to know you're alive and hoping I'll be by your side
Can't help but think that I'm driving you away
Don't let me think it's real, don't make me think you'll stay

I don't know if you're with me
I know you're standing here
I always turn around just to know you're there
And I deny it
Here, I'm crying
It's hard to tell myself
Your heart's somewhere else

I see you now, I don't see happiness
Don't want to hold you back but I still want you for myself
You look around, do you like the things you see?
You're in a cage but I can't stand to let you free
I can't help but know that I'm driving you away
Don't let me think your love won't someday go away

I don't know if you're with me
I know you're standing here
Sometimes I turn around to see if you're still there
And I deny it
Here inside, I'm crying
It's hard to tell myself
Your heart's somewhere else

I never thought your eyes would lose their happiness
I know the longer you stay, the more you love me less

I don't know if you're with me
I know you're standing here
I always turn around just to know you're there
And I deny it
I am crying
It's hard to tell myself
Your heart's somewhere else
Your heart's somewhere else
Your heart's somewhere else

"Tim McGraw"

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On back roads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:

"When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place"

When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

Oh, think of me
Mmmm

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"

"Picture To Burn"

State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine I'll tell mine that you're gay!
By the way...

I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned
You're just another picture to burn!

There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned
You're just another picture to burn!

And if you're missing me
You'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health...

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that...

Stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned
You're just another picture to burn!

Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn...

"Teardrops On My Guitar"

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do

So, I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see

"A Place In This World"

I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's OK

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Oh I'm just a girl
Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh
Oh I'm just a girl

"Cold As You"

You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you, died for you

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

"The Outside"

I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason
I know I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go

I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
And I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late. So you see

You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too late to do anything

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
And I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh, yeah

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
And I can still see you
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
And I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

"Tied Together With A Smile"

Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true 'cause I know you

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain

Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

You're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone
Goodbye, baby
With a smile, baby, baby

"Stay Beautiful"

Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
That watch him as he's walking home
Saying, "Does he know?"
Will you ever know?

You're beautiful
Every little piece love
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say, hey, by the way

You're beautiful
Every little piece love
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold
At least you'll know

You're beautiful
Every little piece love
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh, but if it don't
Will you stay
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
La la la
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
Na, na, na, na, na

"Should've Said No"

It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you feels wrong

You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."

You should've said "No", you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd
Get back to me (get back to me).
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."

You should've said "No", you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd,
Get back to me (get back to me).
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me

I can't resist
Before you go, tell me this:
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?

No... no, no, no...

You should've said "No", you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd,
Get back to me (get back to me).
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me

"Mary's Song (Oh My My My)"

She said, I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes and said, "Oh my, my, my"

Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh my, my, my, my

Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, "Oh my, my, my"

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside 'til the morning light
Oh my, my, my, my

A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said "I do" and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I

I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh my, my, my

"Our Song"

I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel
On the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothing
I was just thinking
How we don't have a song"
And he says...

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have."
And when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen"
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up
The front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong
And been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway,
Well, on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice
All the roses
And the note that said...

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen"
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song...

'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen"
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again

Oh, yeah...
Oh-oh, yeah

I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen
And an old napkin
And I wrote down our song

"I'm Only Me When I'm With You"

Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are paintin' pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side

And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

Just a small town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do

And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
And only you can tell

...That I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you

"Invisible"

She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by

And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do

And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, we're invisible
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize

I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
Baby, let me love you
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile

"A Perfectly Good Heart"

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say, I still can't believe
That you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

It's not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before?

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

"Last Christmas"

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying 'I love you'. I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year
Maybe this year I'll give it to someone special

'Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

"Christmases When You Were Mine"

Please take down the mistletoe
'Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
'Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
Season's greetings, hope you're well
Well I'm doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
And everybody's here, except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold

But for me it's just a lonely time
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

Merry Christmas, everybody
That'll have to be something I just say this year
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again?
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands?

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

You were mine

"Santa Baby"

Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree for me
I've been an awful good girl, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
Well, I'll wait up for you, dear, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the boys I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot
I've been an angel all year, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa, honey, there's one more thing I really do need
The deed
To a platinum mine, Santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
And I don't mean on the phone, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

"Silent Night"

Silent night, holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah
Christ the Saviour is born
Christ our Saviour is born

Silent night, holy night
Son of God
Love's pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Jesus Lord at thy birth

Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Hallelujah!
Christ the Saviour is born

"Christmas Must Be Something More"

What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing?
Would the song still survive without five golden rings?
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?
What would happen if God never let it snow?
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie?
Tell me, what would you find?

You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

What if angels did not pay attention to
All the things that we wished they would always do?
What if happiness came in a cardboard box?
Then I think there is something we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away?
Tell me, what would you find?

You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships
Hundred-mile-an-hour lives
And it's this time of year
And everybody's here
It seems the last thing on your mind

Is that the day holds something special
Something holy, not superficial?
So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
But here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more

There's gotta be more
There's gotta be more

"White Christmas"

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
So may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

"Jump Then Fall"

I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard

I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, oh, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'mma stay through it all
So jump then fall

Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted

I had time to think it all over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me
'Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa, oh, I'm feeling you baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'mma stay through it all
So jump then fall

The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

Whoa, oh, I need you baby
Don't be afraid, please,
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'mma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall, baby,
Jump then fall into me, into me

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine
And every time you're here
Baby I'll show you, I'll show you
You can jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah

"Untouchable"

Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you
I'm caught up in you

Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of Heaven

It's half full, and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway

But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on

Oh, in the middle of the night
Waking from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of Heaven

I'm caught up in you. Oh, oh

But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh, oh

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, come on

In the middle of the night
Waking from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of Heaven

In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, oh, oh, oh

Like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
They're spelling out your name, oh

"Forever & Always (Piano Version)"

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
We caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When he said "forever and always"
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said "forever and always"

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest?
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When he said "forever and always"
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said "forever and always"

You didn't mean it baby
I don't think so, oh oh oh
Back up, baby back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby back up
Did you forget everything?

Back up, baby back up
Please back up, oh back up
Back up, baby back up

'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said "forever and always"

And I stare at the phone
He still hasn't called
And then you feel so low
You can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When we said "forever and always"
'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here
And it rains when you're gone
I was there when you said "forever and always"

You didn't mean it baby
You said "forever and always", yeah

"Come In With The Rain"

I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore

Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain

I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down
I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start

Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Oh, just know I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain

I've watched you so long
Screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say

But I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games
Just know I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain

I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore

"Superstar"

This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

Morning loneliness, comes around when I'm not
Dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face, I'd be
Counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another
Wide eyed girl who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar
Sweet, sweet superstar, superstar

"The Other Side Of The Door"

In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said, "This time I've had enough."
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up

'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread

So babe if you know everything, tell me why you couldn't see
That when I left I wanted you to chase after me

Yeah, I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

And I'll scream out the window
"I can't even look at you!"
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, "There's nothing you can say to make this right again
I mean it, I mean it."
What I mean is

I said, "Leave," but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you."
Wait there in the pouring rain, come back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you

"Fearless"

There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah
Oh yeah

We're drivin' down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

So, baby, drive slow
'Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake
I'm not usually this way
But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss
It's flawless
Really something
It's fearless

Oh yeah

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Oh-oh
Oh yeah

"Fifteen"

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say "Hi" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know I haven't seen you around before."

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And your mamma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
When you're fifteen
And your first kiss makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
Don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

"Love Story"

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts:
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello."
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go."
And I said

"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."

So, I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So, close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go!"
And I said

"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting. All there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'

Romeo, save me. They're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but it's real
Don't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."

Oh, oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said

"Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think."
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

"Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress
It's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'."

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

"Hey Stephen"

Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah

Hey, Stephen
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked
We were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to

Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey, Stephen
Boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So, come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Hey, Stephen
I've been holding back this feeling
So, I got some things to say to you, ha
I've seen it allâ
So I thoughtâ
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do

The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my nameâ
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey, Stephen
Why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So, come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

They're dimming the street lights
You're perfect for me. Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so, come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine

Hey, Stephen
I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girlsâ
Well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?
(Ha-ha)

I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So, come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

...if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So, come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Myself
Can't help myself
I can't help myself

"White Horse"

Say you're sorry
That face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on
The days drag on
Stupid girl
I should have known, I should have known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

Maybe I was naÃ¯ve
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings
Now I know

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to come around

And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness, begging for me
Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairy tale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse to catch me now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now
Oh, it's too late
To catch me now

"You Belong With Me"

You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset, she's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do

I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
"Hey, isn't this easy?"

And you've got a smile
That could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while
Since she brought you down

You say you're fine I know you better than that
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see
That I'm the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So, why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see
That I'm the one
Who understands you?
Been here all along
So, why can't you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me

Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me

"Breathe"
(feat. Colbie Caillat)

[Taylor Swift:]
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

[Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat:]
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

It's 2 AM, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 AM, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh-oh

I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Mmm)
I'm sorry, (Yeah, yeah) I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry

"Tell Me Why"

I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know, that you see, what you're doing to me
Tell me why

You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh

I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know, that you see, what you're doing to me
Tell me why

Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why (Why)
Tell me why (Why)

I take a step back, let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know

"You're Not Sorry"

All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long
Baby but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry... no, no, no, no

You are looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life
If you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
'Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry... no, no, no

You're not sorry... no, no, no

You had me crawling for you honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry... no, no, no

You're not sorry... no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

"The Way I Loved You"

He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2 AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2 AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2 AM and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh

And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

"Forever & Always"

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always

And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby
You said forever and always, yeah

"The Best Day"

I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today

"Change"

And it's a sad picture
The final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again
And you know it's all the same
Another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it

But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

So we've been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger
But we're faster and never scared

You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this

'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

Tonight we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah

"Mine"

You were in college working part-time waiting tables
Left a small town, and never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lying on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight
Two-thirty AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the "Goodbye"
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone."

You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine."

Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back

(Hold on)
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
(Hold on)
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

(Hold on)
Yeah, yeah
Do you believe it?
(Hold on)
We're gonna make it now
(Hold on)
And I can see it
(Yes, yes)
I can see it now (see it now, see it now)

"Sparks Fly"

The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

I'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly

"Back To December"

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while

You've been good, busier than ever
We small-talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night,"
And I go back to December all the time

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call

And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was "Goodbye"

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night."
And I go back to December all the time

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night:
The first time you ever saw me cry

Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying, "I'm sorry for that night."
And I go back to December

It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind

I go back to December all the time
All the time

"Speak Now"

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white-veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

Don't say "Yes", run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now."

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me
Don't you?

Don't say "Yes", run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now."
Don't say "Yes", run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said, "Speak now."

Oh, la, la
Oh, oh
Say a single vow

I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace."
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a white-veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

So, don't say "Yes", run away now
I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now."
And you say, "Let's run away now
I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around
When they said, "Speak now."

"Dear John"

Long were the nights
When my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through
Again

And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules every day

Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up, and this song is to let you know why

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed
With?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home
I should've known

Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism
To blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love then take it away

And you'll add my name
To your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret
How I ignored when they said
"Run as fast as you can."

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed
With?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

Dear John
I see it all now. It was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played
By your dark twisted games?
When I loved you so
I should've known

You are an expert at "Sorry"
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry
Have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you've burned them out

But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So, don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town

Dear John
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed
With?
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed
With?
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song
You should've known

You should've known
Don't you think I was too young?
You should've known

"Mean"

You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah

Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

"The Story Of Us"

I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones."
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fall-out
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up I can't break through

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Next chapter

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side

The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armour down
If you said you'd rather love than fight

So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
But I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now

...and we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say, since the twist of fate 'cause we're going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

The end

"Never Grow Up"

Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up, never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

Oh, I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
I could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
Oh, don't you ever grow up
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up

"Enchanted"

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired lonely place

Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy

And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, "Hey
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you."

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
(Please don't be in love with someone else)
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
(Please don't have somebody waiting on you)
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
(Please don't be in love with someone else)
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

"Better Than Revenge"

"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did."

Time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say "sabotage"

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress
She's better known
For the things that she does on the mattress

Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
They wouldn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress
She's better known
For the things that she does
On the mattress

Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him but I always get the last word

She's not a saint
And she's not what you think
She's an actress
(She deserve it)
She's better known
For the things that she does on the mattress

Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do
(No, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
I don't think you do
I don't think you do

Let's hear the applause
(Come on, come on)
Come on show me how much better you are
(So much better, yeah?)
So you deserve some applause 'cause you're so much better

She took him faster than you could say "sabotage"

"Innocent"

I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not what you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Lost your balance on a tightrope
It's never too late to get it back

"Haunted"

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

Oh, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead

Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I know, I know, I just know
You're not gone. You can't be gone. No

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted

Oh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it

"Last Kiss"

I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last

"Long Live"

I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild

We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew
Our lives would never be the same

You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines wishing for right now

We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd!"
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves
In ripped-up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Will you take a moment
Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in

And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name

Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life, with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

"Ours"

Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now my time is theirs

Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care 'cause right now you're mine

And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate
If it's wrong and
Your hands are tough
But they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you

'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours

The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

"If This Was A Movie"

Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
"Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose."

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

If you're out there
If you're somewhere
If you're moving on
I've been waiting for you
Ever since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my front door
And I'd say

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said, "It's not that easy."
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby, what about the ending
Oh, I thought you'd be here by now, whoa
Thought you'd be here by now

"Superman"

Tall, dark and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say

And you smile and say, "How are you?"
I'll say, "Just fine."
I always forget to tell you, I love you, I'll love you forever

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say

And you'll leave, got places to be
And I'll be OK
I always forget to tell you I love you, I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world I'll be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away but I never let you go
I'm love-struck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you

'Cause I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

When you come back down

"State Of Grace"

I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know
Is touch and go

We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know
Is don't let go

We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs
Four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles' heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never (never) be the same

And I never (never) saw you coming
And I'll never
(So you were never a saint
I've loved in shades of wrong)
Be the same
(We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild)

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

"Red"

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

(Red, red)
(Red, red)
Loving him was red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone (whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
(Red, red)
Oh, red
(Red, red)
Burning red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone (whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
(Red, red)
Yeah, yeah, red
(Red, red)
We're burning red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)

And that's why he's spinnin' 'round in my head
(Red, red)
Comes back to me, burning red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)
Yeah, yeah
(Red, red)

His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street

"Treacherous"

Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you aâget you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I... I, I, I... I, I, I

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, I'll get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

"I Knew You Were Trouble"

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies. He'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there)
So shame on me now (Knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

"All Too Well"

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost Upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone
And that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay
But I'm not fine at all

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on a tee-ball team
You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

Maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well

And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all... too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

"22"

It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh uh, uh uh

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time

Uh oh!
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh (who's Taylor Swift anyway, ew?)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping

Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical
Oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time

Uh oh! (hey!)
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright (alright)
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh (oh, oh, oh)
22, ooh-ooh
I don't know about you
22, ooh-ooh
22, ooh-ooh

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ye-e-e-e-eah, hey
I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If you keep me next to you
You don't know about me (you don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright
If we just keep dancing like we're
22, ooh-ooh (oh â whoa)
22, ooh-ooh (dancing like)
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
22, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

"I Almost Do"

I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out there's no reply
I bet it never ever occurred to you that I can't say "Hello" to you
And risk another goodbye

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It's probably better off this way
And I confess, babe
In my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I wanna try again with you
And I almost do

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do

I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me

"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough," 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space. (What?)
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me."
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you."

Ooh, we called it off again last night
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Ooh, yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Oh oh oh

I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say, "Never say never..."
Uggg... so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you,"
And I'm like... "I just... I mean this is exhausting, you know, like
We are never getting back together. Like, ever"

No!

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

We, ooh, getting back together, ohhh
We, ooh, getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

"Stay Stay Stay"

I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away
But you stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, "Okay, let's talk."

And I said
Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to

Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me:
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hangin' out with you all the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life

Stay
And I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me, when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

That's so fun!

"The Last Time"
(feat. Gary Lightbody)

[Gary Lightbody:]
I find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I'm not sure how I got there
All roadsâthey lead me here

I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

[Both:]
And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

[Taylor Swift:]
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave

And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

[Both:]
And right before your eyes
I'm aching, no past
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
This is the last time I say it's been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore

Oh, oh, oh

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

This is the last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this

"Holy Ground"

I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York Time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light "Go"
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

And darling, it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of "I need you"
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

'Cause darling, it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you

It was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you

"Sad Beautiful Tragic"

Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

In dreams I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons, and, darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up and for the life of us we can't get back

A beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic, beautiful tragic, beautiful

What we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

"The Lucky One"

New to town with a made up name in the angel's city
Chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream

You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties' queen

Another name goes up in lights, like diamonds in the sky

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh

Now it's big black cars, and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page

And they tell you that you're lucky
But you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights. You wonder if you'll make it out alive

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh

It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

'Cause now my name is up in lights, but I think you got it right

Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh

Yeah they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, oh, oh

"Everything Has Changed"
(duet with Ed Sheeran)

[Ed Sheeran:]
You good to go?

[Taylor Swift:]
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now, know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind making me feel like

I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now

[Both:]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

[Ed Sheeran:]
And all my walls stood tall painted blue
And I'll take them down, take them down and open up the door for you

[Taylor Swift:]
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right

[Both:]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
Oh, oh, oh
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

[Taylor Swift:]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Both:]
All I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

[Taylor Swift:]
All I know is we said, "Hello"
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain and everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday is everything has changed

"Starlight"

I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up late one night out the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, "Look at you: worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way."
He was tryna skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

Like "Oh my, what a marvelous tune."
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh, ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh, ooh, dancing with me
Ooh, ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?

"Begin Again"

Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do

Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl
Who had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies that your family
Watches
Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that
And for the first time what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months

Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

"The Moment I Knew"

You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that 'baby I'm right here' smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy

Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there's one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
"He said he'd be here."

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do when the one
Who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me singing
"Happy birthday to you"
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

Ooh, I knew
Ooh

You called me later
And said, "I'm sorry, I didn't make it,"
And I said, "I'm sorry too,"
And that was the moment I knew

"Come Back... Be Here"

You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself, "Don't get attached,"
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back... be here, come back... be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back... be here, come back... be here

The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would have played so nonchalant

Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back... be here, come back... be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back... be here, come back... be here

This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away

New York... be here
But you're in London and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around

This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back... be here, come back... be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back... be here, come back... be here

I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back... be here
Come back... be here

"Girl At Home"

Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Uh, uh
Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that

I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But honey I am no-one's exception
This I have previously learned

So don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Uh, uh
Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you got me alone
And I say
Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that

I just wanna make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And yeah I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her

Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Uh, uh
Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone
And I say
Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that

Call a cab
Lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab
Lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned

Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Uh, uh
Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Uh, uh
Don't look at me
You've got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that

It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn't once been just like her

"Welcome To New York"

Walking through a crowd
The village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud
Heartbeats under coats
Everybody here
Wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't
Heard before
And it said

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat
Forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on
Apartment floors
Took our broken hearts
Put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else
Before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and
Girls and girls

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat
Forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York (New York)
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Like any great love it keeps you
Guessing
Like any real love
It's ever-changing
Like any true love

It drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't
Change anything anything
Anything

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

New soundtrack
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright
They never blind me
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

"Blank Space"

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"
Ayy

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

"Style"

Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh, it's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)

I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, hmm, yeah
I say, "I heard, oh, that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl."

He says, "What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you," and I
I said, "I've been there, too, a few times."

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go)
We never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home, yeah
Just take me home
(Out of style)

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down (when we go)
We come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

"Out Of The Woods"

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods?

Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (we decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinkin'

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Oh
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods?

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started cryin', baby, I did, too
But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out and said, "I'm settin' you free,"
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were lookin' at me

You were lookin' at me
You were lookin' at me

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
I remember
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Oh, I remember

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
(Yeah)
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods yet?

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
(Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet?
(Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

"All You Had To Do Was Stay"

(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)

People like you always want back the love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
The more I think about it now the less I know
All I know is that you drove us off the road

Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
Stay
Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye

Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
Stay
Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Let me remind you
This was what you wanted
You ended it
You were all I wanted
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this

Oh, all you had to do was...

Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
Stay
Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
Stay
Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
(All you had to do was stay)
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

"Shake It Off"

I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't see, mmm-mmm

I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world,
You could've been getting down to this sick beat.

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like "Oh, my God!" but I'm just gonna shake.
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake

Yeah ohhh

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate)
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (mmmm)
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (and fake, and fake, and fake)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (you've got to),
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

"I Wish You Would"

It's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that I'd never forget you as long as I live
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

It's 2 AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that I'd never forget you as long as I live
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)

(I wish I, wish I)

2 AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that I'd never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that I'd never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore
I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)

I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish you would

"Bad Blood"

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Did you have to do this? I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Did you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last
Now did you think it all through? All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't, so if you're coming my way, just don't

Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love

Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey)
You say sorry just for show (hey)
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (hey)
Mhmmm
If you love like that blood runs cold

"Wildest Dreams"

He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ha, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' (Burnin') it (It) down (Down)
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow (Follow) you (You) around
(Follow you around)

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (Just pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
Even if it's just in your
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha

"How You Get The Girl"

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Stand there like a ghost
Shaking from the rain, rain
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane?"
Say it's been a long six months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want

And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And then, you say

I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (Oh-oh, oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl

Remind her how it used to be, be, yeah-yeah
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tell her how you must have lost your mind, ooh-ooh
When you left her all alone
And never told her why, why

And that's how it works
That's how you lost the girl
And now, you say

I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together

Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me, yeah-yeah
And then you say

Broke your heart, I'll put it back together

That's how it works
That's how you got the girl

"This Love"

Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind, only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone

Been losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)

Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young, you just run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
(This love) This love left a permanent mark
(This love) This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
(This love) These hands had to let it go free, and
(This love) This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love)
This love, this love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

"I Know Places"

(I, I, I, I I, I, I, I I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I)

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They take their shots, but we're bulletproof
I know places
And you know for me, it's always you
I know places
In the dead of night, your eyes so green
I know places
And I know for you, it's always me
I know places

(I, I, I, I I, I, I, I I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I)

"Clean"

The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You're still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

There was nothing left to do (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Said, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
(Oh)

The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

(Oh, oh)
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
(Oh, oh, oh)
Think I'm finally clean

"Wonderland"

Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down a rabbit hole

You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?

Oh

Didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
Eh eh

Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed

But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams

Oh

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?

Oh

Didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind

But darling, we found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
Eh eh

Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland

I reached for you but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else to make you feel like what we had
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad

Oh

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (last forever)
Eh eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better (never better)
Eh eh

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (wonderland)
And we pretended it could last forever (in wonderland)

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (wonderland)
And life was never worse but never better
In wonderland

"You Are In Love"

One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast
You play it back
Buttons on a coat
Lighthearted joke
No proof, not much
But you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects
The chain on your neck
He says, "Look up."
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
But you felt enough

You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence) you
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home) you
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love

Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word
And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much
But it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight then you talk
One night he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says
"You're my best friend."
And you knew what it was
He is in love

You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence) you
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home) you
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love

And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe 'round and 'round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence) you
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home) you
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love

You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence) you
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home) you
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love

"New Romantics"

We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We're so young but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace

We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come on, come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded
It's so romantic (it's so romantic)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

Oh, 'cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

'Cause baby, I could build a castle (castle)
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

"...Ready For It?"

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know (No one has to know)

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Oh, are you ready for it?

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night (Night), in my dreams (My dreams)
You should see the things we do (We do), baby (Baby), hmm (Eh)
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (My dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you (I know I'm gonna be with you)
So I take my time
In the middle of the night

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?

"End Game"
(feat. Ed Sheeran and Future)

[Taylor Swift and Future:]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
I wanna be your end game, end game

Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
 I got some big enemies (Yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)
You like the bad ones, too

[Future:]
You so dope, don't overdose, I'm so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat
I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me (Yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (Yeah)
I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (What they like)
You love it, I love it too 'cause you're my type (You're my type)
You hold me down and I protect you with my life

[Taylor Swift and Future:]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play

[Taylor Swift:]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Ed Sheeran:]
Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

[Taylor Swift:]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Taylor Swift and Future:]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
 I got some big enemies
Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too

[Taylor Swift:]
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

[Swift, Future, and Ed Sheeran:]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Me and you, first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team now, A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (Oh, I do)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

"I Did Something Bad"

I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it lookâohâso easy

'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson-red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit
Then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit
'Cause he had it coming

They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me

They never see it comin', what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, "Don't throw away a good thing."
But if he drops my name
Then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change
Then he had it comin'

They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

It just felt so good

They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof, their receipts and reasons

They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
So light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up, go ahead and light me up (light me up)

Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up (light me up), light me up

They say I did something bad (oh)
Then why's it feel so good? (so good)
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had (most fun I ever had)
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good (good), good

Oh, you say I did something bad
(You say I did something bad?)
Why's it feel so good, good?
So bad, why's it feel so good?
Why's it feel, why's it feel so good? (bad)
It just felt so good, good

"Don't Blame Me"

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

I've been breaking hearts a long time
And toying with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacing, I just need you

For you
I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, "She's gone too far this time."

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)
Echoes (echoes) of your name inside my mind
Halo, hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

And, baby, for you
I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away
I'd beg you on my knees to stay

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

I get so high, oh
Every time you'reâevery time you're loving me
You're loving me
Trip of my life, oh
Every time you'reâevery time you're touching me
You're touching me

Every time you'reâevery time you're loving me

Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life
(Using for the rest of my life. Oh!)

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (doing it right, no)
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (you ain't doing it...)
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life (I'll be using, I'll be using)

I get so high, oh
Every time you'reâevery time you're loving me
You're loving me
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

"Delicate"

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do

'Cause I like you
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Delicate

Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share

'Cause I like you
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Delicate

Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
'Cause I like you

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Yeah, I want you
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
'Cause I like you
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?

"Look What You Made Me Do"

I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh!)

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams

(Ooh, look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you just made me do)
"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now."
(Look what you just made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
"Why?"
(Look what you just made me do)
"Oh, 'cause she's dead!" (Oh!)

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

"So It Goes..."

See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip, trippin' when you're gone

'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

And all the pieces fall
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes

Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your grey days clear and
Wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip, skippin' when I'm gone

'Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

And all the pieces fall
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes

Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes

You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
I did a number on you
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
Who's counting?
1, 2, 3

And all the pieces fall (pieces fall)
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment (caught up, caught up)
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
I'm yours to keep (oh)
And I'm yours to lose (baby)
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes

Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes

"Gorgeous"

Gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doing, I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)

Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (but you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (dark room, dark room)
If you got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
(Honey, it hurts)

Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Yeugh), alone
Unless, you wanna come along? (Oh)

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say? (I say)
You're gorgeous

You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (It turns back to sad)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have (What I can have)
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous

"Getaway Car"

No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn't see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

"X" marks the spot, where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lying to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark

You were driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinking
And I was just drinking
Well he was running after us, I was screaming, 'Go, go, go!'
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (we're both sorry)

"X" marks the spot, where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart

You were driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

We were jet-set Bonnie and Clyde
Until I switched to the other side
To the other side
It's no surprise, I turned you in
'Cause us traitors never win

I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me

Driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Should've known)
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

I was riding in a getaway car
I was crying in a getaway car
I was dying in a getaway car
Said 'goodbye' in a getaway car

I was riding in a getaway car
I was crying in a getaway car
I was dying in a getaway car
Said 'goodbye' in a getaway car

"King Of My Heart"

I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up my mind, I'm better off being alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin' me "baby" like tryin' on clothes

Salute to me I'm your American Queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa

And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

Late in the night, the city's asleep
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury

Salute to me I'm your American Queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
(Inside my room, oh)
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do (Where you do)

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul, ooh whoa

And all at once (Hey), I've been waiting, waiting (Waiting)
Ooh, whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one
I have been waiting (Waiting), waiting (Waiting)
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

Is this the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul (My soul), ooh whoa

And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once
'Cause you're the one I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

"Dancing With Our Hands Tied"

I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, 25 years old
Oh, how were you to know and

My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know what

I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling

But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance
Oh, through an avalanche?
And say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me

I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling

But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
(Ooh, we had our hands tied)
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again (Again)

Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Oh, yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time (First time, first time)
Yeah, we were dancing (Oh)
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
(Dancing with our hands tied)
Yeah, we were dancing (Ooh)
And I had a bad feeling (Had a bad feeling)
But we were dancing

(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Hands tied, hands tied (Dancing)

"Dress"

Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo

All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah

Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I'm spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothing aboutâ

All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha

Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah

There is an indentation in the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

"This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things"

It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm)
If only you weren't so shady

This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Yeah)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have

Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about the he-said, she-said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face

This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Darling)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Uh-uh) things (Oh no), honey (Baby, oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
(And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them
I had to take them
(And here's to my baby)
Nice things, honey
(They didn't care about that he-said, she-said)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

"Call It What You Want"

My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doing better than I ever was

'Cause
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover
Making forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparking up my darkest night

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November, holding my breath
Slowly I said, "You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?"
Yes (would you run away?)

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

(Call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
Call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want
To

"New Year's Day"

There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Please don't ever become a stranger
(To the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Please don't ever become a stranger
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(I will hold on to you)

"I Forgot That You Existed"

How many days did I spend thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
Lived in the shade you were throwing
'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
And I couldn't get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
Free rent, living in my mind

But then something happened one magical night

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show

But you showed who you are, then one magical night

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
It's all just a blur

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
I did, I did, I did
It isn't hate, it's just indifference
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
So, yeah

"Cruel Summer"

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks up, grinning like a devil

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

"Lover"

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my
Lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my
Lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be over-dramatic and true to my
Lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat
Lover

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my
Lover

"The Man"

I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play
I'd be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man)
Then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Oh)
I'd be the man (Yeah)
I'd be the man (I'd be the man)

If I was a man, then I'd be the man

"The Archer"

Combat
I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that
But what if I do?

'Cause cruelty
Wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches
I almost said to you

Easy they come
Easy they go
I jump from the train
I ride off alone
I never grew up
It's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?

Dark side
I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright
Right, right, right here?

And I cut off
My nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection
For years and years

I wake in the night
I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire
Invisible smoke
And all of my heroes
Die all alone
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Screaming, "Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?"

(I see right through me, I see right through me)

'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

All the king's horses
All the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies
Started out friends
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?

(I see right through me, I see right through me)

Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay

Combat
I'm ready for combat

"I Think He Knows"

I think he knows
His footprints on the sidewalk
Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night
I think he knows
His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it's mine

He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
It's like I'm 17, nobody understands
No one understands

He got my heartbeat
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, oh, I mean
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

I think he knows
When we get all alone
I'll make myself at home
And he'll want me to stay
I think he knows
He better lock it down
Or I won't stick around
'Cause good ones never wait (Ha)

He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
He's so obsessed with me and, boy, I understand
Boy, I understand

He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, oh, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my soul
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my soul

Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We can follow the sparks, I'll drive
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We can follow the sparks, I'll drive
"So where we gonna go?"
I whisper in the dark
"Where we gonna go?"
I think he knows

He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue (Baby)
Got that, oh, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like (Yeah)
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my soul
I want you, bless my (Oh, baby)
I want you, bless my soul (He got my heartbeat)
I want you, bless my (Skipping down 16th Avenue, baby)
I want you, bless my soul
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows

"Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince"

You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at sixteen, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)

No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared (Ah)

No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I just thought you should know
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win)

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
Oh, I just thought you should know (You should know)
It's you and me, there's nothing like this (Like this)
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue (Paint it blue)
Voted most likely to run away with you

And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win), I just thought you should know

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
"She's a bad, bad girl"

"Paper Rings"

The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

(Ayy)
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings in picture frames in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

(Ayy)
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause you waited your whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)
Ah

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings in picture frames in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
Uh huh

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right, you're the one I want
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Ah-ah, darling, you're the one I want
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings in picture frames in all my dreams
You're the one I want
In paper rings in picture frames in all my dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

You're the one I want, one I want
You're the one I want, one I want

"Cornelia Street"

We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

I don't wanna lose you (Hope it never ends)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)

"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car

"Death By A Thousand Cuts"

My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?

'Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not

It's death by a thousand cuts

My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)

Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no

I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"

"London Boy"

[Idris Elba and James Corden:]
We can go driving in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just 'round London
Alright, yeah

I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives

You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)

And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English

You know I love a London boy, I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you

So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney, on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you (Oh)

You know I love a London boy, I enjoy walking SoHo
Drinking in the afternoon (Yeah)
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you (You)
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true (Yeah)
You know I love a London boy (Oh)
Boy (Oh), I fancy you (I fancy you, ooh)

So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
I, I, I fancy you
Oh whoa, oh, I
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney, on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Ooh)
Wanna be with you
I fancy you (Yeah), I fancy you
Oh whoa, ah

"Soon You'll Get Better"
(feat. Dixie Chicks)

The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you

Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I say to you

Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If there's no you?

This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because
'Cause I have to

Ooh-ah
You'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

"False God"

We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I'd fly to you?

And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town
I'm New York City, I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love

I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah

Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love

"You Need To Calm Down"

You are somebody that I don't know
But you're taking shots at me like it's PatrÃ³n
And I'm just like, "Damn!
It's 7 AM"

Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey!
Are you OK?"

And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned the lesson
That stressing and obsessing
'Bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to just stop
Like, can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down"

You are somebody that we don't know
But you're coming at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad
When you could be GLAAD?
(You could be GLAAD)

Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Just making that sign
Must've taken all night

You just need to take several seats
And then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream
About all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to just stop
Like, can you just not step on his gown
You need to calm down"

And we see you over there on the Internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now
We all got crowns
You need to calm down

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to calm down
(You need to calm down)
You're being too loud
(You're being too loud)
And I'm just like
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to just stop
(Can you stop?)
Like, can you just not step on our gowns
You need to calm down"

"Afterglow"

I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something you didn't do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no

Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there's no us
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say

Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh

I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, don't walk away, I need to say

Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
I'm sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

Tell me that you're still mine
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say

Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

"ME!"
(feat. Brendon Urie of Panic! At The Disco)

[Taylor Swift:]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

I know that I'm a handful baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like me-e-e-eh

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me-e-eh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you

And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e-eh

[Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift:]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Living in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like me-e-e-eh

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company-e-e-eh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you

And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e-eh

[Single version:
"Hey, kids.
Spelling is fun!"]

Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
Strike the band up 1, 2, 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me

Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
And you can't spell "awesome" without "me"
I promise that you'll never find another like me-e-e-eh

Yeah, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(And I want you, baby)
I'm the only one of me
(I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me-e-e-eh
(Baby, that's the fun of me)

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e-eh

Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team"
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
But you know there is a "me"
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me-e-e-eh

Strike the band up 1, 2, 3
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You can't spell "awesome" without "me"
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you

And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e-eh

"It's Nice To Have A Friend"

Ooh
Ooh

School bell rings, walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves, you give me one
"Wanna hang out?" Yeah, sounds like fun
Video games, you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents

It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)

Light pink sky up on the roof
Sun sinks down, no curfew
20 questions, we tell the truth
You've been stressed out lately, yeah, me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand

It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)

Church bells ring, carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow
Call my bluff, call you "Babe"
Have my back, yeah, every day
Feels like home, stay in bed
The whole weekend

It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
(Ooh)

"Daylight"

My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (daylight), I only see daylight (daylight)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burning red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
(And I can still see it all)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(I once believed love would be burning red)

Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things that I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
Not the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I, I just think that
You are what you love

"the 1"

I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though

I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinee
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the Internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now

I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day, waking up alone

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

Hey, yeah-yeah
I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

We were something, don't you think so?
RosÃ© flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

"cardigan"

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancing in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends
I, I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleeding

'Cause I knew you
Stepping on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy
I, I knew you
Leaving like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasing shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standing in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

"the last great american dynasty"

Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcÃ©e do it?"

The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

And they said, "There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything."

Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with DalÃ­

And they said, "There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything."

They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness
Their men and bad habits, and then it was bought by me

Who knows, if I never showed up what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
I had a marvelous time
Ruining everything
A marvelous time
Ruining everything
A marvelous time
I had a marvelous time

"exile"
(feat. Bon Iver)

[Justin Vernon:]
I can see you standin', honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin' but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defendin' now?
You were my town
Now I'm in exile seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before

Hoo, hoo-ooh
Hoo, hoo-ooh
Hoo, hoo-ooh

[Taylor Swift:]
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown
Now I'm in exile seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door

[Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift:]
So step right out
There is no amount
Of cryin' I can do for you

All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs
So many signs (You didn't even see the signs)

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town
Now I'm in exile seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door

So step right out
There is no amount
Of cryin' I can do for you

All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
You never gave a warning sign (All this time)
(So many times) I never learned to read your mind
(So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)
You never gave a warning sign
Ah, ah

"my tears ricochet"

We gather here
We line up weeping in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire
You'll be made of ashes, too

Even on my worst day
Did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you
I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around saving face
And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

We gather stones
Never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw
Some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to
Have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels
That I gave you
As you bury me

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want
Just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you
When I'm screaming at the sky
And when you can't sleep at night
You hear my stolen lullabies

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame
Drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

"mirrorball"

I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break it's in a million pieces

Hush
When no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush
I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten

Hush
When no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush
I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

And they called off the circus
Burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses
And the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
I'm still a believer but I don't know why
I've never been a natural
All I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything
To keep you looking at me

Because I'm a mirrorball
I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself
Tonight

"seven"

Please picture me
In the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet
In the swing
Over the creek
I was too scared to jump in, but I, I was high
In the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?

Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with
Me and we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on

Please picture me
In the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream
Ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I

Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Our love lasts so long

"august"

Salt air
And the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers
Of "Are you sure?"
"Never have I ever before"

But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Your back
Beneath the sun
Wishing I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinking I had you

But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Back when we were still changing for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say "Meet me behind the mall"
So much for summer love, and saying "Us"
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose
No

But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine, mine

'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up
And said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans
Just in case you'd call?
Back when I was living for the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
"Meet me behind the mall"

(Remember when I pulled up)
(And said "Get in the car")
(And then canceled my plans)
(Just in case you'd call?)
(Back when I was living for the hope of it all)
(For the hope of it all)
("Meet me behind the mall")

Remember when I pulled up
And said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans
Just in case you'd call?
Back when I was living for the hope of it all
(For the hope of it all)
For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all

"this is me trying"

I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway

I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying

They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pourin' out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying

At least I'm trying

And it's hard to be at a party
When I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days
When all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel
On the one screen in my town

And I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying (And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying

At least I'm trying

"illicit affairs"

Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head
Keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You'll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings
And longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
...a million little times

Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don't even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times

And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings
And stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
...a million little times

And you wanna scream
Don't call me "kid"
Don't call me "baby"
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me "kid"
Don't call me "baby"
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else
And you know damn well
For you I would ruin myself
...a million little times

"invisible string"

Green was the color of the grass where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt when you were 16 at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money

Time
Curious time
Gave me no compasses
Gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?

Bad was the blood of the song in the cab on your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer

Time
Mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?

A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold tied me to you

Cold was the steel of my axe to grind for the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves when I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven

Time
Wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool
Baby with me
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

(Ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah)

"mad woman"

What did you think I'd say to that?
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
They strike to kill and you know I will
You know I will

What do you sing on your drive home?
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
Does she smile?
Or does she mouth, "Fuck you forever"?

Every time you call me crazy
I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firing at your yacht
They say "move on"
But you know I won't
And women like hunting witches, too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
It's obvious that wanting me dead has really brought you two together

Every time you call me crazy
I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

I'm taking my time
Taking my time
'Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb
Watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin
Has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad
Should be scathing like me
But no one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad

You made her like that

"epiphany"

Keep your helmet
Keep your life, son
Just a flesh wound
Here's your rifle

Crawling up the beaches now
"Sir, I think he's bleeding out"
And some things you just can't speak about

With you, I serve
With you, I fall down
Down
Watch you breathe in
Watch you breathin' out
Out

Something med school
Did not cover
Someone's daughter
Someone's mother

Holds your hand through plastic now
"Doc, I think she's crashing out"
And some things you just can't speak about

Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen

With you, I serve
With you, I fall down
Down (Down)
Watch you breathe in
Watch you breathin' out
Out

With you, I serve
With you, I serve
With you, I fall down (Down)
Down (Down)
Watch you breathe in
Watch you breathe in
Watch you breathin' out (Out)
Out (Out)

Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen

"betty"

Betty, I won't make assumptions about why you switched your homeroom
But I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard when I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me?
Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen
I don't know anything but I know I miss you

Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing from the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found, I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me?
Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen
I don't know anything but I know I miss you

I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up
Like a figment of my worst intentions
She said "James, get in, let's drive"
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her but
I dreamt of you all summer long

Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now but, it's finally sinking in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when you see my face again
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you

So, I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me?
Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch in front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me
Will it be just like I dreamed it? Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen
I don't know anything
But I know I miss you
Standing in your cardigan
Kissing in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight, you know I miss you

"peace"

Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly this summer it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And it's just around the corner, darlin'
'Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace

But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details
But you got a friend in me
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace?

Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends
It's like I'm wastin' your honor

And you know that I'd
Swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east
Clowns to the West
I'd give you my sunshine
Give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come
If you're standing with me

But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details
But you got a friend in me
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace?

"hoax"

My only one
My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
This has frozen my ground

Stood on the cliffside
Screaming, "Give me a reason"
Your faithless love's the only hoax
I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue
But you
No other sadness in the world would do

My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire

Stood on the cliffside
Screaming "Give me a reason"
Your faithless love's the only hoax
I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue
But you
No other sadness in the world would do

You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died, so what's the movie for
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password, so I let you in the door
You knew you won, so what's the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
Darling, this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart

My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart

Don't want no other shade of blue
But you
No other sadness in the world would do

"the lakes"

Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?
I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse
No, not without you

"willow"

I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open/shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a 90's trend

Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open/shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

"champagne problems"

You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

Dom PÃ©rignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
"This dorm was once a madhouse"
I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready, so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
"She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

"gold rush"

Gleaming
Twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships
On waters so inviting
I almost jump in

I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

What must it be like
To grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door
At dinner parties
I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town
We wandered 'round had never
Seen a love as pure as it
And then it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it could never be

'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
And I don't like a gold rush

What must it be like
To grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I can't dare to dream about you anymore
At dinner parties
I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town
We never found will never
See a love as pure as it
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it will never be
Gleaming
Twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships
On waters so inviting
I almost jump in

"'tis the damn season"

If I wanted to know
Who you were hanging with
While I was gone, I would've asked you
It's the kind of cold
Fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There's an ache in you
Put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me

So we could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm staying at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

I parked my car
Right between the Methodist and the school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run but only so far
I escaped it too
Remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you
It's okay with me

We could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm staying at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies
Messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

Sleep in half the day
Just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait
If you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to LA
And the so-called friends who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul who can tell which smiles I'm faking
And the heart I know I'm breaking is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known

We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving
And I'll be yours for the weekend
'Tis the damn season

We could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm staying at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies
Messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
It always leads to you and my hometown

"tolerate it"

I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you, I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser and I

I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listen, I polish plates until they gleam and glisten
You're so much older and wiser and I

I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine
But what would you do if I

Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
I sit and watch you

Her husband's acting different and it smells like infidelity
She says, "That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"
No, there ain't no doubt
I think I'm gonna call him out
She says

[Taylor Swift and HAIM:]
I think he did it but I just can't prove it
I think he did it but I just can't prove it
I think he did it but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't letting up until the day I die

[HAIM:]
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

[Taylor Swift:]
Este wasn't there
Tuesday night at Olive Garden at her job or anywhere
He reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house his truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out
'Cause

[Taylor Swift and HAIM:]
I think he did it but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't letting up until the day I die
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was 15
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me ("She was with me dude")
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy

[Taylor Swift:]
They think she did it but they just can't prove it
They think she did it but they just can't prove it
She thinks I did it but she just can't prove it

[Taylor Swift and HAIM:]
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't letting up until the day he
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't letting up until the day he
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't letting up until the day he
Died

"happiness"

Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see this for what it is
But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given
Is just shit we're dividin' up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention
I haven't met the new me yet

There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I didn't mean that
Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury
You haven't met the new me yet

There'll be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things, I believe
There is happiness

In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
And there is happiness

I can't make it go away by making you a villain
I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him, too

Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven't met the new me yet
And I think she'll give you that

There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you, too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
Oh, leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

"dorothea"

Hey Dorothea
Do you ever stop and think about me?
When we were younger
Down in the park
Honey, making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya

Oooh
This place is the same as it ever was
Oooh
But you won't like it that way

It's never too late
To come back to my side
The stars in your eyes
Shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of being known
For who you know
You know that you'll always know me
Dorothea
Dorothea

Ooh, you're a queen
Selling dreams
Selling make-up and magazines
Ooh, from you I'd buy anything

Hey Dorothea
Do you ever stop and think about me?
When it was calmer
Skipping the prom
Just to piss off your mom
And her pageant schemes
And damn, Dorothea
They all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul
I met under the bleachers? Well

Oooh
I guess I'll never know
Oooh
And you'll go on with the show

But it's never too late
To come back to my side
The stars in your eyes
Shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of being known
For who you know
You know you'll always know me

Dorothea
Dorothea

Oooh
Oooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh
Oooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Dorothea

"coney island"
(feat. The National)

[Taylor Swift:]
Break my soul in two
Looking for you but you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?

And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Matt Berninger and Taylor Swift:]
The question pounds my head
"What's a lifetime of achievement?"
If I pushed you to the edge
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?
'Cause we were like the mall before the Internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line by the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day?
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest gray?
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium
I think that I forgot to say your name

I'm on a bench in Coney Island wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold
Over and over

Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down

The sight that flashed before me was your face
When the sun goes down
But I think that I forgot to say your name
Over and over
Sorry for not making you my
Making you my
Making you my centerfold

"ivy"

How's one to know?
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith-forgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand

And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don't, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living

Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you

I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
He's in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants what's only yours

Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered

Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose, the time is near
What would he do if he found us out?
Crescent moon, coast is clear
Spring breaks loose, but so does fear
He's gonna burn this house to the ground

How's one to know?
I'd live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
And drink my husband's wine

Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you
And I'm covered in you

So yeah, it's a fire
It's a goddamn blaze in the dark
And you started it
You started it
So yeah, it's a war
It's the goddamn fight of my life
And you started it
You started it

Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered
In you
In you
Now I'm covered in you
In you

"cowboy like me"

And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent-like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said, "Dancin' is a dangerous game."

Oh, I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
I'm never gonna love again

I've got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me

Never wanted love
Just a fancy car
Now I'm waiting by the phone
Like I'm sitting in an airport bar

You had some tricks up your sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me

Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

You're a cowboy like me

Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up
And the old men that I've swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunching have their stories about
When you passed through town
But that was all before I locked it down

Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con

I've had some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me
And I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again

"long story short"

Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles
'Til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it
'Til your high heels break

And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you
I'm all about you

Actually
I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us
This time I'm ready

'Cause I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you
I'm all about you

No more keepin' score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
No more tug of war
Now I just know there's more (Know there's more)
No more keepin' score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
And my waves meet your shore
Ever and evermore

Past me
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
Your nemeses will defeat themselves
Before you get the chance to swing
And he's passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it
Everywhere you go

And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff
Long story short, I survived
Now I'm all about you
(And now) I'm all about you, ah
(And now) I'm all about you
(And now) I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you
(And now) Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you

Long story short, it was a bad time
Long story short, I survived

"marjorie"

Never be so kind, you forget to be clever
Never be so clever, you forget to be kind

And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were talking to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

Never be so polite, you forget your power
Never wield such power, you forget to be polite

And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were listening to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

The autumn chill that wakes me up
You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
You'd always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I should've asked you questions
I should've asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me

What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were singing to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
I know better
But I still feel you all around
I know better
But you're still around

"closure"

It's been a long time
And seeing the shape of your name
Still spells out pain
It wasn't right
The way it all went down
Looks like you know that now

Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya
Right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over
I don't need your "closure"
Your "closure"

Don't treat me like some situation that needs to be handled
I'm fine with my spite
And my tears
And my beers and my candles
I can feel you smoothing me over

Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya
Right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over
I don't need your "closure"
Your "closure"
Your "closure"
Your "closure"

I know I'm just a
Wrinkle in your new life
Staying "friends"
Would iron it out so nice
Guilty, guilty reaching out across the sea
That you put between you and me
But it's fake
And it's oh so unnecessary

Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya
Right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over
I don't need your "closure"
"Closure"
Your "closure"
Your "closure"

"evermore"
(feat. Bon Iver)

[Taylor Swift:]
Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light

I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

Hey December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for

I rewind the tape but all it does is pause
On the very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed

[Taylor Swift and Justin Vernon:]
And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore
(Evermore)

[Justin Vernon:]
Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?

[Taylor Swift and Justin Vernon:]
And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost)
I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)
I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again)
(If you think of all the costs)
It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)
(Or the violence of the dog days)
(Out on waves, being tossed)
(I'm on waves, out being tossed)
I swear (Is there a line that we could just go cross?)
You were there

And I was catching my breath
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldn't be for
Evermore
Evermore
Evermore
This pain wouldn't be for evermore
Evermore

"right where you left me"

Friends break up, friends get married
Strangers get born, strangers get buried
Trends change, rumors fly through new skies
But I'm right where you left me
Matches burn after the other
Pages turn and stick to each other
Wages earned and lessons learned
But I'm right where you left me

Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, "What a sad sight," I
I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective, but I sat and stared
Right where you left me

You left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me, you left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever

Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?
Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
How it was supposed to be
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?
Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
And you're sitting in front of me

At the restaurant when I was still the one you want
Cross-legged in the dim light
Everything was just right, I
I could feel the mascara run
You told me that you met someone
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on

Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, "What a sad sight," I
I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
I'm sure that you got a wife out there
Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware
'Cause I'm right where
I cause no harm
Mind my business
If our love died young
I can't bear witness
And it's been so long
But if you ever think you got it wrong

I'm right where
You left me
You left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me
You left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever

"it's time to go"

When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab
Or that moment again he's insisting that friends
Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not
In fact what she seemed, not a twin from your dreams
She's a crook who was caught

That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

Twenty years at your job
Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse

That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing

Fifteen years, fifteen million tears
Begging 'til my knees bled
I gave it my all, he gave me nothing at all
Then wondered why I left
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
Praying to his greed
He's got my past frozen behind glass
But I've got me

That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul
I know when it's time to go

Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
That will find you the right thing
And you know in your soul
You know in your soul
When it's time to go
You know, you know, you know, you know
When it's time to go
So then you go
Then you go
You just go

"Fearless (Taylor's Version)"

There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly making me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this one-horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Oh, oh

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
Oh, yeah

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

Oh, oh
Oh-oh, yeah

"Fifteen (Taylor's Version)"

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

"Love Story (Taylor's Version)"

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go," and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"

Oh, oh

And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

"Hey Stephen (Taylor's Version)"

Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah

Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you? (Ha-ha-ha)

I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Ah-uh, myself
Mmm-mm, I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Oh-oh-oh
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm

"White Horse (Taylor's Version)"

Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

Maybe I was naÃ¯ve, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now

"You Belong With Me (Taylor's Version)"

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me

"Breathe (Taylor's Version)"
(feat. Colbie Caillat)

[Taylor Swift:]
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm

[Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat:]
The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
And nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh

I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Mmm)
I'm sorry, (Yeah, yeah) I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Ooh, ooh)
I'm sorry

"Tell Me Why (Taylor's Version)"

I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
Tell me why

Well, you could write a book on
How to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm tryin' to say, oh

I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
Tell me why

Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
Feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
Tell me why (Why)
Tell me why (Oh)

I take a step back, I let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know

"You're Not Sorry (Taylor's Version)"

All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh

You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now you're asking me to listen
'Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh

You had me crawling for you, honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Woah, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no

"The Way I Loved You (Taylor's Version)"

He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, "You look beautiful tonight."
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2 AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2 AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2 AM and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh

Whoa, whoa, oh-oh, oh
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

"Forever & Always (Taylor's Version)"

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always."
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always."

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always."
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always."
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always."
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said, "Forever and always."
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always."
You didn't mean it baby
You said, "Forever and always," yeah

"The Best Day (Taylor's Version)"

I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today

"Change (Taylor's Version)"

Well, it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this

'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

Tonight, we'll stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah

"Jump Then Fall (Taylor's Version)"

I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall

Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it o-over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me

'Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall

The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

Whoa oh, I need you, baby
Don't be afraid, please
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall, baby
Jump then fall into me, into me

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I shine
And every time you're here
Baby, I'll show you, I'll show you
You can jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah

"Untouchable (Taylor's Version)"

Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you

Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway

But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

I'm caught up in you
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, come on
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
And in the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, oh, come on, come on
Come on, come on, oh, oh, oh

It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
They're spelling out your name, oh

"Come In With The Rain (Taylor's Version)"

I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore

Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start

Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I've watched you so long, screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore

"Superstar (Taylor's Version)"

This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't keep my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

Morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

Sweet, sweet superstar
Superstar

"The Other Side Of The Door (Taylor's Version)"

In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignorin' words that you were sayin'
Tryna make me stay
I said, "This time I've had enough"
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up

'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone
Goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone
I keep goin' back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread

Oh, babe, if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah

I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, "There's nothing you can say
To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it"
But what I mean is

I said, "Leave," but, baby, all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you

"Today Was A Fairytale (Taylor's Version)"

Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around

Can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale

"You All Over Me (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"
(feat. Maren Morris)

[Taylor Swift:]
Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones, on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath
Reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off
It's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been
Reminds me of me

[Taylor Swift and Maren Morris:]
I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long
And wasted time, lost tears
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your "Don't you wish you had me?" grin
Well, I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then

And I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long
And wasted time, lost tears
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see, that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
I've still got you all over me
Still got you all over me

"Mr. Perfectly Fine (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

Mr. "Perfect face"
Mr. "Here to stay"
Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"
Everything was right
Mr. "I've been waiting for you all my life"
Mr. "Every single day until the end, I will be by your side"

But that was when I got to know Mr. "Change of heart"
Mr. "Leaves me all alone," I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay

Hello Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breaking mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Hello Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss "Misery" since your goodbye
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"

Mr. "Never told me why"
Mr. "Never had to see me cry"
Mr. "Insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy"
He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even heard my name
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same

'Cause I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl
I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her
And I never got past what you put me through
But it's wonderful to see that it never fazed you

Hello Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Hello Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss "Misery" since your goodbye
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"

So dignified in your well-pressed suit
So strategized, all the eyes on you
Sashay away to your seat
It's the best seat, in the best room
Oh, he's so smug, Mr. "Always wins"
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything

And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame
'Cause I was Miss "Here to stay"
Now I'm Miss "Gonna be alright someday"
And someday maybe you'll miss me
But by then, you'll be Mr. "Too late"

Goodbye Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Goodbye Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss "Misery" for the last time
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"
You're perfectly fine
Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"
You said you'd never go away

"We Were Happy (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night and we were happy
I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it
And we were happy

When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy

When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
We were happy

Oh, I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy, we were happy

When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
And we were happy
Yeah, we were happy
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We were happy

"That's When (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"
(feat. Keith Urban)

[Taylor Swift:]
You said, "I know"
When I said, "I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this"
You watched me go
And I knew my
Words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back
And I said, "When can I-I-I come back?"

[Taylor Swift and Keith Urban:]
And you said that's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when
Mm, mm

I said, "I know"
When you said, "I did you wrong
Made mistakes
And put you through all of this" (through all of this)
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said, "Leave those all in our past"
And you said, "When can I-I-I come back?"

And I said, that's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when"

[Taylor Swift:]
And you said, "Honestly
When you were gone
Did you ever think of me?"
And I said

[Taylor Swift with Keith Urban:]
"That's when, when I woke up in the morning
That's when, it was sunny or storming
Laughing when I was crying
And that's when, you were waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby, that's when"

That's when, when I wake up in the morning (Yeah)
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
When I'm laughing, when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
(That when I miss you, that's when I want you)
That's when, when I see your face
That's when I love you, that's when

"Don't You (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere
It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare
I heard she's nothin' like me
I'm sure she'll make you happy

But don't you
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

Ah, ah, ah, ah

Sometimes I really wish that I could hate you
I've tried, but that's just somethin' I can't do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldn't do this

But don't you
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

So I walk outta here tonight
Try to go on with my life
And you can say, "We're still friends"
I don't wanna pretend
So if I see you again

Don't you (Don't you)
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you (Don't you), say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't (You don't), know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Don't you, ah, ah, ah

"Bye Bye Baby (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
'Cause I, I still love you but I can't

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, baby

The picture frame is empty
On the dresser, vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation
I was so sure of everything
Everything I thought we'd always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye, bye, baby

And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Oh, you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, baby

"State Of Grace (Taylor's Version)"

I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room, and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same, oh
And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same
(So you were never a saint, and I loved in shades of wrong)
(We learn to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts)
(But this love is brave and wild)

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

"Red (Taylor's Version)"

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright, just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
But loving him was red
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)

Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
Oh, red (Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
Burning red (Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red

(Red, red, red; red, red, red)
Yeah, yeah, red
(Red, red, red; red, red, red)
Burning red (Red, red, red; red, red, red)
(Red, red, red; red, red, red)

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (Red, red, red; red, red, red)
Comes back to me (Red, red, red; red, red, red), burning red
(Red, red, red; red, red, red) Yeah, yeah
(Red, red, red; red, red, red)

His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street

"Treacherous (Taylor's Version)"

Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
All we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will
Get you a, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind and I just
Think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will
Get you a, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind and I just
Think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

"I Knew You Were Trouble (Taylor's Version)"

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey

I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh-oh (Yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Trouble)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything
Yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there)
So shame on me now (Knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Trouble)
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

"All Too Well (Taylor's Version)"

I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now

Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all, oh-oh-oh

'Cause there we are again on that
Little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were
Looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
You taught me about your past, thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Till you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well

And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

"22 (Taylor's Version)"

It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Ah, ah, ah, ah
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Ah ah, ah, ah
Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines, it's time
Ah, ah

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
22
22

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids ("Who is Taylor Swift anyway?")
Ah ah, ah ah
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping, yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks, it's time
Ah, ah

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if (Alright)
We just keep dancing like we're
22
22 (I don't know about you)
22
22

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me (You don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're 22
22
22 (Dancing like)
22
22

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

"I Almost Do (Taylor's Version)"

I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city and I bet
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost do, I almost do

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It's probably better off this way
And I confess, baby
In my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I'd want to try again with you
And I almost do

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost do, I almost do

I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city and I hope
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me

"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together (Taylor's Version)"

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough", 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space, what?
Then you come around again and say
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"

Ooh, we called it off again last night but
Ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight but
Ooh, this time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say never say never

So he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you"
And I'm like, I'm just, I mean this is exhausting you know?
Like we are never getting back together
Like, ever

(No)
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

(We)
No
(Getting back together)
(We)
(Getting back together)
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

"Stay Stay Stay (Taylor's Version)"

I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away but you stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, "Ok, let's talk"
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you
All the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you
For my whole life

Stay
And I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

That's so fun

"The Last Time (Taylor's Version)"
(feat. Gary Lightbody)

I find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I'm not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

You find yourself at my door
And just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

And right before your eyes
I'm aching
No past, nowhere to hide
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
This is the last time I say it's been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

This is the last time I'm asking you this
(This is the last time I'm asking you this)
Put my name at the top of your list
(Put my name at the top of your list)
This is the last time I'm asking you why
(This is the last time I'm asking you why)
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
(You break my heart)
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this

"Holy Ground (Taylor's Version)"

I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone
And Lord it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

And darling it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We block the noise with the sound of, "I need you"
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

"Sad Beautiful Tragic (Taylor's Version)"

Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
And we both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons
And darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair (Whoa, oh, whoa, oh)

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back
A beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful

What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

"The Lucky One (Taylor's Version)"

New to town with a made up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen

Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

Now, it's big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

'Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh

"Everything Has Changed (Taylor's Version)"
(feat. Ed Sheeran)

(You good to go?)

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

All I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

All I know is we said, "Hello"
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

"Starlight (Taylor's Version)"

I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picks me up late one night
Out the window, we were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, "Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way"
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

Like, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh-ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh-ooh, dancing with me
Ooh-ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight (Ooh, hoo, hoo)
Like we dream impossible dreams (Ooh, hoo, hoo)

Don't you see the starlight, starlight? (Ooh, hoo, hoo)
Don't you dream impossible things?

"Begin Again (Taylor's Version)"

Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song, but I do, I do

I walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafÃ©, I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy, but I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafÃ©, I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafÃ©, I watched it begin again

But on a Wednesday in a cafÃ©, I watched it begin again

"The Moment I Knew (Taylor's Version)"

You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that "Baby, I'm right here" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy

Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
"He said he'd be here"

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing (Missing)
And that was the moment I knew

What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
"Happy birthday to you"
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

You called me later
And said, "I'm sorry I didn't make it"
And I said, "I'm sorry, too"
And that was the moment I knew

"Come Back...Be Here (Taylor's Version)"

You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant

Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

This is falling in love in the cruellest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
But you're in London, and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around

This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

Oh-oh, oh-oh
I don't wanna miss you like this
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

"Girl At Home (Taylor's Version)"

Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that

I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This, I have previously learned

So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

I just wanna make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her

So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

Oh-oh
Oh-oh

Call a cab, lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab, lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned

Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn't once been just like her

"State Of Grace (Acoustic Version) (Taylor's Version)"

I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time

And I never
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

I never
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same, oh

Oh, I never
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

"Ronan (Taylor's Version)"

I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me, waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

"Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years"

I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming "Why?"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

"Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray, we'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years"

What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back

"Nothing New (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"
(feat. Phoebe Bridgers)

They tell you while you're young
"Girls, go out and have your fun"
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly
When you're soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say, "She looks like she's been through it"
Lord, what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty?

I've had too much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new?

How long will it be cute, all this crying in my room?
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention
And someone else lights up the room?
People love an ingÃ©nue

I've had too much to drink tonight
How did I go from growing up to breaking down?
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new?

I know someday I'm gonna meet her
It's a fever dream
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me
I'll say I'm happy for her then I'll cry myself to sleep
Oh woah, oh woah, oh, oh

I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out
I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
And I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me, will you still want me
Will you still want me when I'm nothing new?

"Message In A Bottle (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

I know that you like me
And it's kinda frightening
Standing here waiting, waiting
And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes
Tongue tied
But, now, you're so far away and I'm down
Feeling like a face in the crowd
I'm reaching for you, terrified

'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
And I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you

These days I'm restless
Workdays are endless
Look how you made me, made me
But time moves faster
Replaying your laughter
Disaster

'Cause, now, you're so far away and I'm down
Feeling like a face in the crowd
I'm reaching for you, terrified

'Cause you could be the one that I love
And I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
And I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you

How is it in London? (London)
Where were you while I'm wondering (Wondering)
If I'll ever see you again?

You could be the one that I love
And, now, I'm standing here hoping it gets to you

'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
And I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you

You could be the one that I love
You could be the one that I love
My love
And, now, I'm standing here hoping this gets to you

"I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"
(feat. Chris Stapleton)

3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh

Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of

But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills

But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

Mr. Superior Thinkin'
Do you have all the space that you need?
I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy
And I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

Oh, block it all out
The voices so loud, sayin'
"Why did you let her go?"
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that you're lookin' for
Is the love that you had?

Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me

But now that we're done and it's over
I bet it's hard to believe
That it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And, yeah, I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me when you're out
At your cool indie music concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch
I bet you think about me when you say
"Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me"
I bet you think about me

"Forever Winter (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
He says, "Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?"
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity
I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 3 A.M., pacing
He says, "It's not just a phase I'm in"
My voice comes out begging

All this time I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

He seems fine most of the time
Forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony
When the lights go out, it's hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead
I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 5 A.M., wasted
Long gone, not even listening
My voice comes out screaming

All this time I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

If I was standing there in your apartment
I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it
I'd say I love you even at your darkest and
Please don't go

I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you werenât around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

I'll be your summer sun forever
At 3 A.M., pacing
All this time I didn't know
At 5 A.M., wasted
I'd be in pieces on the floor
Forever winter if you go

He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
I say, "Believe in one thing, I won't go away"

"Run (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"
(feat. Ed Sheeran)

One, two, three, four

Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around
We shouldn't be in this town
And my so-called friends, they don't know
I'd drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
There's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote
"I'll wait for you"
There's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame
Take it with you

And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run

So you laugh like a child
And I'll sing like no one cares
No one to be, no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
There's a heart on your sleeve
I'll take it when I leave
And hold it for you

And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all
We can go like they're trying to chase us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run

There's been this hole in my heart
This thing was a shot in the dark
Say you'll never let 'em tear us apart
And I'll hold onto you while we run (And we run, and we run, and we run)

Like you'd run from the law (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Darling, let's run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Run from it all (And we run, and we run, and we run)
We can go where our eyes can take us (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Go where no one else is, run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, and we'll run

"The Very First Night (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

And so it goes
Every weekend, this same party
I never go alone and I don't seem brokenhearted
My friends all say they know everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you
'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't riding in the car when we both fell
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you

I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

And so it was
We never saw it coming
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back then we didn't know we were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo, then we broke each other's hearts
But don't forget about the night out in LA
Danced in the kitchen, chased me down through the hallway
No one knows about the words that we whispered
No one knows how much I miss you

I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you

I remember the night at the hotel
I was riding in the car when we both fell
I'm the one on the phone as you whisper
"Do you know how much I miss you?"
I wish that we could go back in time
And I'd say to you
"I miss you like it was the very first night"

I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you

"All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "fuck the patriarchy"
Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come
And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes
"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you, too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it

"A Message From Taylor"

Musically and lyrically, Red resembled a heart-broken person
It was all over the place
A fractured mosaic of feelings that somehow all fit together in the end
Happy, free, confused, lonely, devastated, euphoric, wild
And tortured by memories past
These are the original thirty songs that were meant for Red
I love you guys

"Lavender Haze"

Meet me at midnight
Ooh ooh ooh whoa

Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia
I've been under scrutiny (Yeah, oh yeah)
You handle it beautifully (Yeah, oh yeah)
All this shit is new to me (Yeah, oh yeah)

I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s' shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
Ooh ooh ooh whoa

All they keep asking me
(All they keep asking me)
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see
(Only kinda girl they see)
Is a one-night or a wife
I find it dizzying (Yeah, oh yeah)
They're bringing up my history (Yeah, oh yeah)
But you weren't even listening (Yeah, oh yeah)

I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s' shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
That lavender haze

Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
(Get it off my desk)

Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk

I feel (I feel) the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal (No deal)
The 1950s' shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

Ooh ooh ooh whoa
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
That lavender haze
I just wanna stay
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

"Maroon"

When the morning came, we
Were cleaning incense off your
Vinyl shelf 'cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
"How'd we end up on the floor anyway?"
You say
"Your roommate's cheap-ass screw top rosÃ©
That's how"
I see you every day now

And I chose you
The one I was dancing with in New York
No shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

When the silence came, we
Were shaking blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses
That's us
I feel you, no matter what
The rubies that I gave up

And I lost you
The one I was dancing with in New York
No shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was maroon
The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fuckin' legacy, legacy
(It was maroon)
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fuckin' legacy to leave

The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet
It was maroon
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

It was maroon
It was maroon

"Anti-Hero"

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism
I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
"She's laughing up at us from Hell"

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees

It's me, hi (Hi), I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

"Snow On The Beach"
(feat. Lana Del Rey)

One night a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you

And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, oh

This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched 'aurora borealis green'
I've never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it till you make it
Till you do
Till it's true

Now it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, oh

I can't speak, afraid to jinx it
I don't even dare to wish it
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
Now I'm all for you like Janet
Can this be a real thing, can it?

Are we falling like
Snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around

Like snow on the beach
(It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)
Like snow on the beach
(It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)
(It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)
(Down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)

"You're On Your Own, Kid"

Summer went away
Still the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently
He's gonna notice me
It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway

I hear it in your voice
You're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town
I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

I see the great escape
So long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed
Writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid

You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

"Midnight Rain"

Rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice

He was sunshine
I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away

'Cause he was sunshine
I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

Rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except when I'm on TV
I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this
Midnights like this

"Question...?"

(I remember)

Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices
We had one thing going on
I swear that it was something
'Cause I don't remember who I was before you
Painted all my nights
A color I have searched for since
But one thing after another
Fuckin' situations, circumstances
Miscommunications and I
Have to say
By the way
I just may like some explanations

Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question

Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize out of time?
She was on your mind
With some dickhead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on something
It was one drink after another
Fuckin' politics and gender roles
And you're not sure and I don't know
Got swept away in the gray
I just may like to have a conversation

Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question

Does it feel like everything's just like second best after that meteor strike?
And what's that that I heard, that you're still with her?
That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable
And right
But tonight

Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?)
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room? (In a crowded room)
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you (You, making fun of you)
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question

"Vigilante Shit"

Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them
Sometimes I wonder which one will be your last lie
They say looks can kill and I might try
I don't dress for women
I don't dress for men
Lately I've been dressing for revenge

I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately I've been dressing for revenge

She needed cold hard proof so I gave her some
She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?
Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife
And she looks so pretty
Driving in your Benz
Lately she's been dressing for revenge

She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
She don't dress for friends
Lately she's been dressing for revenge

Ladies always rise above
Ladies know what people want
Someone sweet and kind and fun
The lady simply had enough
While he was doing lines
And crossing all of mine
Someone told his white collar crimes to the FBI
And I don't dress for villains
Or for innocents
I'm on my vigilante shit again

I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately I've been dressing for revenge

"Bejeweled"

Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walking all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Putting someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way
I'm going out tonight

Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, "Do you have a man?"
I could still say, "I don't remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real
I polish up real nice
Nice

Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl
Too good of a girl
Did all the extra credit then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world
Have you heard?
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you
But I miss sparkling

(Nice) Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, "Do you have a man?"
I could still say, "I don't remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real
I polish up real nice
Nice

Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my aura's moonstone
Just 'cause he was high
And we're dancing all night
And you can try
To change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do?
A diamond's gotta shine

Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, "Do you have a man?"
I could still say, "I don't remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real (Nice)
I polish up real nice

And we're dancing all night
And you can try
To change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do?
What's a girl gonna do?
I polish up nice
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer

"Labyrinth"

It only hurts this much right now
Was what I was thinking the whole time
Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out
I'll be getting over you my whole life
You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
It can't last

Uh oh, I'm falling in love
Oh no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around?

It only feels this raw right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
Break up, break free, break through, break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile
You know how much I hate
That everybody just expects me to bounce back
Just like that

Uh oh, I'm falling in love
Oh no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around?

Uh oh, I'm falling in love
Oh no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around?

Uh oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
Oh no, I'm falling in love again (falling in love again)
Oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around?

Uh oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
Oh no, I'm falling in love again (falling in love again)
Oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around?

(You know how much I hate it)
(You know how much I hate it)
(You know how much I hate it)

"Karma"

You're talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around

And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Spiderboy, king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?
It's coming back around

And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here
(I'm still here, I'm still here)

'Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma's gonna track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me

'Cause karma is my boyfriend (Karma is my boyfriend)
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (Weekend)
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god (Ah)
Uh-huh, mm
Karma's a relaxing thought

"Sweet Nothing"

I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh
Ooh

They said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings

Outside, they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
Sweet nothing

On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, "What a mind"
This happens all the time
Ooh
Ooh

'Cause they said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings

Outside they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
Nothing

Industry disrupters and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters
Out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore
"You should be doing more"
To you I can admit
That I'm just too soft for all of it
Ooh

They said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings

Outside, they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
Sweet nothing

They said the end is coming (They said the end is coming)
Everyone's up to something (Everyone's up to something)
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings

Outside, they're push and shoving (Outside, they're push and shoving)
You're in the kitchen humming (You're in the kitchen humming)
All that you ever wanted from me was
Sweet nothing

"Mastermind"

Once upon a time, the planets and the fates and all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room at the same time
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose

What if I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me, nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork and then just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all by design
'Cause I'm a mastermind

You see all the wisest women had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be the pawn in every lover's game
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails

What if I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me, I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork and then just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all my design
'Cause I'm a mastermind

No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless
This is the first time I've felt the need to confess
And I swear
I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian 'cause I care

So I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me, nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork and then saw a wide smirk
On your face, you knew the entire time
You knew that I'm a mastermind
And now you're mine
Yeah, all you did was smile
'Cause I'm a mastermind

"Hits Different"

I washed my hands of us at the club
You made a mess of me
I pictured you with other girls in love
Then threw up on the street
Like waiting for a bus that never shows
You just start walkin' on
They say that if it's right, you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different 'cause it's you

('Cause it's you)

I used to switch out these Kens, I'd just ghost
Rip the band-aid off and skip town like an asshole outlaw
Freedom felt like summer then on the coast
Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings
And I never don't cry (And I never don't cry) at the bar
Yeah, my sadness is contagious (My sadness is contagious)
I slur your name 'til someone puts me in a car
I stopped receiving invitations

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different 'cause it's you

('Cause it's you)

I find the artifacts, cried over a hat
Cursed the space that I needed
I trace the evidence, make it make some sense
Why the wound is still bleedin'
You were the one that I loved
Don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough
A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes
This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy
Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief
In the good in the world, you once believed in me
And I felt you and I held you for a while
Bet I could still melt your world
Argumentative, antithetical dream girl

I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway
Is that your key in the door?
Is it okay? Is it you?
Or have they come to take me away?
To take me away

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different (It hits different)
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different (It hits different)
It hits different 'cause it's you

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
'Cause it's you
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different (Yeah)
It hits different 'cause it's you

"You're On Your Own, Kid (Strings Remix)"

Summer went away, still, the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me
It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared

You're on your own, kid
You always have been

I see the great escape, so long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed, writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare

You're on your own, kid
You always have been

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid

You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

"Sweet Nothing (Piano Remix)"

I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly, a pebble
That we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh, ooh

They said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I found myself a-running home to your sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing

On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, "What a mind"
This happens all the time
Ooh, ooh

'Cause they said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I found myself a-running home to your sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was nothing

Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore, "You should be doing more"
To you, I can't admit that I'm just too soft for all of it
Ooh

They said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I found myself a-running home to your sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing
They said the end is coming
(They said the end is coming)
Everyone's up to something

I found myself a-running home to your sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shoving
(Outside they're push and shoving)
You're in the kitchen humming
(You're in the kitchen humming)
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing

"Meet Me At Midnight"

Hey Apple Music, this is Taylor Swift
Midnights tells the stories of thirteen sleepless nights scattered throughout my life
I hope you like it and, wherever you are, you'll meet me at midnight

"The Great War"

My knuckles were bruised like violets
Sucker punching walls
Cursed you as I sleep talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down
Took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur

All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember, uh-huh
Tears on the letter, I vowed
Not to cry anymore
If we survived the Great War

You drew up some good faith treaties
I drew curtains closed
Drank my poison all alone
You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire
You were playing with fire
And maybe it's the past that's talking
Screaming from the crypt
Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it

All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the bombs were closer
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember, uh-huh
The burning embers, I vowed
Not to fight anymore
If we survived the Great War
Uh-huh, uh-huh

It turned into something bigger
Somewhere in the haze
Got a sense I'd been betrayed
Your finger on my hairpin triggers
Soldier down on that icy ground
Looked up at me with honor and truth
Broken and blue
So I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought I'd lost you

We can plant a memory garden
Say a solemn prayer
Place a poppy in my hair
There's no morning glory
It was war, it wasn't fair
And we will never go back to that

Bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the worst was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember, uh-huh
We're burned for better, I vowed
I would always be yours
'Cause we survived the Great War
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I will always be yours
'Cause we survived the Great War
Uh-huh
I vowed I will always be yours

"Bigger Than The Whole Sky"

No words appear before me in the aftermath
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears
Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness
'Cause it's all over now, all out to sea

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you
What could've been, would've been you

Did some bird flap its wings over in Asia?
Did some force take you because I didn't pray?
Every single thing to come has turned into ashes
'Cause it's all over, it's not meant to be
So I'll say words I don't believe

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you

What could've been, would've been you
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you
What could've been, would've been you
(What could've been, would've been you)

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you

"Paris"

"Your ex-friend's sister
Met someone at a club and he kissed her
Turns out, it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago
Some wannabe Z-lister
And all the outfits were terrible
2003 unbearable
Did you see the photos?"
No, I didn't, but thanks, though

I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
Stumbled down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne
I was taken by the view

Like we were in Paris
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else

Privacy sign on the door
And on my page and on the whole world
Romance is not dead if you keep it just yours
Levitate above all the messes made
Sit quiet by my side in the shade
And not the kind that's thrown
I mean, the kind under where a tree has grown

I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
Stumbled down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne
I was taken by the view

Like we were in Paris, oh
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else

I wanna brainwash you
Into loving me forever
I wanna transport you
To somewhere the culture's clever
Confess my truth
In swooping, sloping, cursive letters
Let the only flashing lights be the tower at midnight
In my mind

We drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
In an alleyway, drinking champagne

'Cause we were in Paris
Yes, we were somewhere else
My love, we were in Paris
Yes, we were somewhere else

"High Infidelity"

Lock broken
Slur spoken
Wound open
Game token
I didn't know you were keeping count
Rain soaking
Blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
I didn't know you were keeping count

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it

Do you really want to know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?

Storm coming
Good husband
Bad omen
Dragged my feet right down the aisle
At the house lonely
Good money
I'd pay, if you'd just know me
Seemed like the right thing at the time

You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough
Do you really want to know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to tell you how he brought me back to life?

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it

High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it

Do you really want to know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?
You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret meeting me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it

High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it

Oh, there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
And it's never enough, it's never enough

Lock broken
Slur spoken
Wound open
Game token
I didn't know you were keeping count
Rain soaking
Blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
I didn't know you were keeping count
But, oh, you were keeping count

"Glitch"

We were supposed to be just friends
You don't live in my part of town but maybe I'll see you out some weekend
Depending on what kind of mood and situation-ship I'm in
And what's in my system

I think there's been a glitch, ah-yeah
Five seconds later I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, ah-yeah
And I'm not even sorry
Nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch, ah-yeah

I was supposed to sweat you out
In search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone else's playground
But it's been 2,190 days of our love blackout
(Our love is blacking out)
The system's breaking down
(The system's breaking down)

I think there's been a glitch, ah-yeah
Five seconds later I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, ah-yeah
And I'm not even sorry
Nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch, ah-yeah

A brief interruption
A slight malfunction
I'd go back to wanting
Dudes who give nothing
I thought we had no chance
And that's romance
Let's dance

Glitch, ah-yeah
Five seconds later I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, ah-yeah
And I'm not even sorry
Nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch

"Would've, Could've, Should've"

If you would've blinked, then I would've
Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison you could've
Spit me out at the first chance
If I was some paint, did it splatter
On a promising grown man?
And if I was a child, did it matter
If you got to wash your hands?
Oh, all I used to do was pray
Would've, could've, should've
If you'd never looked my way

I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen, and the god's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know
I wish you'd left me wondering

If you never touched me I would've
Gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed then they could've
Never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom
I could've gone on as I was
But, lord, you made me feel important
And then you tried to erase us
Oh, you're a crisis of my faith
Would've, could've, should've
If I'd only played it safe

I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen, and the god's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know
I wish you'd left me wondering

God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time

If clarity's in death, then why won't this die?
Years of tearing down our banners, you and I
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts
Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first

And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen, and the god's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know
I wish you'd left me wondering

God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time

Oh, god rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time

"Dear Reader"

Dear reader, if it feels like a trap
You're already in one
Dear reader, get out your map
Pick somewhere and just run
Dear reader, burn all the files
Desert all your past lives
And if you don't recognize yourself
That means you did it right

Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart (You should find another)

Dear reader, bend when you can
Snap when you have to
Dear reader, you don't have to answer
Just 'cause they asked you
(You should find another)
Dear reader, the greatest of luxuries is your secrets
Dear reader, when you aim at the devil
Make sure you don't miss

Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart

So I wander through these nights
I prefer hiding in plain sight
My fourth drink in my hand
These desperate prayers of a cursed man
Spilling out to you for free
But darling, darling, please
You wouldn't take my word for it if you knew who was talking
If you knew where I was walking
To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there
Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care
No one sees when you lose when you're playing solitaire

You should find another guiding light, guiding light
But I shine so bright
You should find another guiding light, guiding light
But I shine so bright
You should find another, you should find another (Guiding light)
Find another, you should find another
You should find another

"Snow On The Beach (Remix)"
(feat. Lana Del Rey)

One night a few moons ago I
Saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you

And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah

This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched 'aurora borealis green'
I've never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it
'Til you do
'Til it's true

Now it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah

I can't speak, afraid to jinx it
I, can't
I don't even dare to wish it
I, don't
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
Now I'm all for you like Janet
Can this be a real thing, can it?

Are we falling like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah
It's coming down, no sound, it's all around

Like snow on the beach
Like snow, like snow, ah yeah

"Karma (Remix)"
(feat. Ice Spice)

Karma is that girl like (Grah)

You're talking shit
For the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal
But you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare
You'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a God
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey
Karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Karma is ya checks 'boutta bounce (Damn)
Karma is a fire in ya house (Grah)
And she 'boutta pop up unannounced (Like)
And she never leaving you alone (Damn)
Watch her put ya opps on a throne (Damn)
Got you waving pretty white flags

Thinking it'll save ya
Now you switching up ya behavior
It's okay, baby
You ain't gotta worry, karma never gets lazy
So I keep my head up, my bread up, I won't let up (Never)

Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey
Karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that (Grah)

Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade but I'm still here
I'm still here
I'm still here

'Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
And karma's gonna track you down
Step by step from town to town
Sweet like justice

Karma takes all my friends to the summit (Facts)
Karma is the guy on the screen coming straight home to me

Me and karma vibe like that

Karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a God
Karma is my bestie
Karma's a relaxing thought...
Karma's gonna hold you down

"You're Losing Me (From The Vault)"

You say, "I don't understand" and I say, "I know you don't"
We thought a cure would come through in time, now, I fear it won't
Remember lookin' at this room, we loved it 'cause of the light
Now, I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time

Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?
I'm getting tired even for a phoenix
Always risin' from the ashes
Mendin' all her gashes
You might just have dealt the final blow

Stop, you're losing me
Stop, you're losing me
Stop, you're losing me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore... for you
'Cause you're losing me

Every mornin' I glared at you with storms in my eyes
How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin'?
I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick
My face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick

And the air is thick with loss and indecision
I know my pain is such an imposition
Now, you're running down the hallway
And you know what they all say
"You don't know what you got until it's gone"

Stop, you're losing me
Stop, you're losing me
Stop, you're losing me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore... for you
'Cause you're losing me
'Cause you're losing me
Stop (Stay) 'cause you're losing me

My heart won't start anymore (Stop 'cause you're losing me)
My heart won't start anymore (Stop 'cause you're losing me)

How long could we be a sad song
'Til we were too far gone to bring back to life?
I gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy
And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier
Fighting in only your army, frontlines, don't you ignore me
I'm the best thing at this party (You're losing me)
And I wouldn't marry me either
A pathological people pleaser
Who only wanted you to see her
And I'm fading, thinkin'
"Do something, babe, say something" (Say something)
"Lose something, babe, risk something" (You're losing me)
"Choose something, babe, I got nothing" (I got nothing)
"To believe, unless you're choosing me"

You're losing me
Stop (Stop, stop), you're losing me
Stop (Stop, stop), you're losing me
I can't find a pulse, my heart won't start anymore

"Mine (Taylor's Version)"

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

You were in college working part-time, waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Oh-oh, oh

And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
As everything was slippin' right out of our hands
I ran out cryin' and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone"

You said, "I remember how it felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine"

Hold on and make it last
Hold on, never turn back
(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Yes, yes, do you believe it? (Hold on)
Yes, yes, we're gonna make it now (Hold on, yeah)
Yes, yes, and I can see it (Hold on)
Yes, yes, I can see it now (See it now, see it now)

"Sparks Fly (Taylor's Version)"

The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of

Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really somethin'
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you, I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would

Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show

Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly

"Back To December (Taylor's Version)"

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughin' from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

All the time

"Speak Now (Taylor's Version)"

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don't you?

Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
Don't say yes, run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow)
Your time is running out
And they said, "Speak now"

Ooh (Run away now), la
Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh

I hear the preacher say
"Speak now or forever hold your peace"
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only lookin' at you

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha

So, don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
They said, "Speak now"
And you say, "Let's run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when I'm out
Of my tux, at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow)
So glad you were around
When they said, 'Speak now'"

"Dear John (Taylor's Version)"

Long were the nights
When my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Prayin' the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losin' my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back to turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you change the rules every day
Wonderin' which version of you
I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up
And this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda known

Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said
"Run as fast as you can"

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by
Your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
I shoulda known

You are an expert at "Sorry" and keepin' lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town
Oh

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You shoulda known

You shoulda known
Don't you think I was too young?
You shoulda known

"Mean (Taylor's Version)"

You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man

Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big, loud opinion but nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumblin' on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean

All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic
And alone in life, and mean
And mean, and mean, and mean

But someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

"The Story Of Us (Taylor's Version)"

I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now I'm searchin' the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Next chapter

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and tryin' to look busy
And you're doin' your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losin' my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothin'?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love than fight

So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me? Yeah
And I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'Cause we're goin' down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

The end

"Never Grow Up (Taylor's Version)"

Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favourite nightlight

To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up

Never grow up

You're in the car, on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots

But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's gettin' older, too
And don't lose the way that you dance around
In your PJs getting ready for school

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is, someday, gonna be gone

So, here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, I could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, it could still be simple
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you (Never grow up)
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please, try to never grow up

Oh, oh (Never grow up)
Don't you ever grow up
Oh (Never grow up)
Just never grow up

"Enchanted (Taylor's Version)"

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
"Hey, it was enchanting to meet you"
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you (Oh-oh)

This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't have somebody waiting on you)
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you

"Better Than Revenge (Taylor's Version)"

Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say "Sabotage"
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
Woah, woah-ah-oh

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah (She deserved it)
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)
Come on, show me how much better you are
(So much better, yeah?)
See, you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say "Sabotage"

"Innocent (Taylor's Version)"

I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night, you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, and life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up, too, ooh
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new, oh

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, and life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh
It's never too late to get it back

"Haunted (Taylor's Version)"

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

Oh, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead

Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I know, I know
I just know
You're not gone
You can't be gone, no

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
I can't go back, I'm haunted

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it

"Last Kiss (Taylor's Version)"

I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
Away

I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, mm-hmm

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So, I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last

"Long Live (Taylor's Version)"

I said, "Remember this moment"
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives would
Never be the same
You held your head like a hero on a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

I said, "Remember this feeling"
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd"
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans
Got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, "Long live that look on your face"
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment? Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing, "Long live all the mountains we moved"
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

"Ours (Taylor's Version)"

Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
And you'll say

Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

"Superman (Taylor's Version)"

Tall, dark, and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yay
And you smile and say, "How are you?"
And I'll say, "Just fine"
I always forget to tell you, I love you
I love you forever

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away, and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say
And you'll leave, got places to be, and I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away, but I never let you go
I'm love-struck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be

Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
'Cause I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
Forever and ever
And I watch superman fly away
I swear, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
When you come back down

"Electric Touch (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"
(feat. Patrick Stump)

Just breathe, just relax, it'll be okay
Just an hour 'til your car's in the driveway
Just the first time ever hangin' out with you tonight
I've got my money on things goin' badly
Got a history of stories ending sadly
Still hoping that the fire won't burn me
Just one time, just one time

All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm

I've been left in the rain lost and pining
I'm tryin' hard not to look like I'm trying
'Cause every time I tried hard for love, it fell apart (Woah)
I've gotten used to no one callin' my phone
I've grown accustomed to sleepin' alone
Still, I know that all it takes is to get it right
Just one time, just one time

All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm

I was thinking just one time (Just one time)
Maybe the stars align (Just one time)
And maybe I call you mine
And you won't need space
Or string me along while you decide
And just one time (Just one time)
Maybe the moment's right (The moment's right)
It's 8:05 and I see two headlights

All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch (Ooh)
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life (Life)
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm

"When Emma Falls in Love (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

When Emma falls in love, she paces the floor
Closes the blinds and locks the door
When Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom
Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong
She waits and takes her time
'Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain
When Emma falls in love, I know
That boy will never be the same

'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her

When Emma falls in love, it's all on her face
Hangs in the air like stars in outer space
When Emma falls in love, she disappears
And we all just laugh after seein' it all these years
When Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone
She takes on the pain and bears it on her own
'Cause when Emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps
She won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave

And she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her

Well, she's so New York when she's in L.A
She won't lose herself in love the way that I did
'Cause she'll call you out, she'll put you in your place
When Emma falls in love, I'm learning

Emma met a boy with eyes like a man
Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand
Now he'll be her shelter when it rains
Little does he know, his whole world's about to change

'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her

Yeah, between me and you, sometimes I wish I was her

"I Can See You (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

Uh-uh, uh, uh

You brush past me in the hallway
And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?
I've been watchin' you for ages
And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it

But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?

'Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you

Uh-uh, uh, uh

And we kept everything professional
But something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like
They keep watchful eyes on us
So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet
You won't believe half the things I see inside my head
Wait 'til you see half the things that haven't happened yet

But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?

'Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh, oh, oh
That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor
I could see you, make me want you even more
What would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you

Uh-uh, uh, uh

I can see you in your suit and your necktie
Passed me a note saying, "Meet me tonight"
Then we kissed and you know I won't ever tell, yeah
And I could see you being my addiction
You can see me as a secret mission
Hide away and I will start behaving myself

Uh-uh, uh, uh
Oh-oh, oh, oh

I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh
That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor
I could see you, make me want you even more
What would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you, oh, I can see you

Oh, I see you, I see you, baby
I see you
(Uh-uh, uh, uh) I see you, I see you, baby
Oh, baby

"Castles Crumbling (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"
(feat. Hayley Williams)

(Once, I had an empire)
(Once, I had an empire)
(Once, I had an empire)

Once, I had an empire in a golden age
I was held up so high, I used to be great
They used to cheer when they saw my face
Now, I fear I have fallen from grace

And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
You don't wanna know me now

Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty
Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me
Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far
I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart

Power went to my head and I couldn't stop
Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off
And here I sit alone behind walls of regret
Falling down like promises that I never kept

And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
You don't wanna know me now

My foes and friends watch my reign end
I don't know how it could've ended this way
Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor
People look at me like I'm a monster
Now they're screamin' at the palace's front gates
Used to chant my name
Now they're screaming that they hate me
Never wanted you to hate me

My castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down (Just let you down)
My castle's crumbling down
You don't wanna know me now, now

(Once, I had an empire)
(Once, I had an empire)
(Once, I had an empire)

"Foolish One (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

My cards are on the table, yours are in your hand
Chances are, tonight, you've already got plans
And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again
You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high
Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right
And I will block out these voices of reason in my head

And the voices say, "You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson"

Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down

You know how to keep me waitin'
I know how to act like I'm fine
Don't know what to call this situation
But I know I can't call you mine
And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof
'Cause when my head is on your shoulder
It starts thinkin' you'll come around
And maybe, someday, when we're older
This is something we'll laugh about
Over coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news

But then the voices say, "You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson"

Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out

Now I'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands
Sayin', "How could I not see the signs?"
Oh, you haven't written me or called
But goodbye screamin' in the silence
And the voices in my head are tellin' me why
'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings
I'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring
And you will say you had the best of intentions
And maybe I will finally learn my lesson

Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out, oh-oh, oh, oh

La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, oh
La-la-la-la-la
Ain't never gonna come
Ooh, you will learn the hard way now
Foolish one
Sittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love
They ain't never gonna come
And thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out
Foolish one
The day is gonna come for your confessions of love
When all is said and done, he just wasn't the one
No, he just wasn't the one

"Timeless (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

Down the block, there's an antique shop
And something in my head said, "Stop," so I walked in
On the counter was a cardboard box
And the sign said, "Photos: twenty-five cents each"
Black and white, saw a '30s bride
And school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house
The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
The kind you don't put down
And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain
But in those photos, I saw us instead
And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other
In another life, you still would've turned my head even if we'd met

On a crowded street in 1944
And you were headed off to fight in the war
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right
And you would've been fine
We would have been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless

I had to smile when it caught my eye
There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway
Holdin' hands on the way to a dance
And the date on the back said 1958
Which brought me back to the first time I saw you
Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop
I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round
At these precious things that time forgot
That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs
Story of a romance torn apart by fate
Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did
And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face

In the fifteen hundreds off in a foreign land
And I was forced to marry another man
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And run away and left it all behind
You still would've been mine
We would've been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless

Time breaks down your mind and body
Don't you let it touch your soul
It was like an age-old classic
The first time that you saw me
The story started when you said, "Hello"

In a crowded room a few short years ago
And sometimes there's no proof, you just know
You're always gonna be mine
We're gonna be
I'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' gray
We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made
And you'll say, "Oh my, we really were timeless"

We're gonna be timeless, timeless
You still would've been mine
We would've been
Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944
You still would've been mine
We would've been

Down the block, there's an antique shop
And somethin' in my head said, "Stop," so I walked in

"Welcome To New York (Taylor's Version)"

Walkin' through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat forever more
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat forever more
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me

Welcome to New York (New York)
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change
Anything, anything, anything

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me (Welcome to New York)

New soundtrack
It's been waiting for you (Welcome to New York)
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me (Welcome to New York)
So bright they never blind me (Welcome to New York)
Welcome to New York

"Blank Space (Taylor's Version)"

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"

Aye, new money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me, so hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mmm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second-guessin' like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mmm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Ooh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mmm (Oh)
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mmm (Over)
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far (Ooh)
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar (Leave a nasty scar)
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

"Style (Taylor's Version)"

Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you (Heard from you)

I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home
Lights are off, he's takin' off his coat, mmm, yeah
I say, "I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl
Some other girl"

He says, "What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinking 'bout you and I"
I said, "I've been there too a few times"

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (A tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go)
We never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah, just take me home, oh (Out of style)

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

"Out Of The Woods (Taylor's Version)"

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember

And you took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods?

Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
And fall back together (Back together)

Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods?

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you

Remember when you couldn't take the heat
I walked out, I said, "I'm setting you free"
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, oh
You were looking at me

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods? (I remember)
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good (Oh, I remember)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Yeah)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (Are we?)
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah, yeah)
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good (Do you remember?)

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good

"All You Had To Do Was Stay (Taylor's Version)"

People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road (Stay)

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in? (Stay)
Hey, now you say you want it
Back, now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Here you are now, callin' me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been pickin' up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye (Stay)

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in? (Stay)
Hey, now you say you want it
Back, now that it's just too late

You were all I wanted (But not like this)
Not like this, not like this
Oh, all you had to do was (Stay)

Had me in the palm of your hand then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in? (Stay)

"Shake It Off (Taylor's Version)"

I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make 'em stay
At least, that's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

"I Wish You Would (Taylor's Version)"

It's 2:00 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now 'cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

It's 2:00 AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide, and it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for, and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish, I wish, I

2:00 AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide, but it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for, and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would
I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would
I, I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I wish you would

"Bad Blood (Taylor's Version)"

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shiny? Now it's all rusted

Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe and
Rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So, don't think it's in the past
These kinds of wounds they last, and they last

Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't
So if you're coming my way
Just don't

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (Ghosts)
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts, mmm
If you love like that
Blood runs cold

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we got bad blood, hey (Bad blood, bad blood)
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (Think we can solve 'em)
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we got bad blood

You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done (Look what you've done)

"Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)"

He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request it is

Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ha, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' (Burnin') it (It) down (Down)
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow (Follow) you (You) around (Around)

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (Just pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ah-ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
Even if it's just in your
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha

"How You Get The Girl (Taylor's Version)"

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Stand there like a ghost, shaking from the rain, rain
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane-ane?"
Say it's been a long six months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want

And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And then, you say

I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
Oh-oh

"This Love (Taylor's Version)"

Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

In silent screams, in wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh
Oh, oh

Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind for only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone

In losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh

(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love)

Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young, you just run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh
(This love) This love left a permanent mark
(This love) This love is glowing in the dark, oh
(This love) These hands had to let it go free, and
(This love) This love came back to me, oh

(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love)
(This love) This love came back to me, oh

"I Know Places (Taylor's Version)"

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling, dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They take their shots, but we're bulletproof (I, I know places)
And you know for me, it's always you (Hide, I know places)
In the dead of night, your eyes so green (I, I know places)
And I know for you, it's always me (Hide, I know places)
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I

"Clean (Taylor's Version)"

The drought was the very worst
Ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months, and months of back and forth
Ah-ah, ah-ah
You're still all over me
Like a wine stained dress I can't wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do
Ah-ah, ah-ah
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
I think I am finally clean
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Said, I think I am finally clean
Ah-ah-ah

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst
Ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

The rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Think I'm finally clean

"Wonderland (Taylor's Version)"

Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn, and we
Fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control

Didn't they tell us "Don't rush into things"?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should've slept with one eye open at night

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh-eh
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better, eh-eh

Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone, or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams, oh

Didn't they tell us "Don't rush into things"?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire Cat smile?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games till somebody loses their mind
Oh, darling

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh-eh
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better, eh-eh

Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland
Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh, in Wonderland

I reached for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in Wonderland we both went mad, oh

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh-eh (Could last forever)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better, eh-eh (Never better)

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it (In Wonderland)
And we pretended it could last forever (In Wonderland)
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it (In Wonderland)
And life was never worse but never better (In Wonderland)

"You Are In Love (Taylor's Version)"

One look, dark room meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you played it back
Buttons on a coat, light-hearted joke
No proof, not much, but you saw enough

Small talk, he drives, coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says, "Look up," and your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You, you can feel it on the way home, way home
You, you can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

Morning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word
And for once, you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough

You kiss on sidewalks, you fight then you talk
One night, he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says, "You're my best friend"
And you knew what it was, he is in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You, you can feel it on the way home, way home
You, you can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love

You are in love
And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, 'round and 'round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now why
They lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You, you can feel it on the way home, way home
You, you can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence
You, you can feel it on the way home, way home
You, you can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

"New Romantics (Taylor's Version)"

We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my ace

We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up and switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come on, come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded, it's so romantic (It's so romantic)

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
Oh, 'cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
Every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle (Castle)
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

""Slut!" (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

Flamingo pink, Sunrise Boulevard
Clink, clink, being this young is art
Aquamarine, moonlit swimmin' pool
What if all I need is you?

Got love-struck, went straight to my head
Got lovesick all over my bed
Love to think you'll never forget
Handprints in wet cement
Adorned with smoke on my clothes
Lovelorn and nobody knows
Love thorns all over this rose
I'll pay the price, you won't

But if I'm all dressed up
They might as well be lookin' at us
And if they call me a slut
You know it might be worth it for once
And if I'm gonna be drunk
I might as well be drunk in love

Send the code, he's waitin' there
The sticks and stones they throw froze mid-air
Everyone wants him, that was my crime
The wrong place at the right time
And I break down, then he's pullin' me in
In a world of boys, he's a gentleman

Got love-struck, went straight to my head (Straight to my head)
Got lovesick all over my bed (Over my bed)
Love to think you'll never forget
We'll pay the price, I guess

But if I'm all dressed up (If I'm all dressed up)
They might as well be lookin' at us (Lookin' at us)
And if they call me a slut (If they call me a slut)
You know it might be worth it for once (Worth it for once)
And if I'm gonna be drunk
I might as well be drunk in love

Half asleep, takin' your time
In the tangerine, neon light, this is luxury
You're not sayin' you're in love with me
But you're going to
Half awake, takin' your chances
It's a big mistake, I said, "It might blow up in your pretty face"
I'm not saying, "Do it anyway" (Do it anyway)
But you're going to

(Up)
And if they call me a (Slut)
You know it might be worth it for once
And if I'm gonna be (Drunk)
I might as well be drunk in love

"Say Don't Go (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

I've known it from the very start
We're a shot in the darkest dark
Oh no, oh no
I'm unarmed
The waiting is a sadness
Fading into madness
Oh no, oh no
It won't stop

I'm standing on a tightrope, alone
I hold my breath a little bit longer
Halfway out the door, but it won't close
I'm holding out hope for you to say, "Don't go"
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go"

Why'd you have to lead me on?
Why'd you have to twist the knife?
Walk away and leave me bleeding, bleeding
Why'd you whisper in the dark
Just to leave me in the night?
Now your silence has me screaming, screaming
Say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
Say, say, say, say

Now I'm pacing on shaky ground
Strike a match, then you blow it out
Oh no, oh no
It's not fair
'Cause you kiss me and it stops time
And I'm yours, but you're not mine
Oh no, oh no
You're not there

I'm standing on the sidewalk, alone
I wait for you to drive by
I was trying to see the cards that you won't show
I'm about to fold unless you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
Oh-ah

Why'd you have to lead me on?
Why'd you have to twist the knife?
Walk away and leave me bleeding, bleeding
Why'd you whisper in the dark
Just to leave me in the night?
Now your silence has me screaming, screaming
Say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
Say, say, say, say

Why'd you have to make me want you? (Why'd you have to make me want you?)
Why'd you have to give me nothing back? (Why'd you have to)
Why'd you have to make me love you? (Why'd you have to make me love you?)
I said, "I love you," you say nothing back (I said, "I love you")

Why'd you have to lead me on?
Why'd you have to twist the knife?
Walk away and leave me bleeding, bleeding
Why'd you whisper in the dark
Just to leave me in the night?
Now your silence has me screaming, screaming
Say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
Say, say, say, say

But you won't
But you won't
But you won't
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go"
But you won't
But you won't
But you won't

"Now That We Don't Talk (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

You went to a party, I heard from everybody
You part the crowd like the Red Sea, don't even get me started
Did you get anxious though, on the way home?
I guess I'll never, ever know
Now that we don't talk

You grew your hair long, you got new icons
And from the outside, it looks like you're trying lives on
I miss the old ways, you didn't have to change
But I guess I don't have a say
Now that we don't talk

I called my mom, she said that it was for the best
Remind myself the more I gave, you'd want me less
I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost
And what it cost
Now that we don't talk

What do you tell your friends we
Shared dinners, long weekends with?
Truth is, I can't pretend it's
Platonic, it's just ended, so

I called my mom, she said to get it off my chest (Off my chest)
Remind myself the way you faded till I left (Till I left)
I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost (What I lost)
And what it cost
Now that we don't talk

I don't have to pretend I like acid rock
Or that I'd like to be on a mega-yacht
With important men who think important thoughts
Guess maybe I am better off
Now that we don't talk

And the only way back to my dignity
Was to turn into a shrouded mystery
Just like I had been when you were chasing me
Guess this is how it has to be
Now that we don't talk

"Suburban Legends (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

You had people who called you on unmarked numbers
In my peripheral vision
I let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer
All was quickly forgiven
You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious
Flush with the currency of cool
I was always turning out my empty pockets
And when it came to you

I didn't come here to make friends
We were born to be suburban legends
When you hold me, it holds me together
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

I had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs
Would surprise the whole school
When I ended up back at our class reunion
Walking in with you
You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries
With the pages ripped out
I am standing in a 1950s gymnasium
And I can still see you now

I didn't come here to make friends
We were born to be suburban legends
When you hold me, it holds me together
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

I know that you still remember
We were born to be national treasures
When you told me we'd get back together
And you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block
I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it
Waves crash on the shore, I dash to the door
You don't knock anymore, and my whole life's ruined

Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block
I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it
Waves crash to the shore, I dash to the door
You don't knock anymore, and I always knew it
And my life had been ruined

"Is It Over Now? (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)"

Once the flight had flown
With the wilt of the rose
I slept all alone
You still wouldn't go

Let's fast forward to 300 takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for something greater

Baby, was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear in your dream as you passed out
Baby, was it over then?
And is it over now?

When you lost control
Red blood, white snow
Blue dress on a boat
Your new girl is my clone

And did you think I didn't see you? There were flashing lights
At least I had the decency to keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs, and my whispered sighs
Oh Lord, I think about jumping
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come running
And say the one thing I've been wanting
But no!

Let's fast forward to 300 awkward blind dates later
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every model's bed for something greater

Baby, was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
"Come here," I whispered in your ear in your dream as you passed out
Baby, was it over then?
And is it over now?

Think I didn't see you? There were flashing lights
At least I had the decency to keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs, and my whispered sighs
Oh Lord, I think about jumping
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come running (Running)
And say the one thing I've been wanting
But no!

(Flashing lights, oh Lord) Let's fast forward to 300 takeout coffees later
(Flashing lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no (Oh Lord, oh Lord)

"Bad Blood (Remix) (Taylor's Version)"
(feat. Kendrick Lama)

'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

I can't take it back, look where I'm at
We was O-G like D.O.C., remember that? (Remember that?)
My T-L-C was quite O-D, I-D my facts
Now P-O-V of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No, I don't fear no more, better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh, wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds
Battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
You forgive, you forget, but you never let it go
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold

'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (Don't think we can solve 'em)
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

'Cause, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

"Sweeter Than Fiction (Taylor's Version)"

Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you hear is "No"
You never saw it comin'
Slipped when you started runnin'
And now you've come undone and I, I, I, I

Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh eh
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along"
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it comin'
You hit the ground runnin'
And now you're onto something, I, I, I say

What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along"
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

There you'll stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction (than fiction)

I'll be one of the many saying
"Look at you now, look at you now, now"
I'll be one of the many saying
"You made us proud, you made us proud, proud"
I'll be one of the many saying
"Look at you now, look at you now, now"
I'll be one of the many saying
"You made us proud, you made us proud, proud"

And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when, when you

Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was "No"
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever (forever)

There you'll stand, ten feet tall (ten feet tall)
I will say, "I knew it all along" (I knew it all along)
Your eyes are wider than distance (your eyes)
This life is sweeter than fiction

There you'll stand next to me (next to me)
All at once, the rest is history (ooh)
Your eyes are wider than distance (your eyes)
This life is sweeter than fiction (than fiction)

It's sweeter than fiction
It's sweeter, yeah
It's sweeter than, sweeter
Sweeter than fiction

"...Ready For It? (BloodpopÂ® Remix)"

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams (Yeah)
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (The night, my dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I'll take my time
Are you ready for it?

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams (Night, in my dreams)
You should see the things we do, baby (We'd do, baby)
Yeah, in the middle of the night in my dreams (My dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

Night, in my dreams
We'd do, baby
Yeah, in the middle of the night
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby

"All Because Of Ellen"
(with Zac Efron)

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
You better run
Outrun my gun

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
You better run
Faster than my bullet

Ellen works a long day
Giving weird interviews in a slick, cool sweater
And it gets kinda weird
Yeah, calling us like we're boyfriend and girlfriend

But it's not 'cause we're just sitting here
And we got cat videos and dance on Betty White and stuff
And it's always gonna get weird
'Cause this song is all about Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
All because of Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
Always end up dancing

I've been on this show
Eight times now and I still remember
Ellen hiding in the bathroom with a hidden camera
And she scared me so bad and I fell and I could've died

She's always asks me who I'm dating
Every time I'm on this show
And I don't even know why
But it gets five million hits on YouTube

'Cause every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
All because of Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
Really weird
Always end up dancing

"All Night Diner"

I wake up
I stretch out
I wonder what you're doin' right now
Yeah I slept in my make-up again
Tell myself I must be crazy
Thinkin' 'bout him
I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel out of my hair
About that time, you call me
And I'm reminded, without you

I'd be a stranger in an all-night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

I go to work
Work all day
I'm a walking tape recorder
Of everything you say
Walk to the car, dig out my keys
Start thinkin' if you were with anyone but me

I'm a stranger in an all-night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

There you are
On the street
Just standing there, waiting on me
I show you, my new shoes
You say you love them
And baby without you

I'm a stranger in an all-night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

I wake up
I stretch out
I wonder what you're doin' right now

"All Of The Girls You Loved Before"

When you think of all the late nights
Lame fights over the phone
Wake up in the mornin' with someone
But feelin' alone

A heart is drawn around your name
In someone's handwriting, not mine
We're sneakin' out into town
Holdin' hands, just killin' time

Your past and mine are parallel lines
Stars all aligned and they intertwined
And taught you
The way you call me "baby"
Treat me like a lady
All that I can say is

All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

When I think of all the makeup
Fake love out on the town (Ooh)
Cryin' in the bathroom for some dude
Whose name I cannot remember now

Secret jokes all alone
No one's home, sixteen and wild (Ooh)
We're breakin' up, makin' up
Leave without sayin' goodbye (Ooh)

And just know that
It's everything that made me
Now I call you "baby"
That's why you're so amazing

All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

Your mother brought you up loyal and kind
Teenage love taught you there's good in goodbye
Every woman that you knew brought you here
I wanna teach you how forever feels like

The girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street (Dead-end street) led you straight to me (Straight to me)
Now you're all I need (All I need), I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

(I love you more)
(I love you more)

"All Too Well (Sad Girl Autumn Version)"
(Recorded at Long Pond Studios)

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now
He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, oh-oh-oh-oh

And maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
Maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Just between us, I remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it

"Am I Ready For Love"

Sometimes I wonder how it's gonna feel
Will my first love be true and real?
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall?
What will I do when my love comes to call?
And my daddy tells me that I light up his world
Every day he says, "Darling, you're my best girl."
He tried to teach me from the very start
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain?
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love?

I know I'm not a little girl anymore
'Cause I'm feeling things I've never felt before
Sweet sensations and anticipations
Calling commotion to my emotions
And I hear the words my daddy said to me
He said, "Be true to yourself and keep your spirit free
And love will find you one way or another
Be good to yourself and be good to each other."

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain?
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love?

It's a run around the world
And it's moving so fast
Though I wanna find
A love that's gonna last
A love so strong
That it can withstand
The weight of this world
In the palm of its hand

Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain?
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game?
Am I ready for the kiss, am I ready for the stars?
Am I ready for the bliss, am I ready for love?

"American Boy"

American boy, living life as it goes
Sittin' on the fence posts
Living in the lie
American boy, living in the real world
Trying just to get the girl
Trying to survive

The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill avenue
And mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in this world can ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy

Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships
Looking for the love
Suddenly rise, an American beauty
Suddenly he cheats, sent from above

The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill avenue
And mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The dream of an American boy

American boy, raising little babies
Hearing, "Daddy maybe, I'll be like you"
Suddenly life seems just like a new dawn
That's grown up, American boy

The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Grandview avenue
And mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy

"American Girl"

Well, she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life
Somewhere else

After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die trying
She had one little promise she was gonna keep

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Well, it was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
She could see the cars roll by
Out on 441
Like waves crashing on the beach

And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful
It's something that's so close but still so far out of reach

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Oh, take it easy now

Oh yeah, all right
She was an American girl

"Angelina"

Angelina's got a pretty face
And really long brown hair
Lives somewhere in some wide open space
I've never been there
I guess some people come around and purpose she
But I don't 'cause

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I'm fine just a bit of a mess
And I'm not perfect you could say
I wasn't brought up that way

Just watched Stephen run across the field
Watched him catch the ball
He's got everything you'd wanna be
He's funny, dark and tall
Watch him run across to Angelina
But I won't 'cause

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I'm fine just a bit of a mess
And I'm not perfect you could say
I wasn't brought up that way

Stardom pushed across the line
Tripped over my two feet hey oh yeah
But ain't it funny how
It all comes out
Isn't life sweet?

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I'm fine just a bit of a mess
And I'm not perfect you could say

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I'm fine just a bit of a mess
And I'm not, I'm not oh
And I'm not perfect you could say
I wasn't brought up that way

"Anti-Hero (Remix)"
(feat. Bleachers)

I'm the problem, it's me

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is an art bro lately
And I just judge them on the hill
Too hurt to hang out, talking shit about your famous baby
Pierced through the heart of 90's guilt
Maybe, I'm the problem, it's me

Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(Taylor, you'll be fine)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

It's me (Me), hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
"She's laughing up at us from Hell"

I'm the problem, it's me
(Taylor)
I'm the problem, it's me

It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero

"Back To December / Apologize / You're Not Sorry"

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up, and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed, and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

And then he said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
He said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

This is me swallowing my pride
(It's too late to apologize)
Standing in front of you
(It's too late)
saying I'm sorry for that night
(It's too late to apologize)
And I go back to December 
(It's too late)
(It's too late to apologize)
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
(It's too late to apologize)
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
(It's too late to apologize)
(It's too late)

He said you're not sorry
(It's too late to apologize)
No, no, no
(It's too late)
You're not sorry
(It's too late to apologize)
No, no, no
You're not sorry
(It's too late)
No, no, no
(It's too late)
You're not sorry
No, no, no

"Bad Blood (Remix)"
(feat. Kendrick Lamar)

[Taylor Swift & Kendrick Lamar:]
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love (Uh)
So take a look what you've done (Uh)
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood (Uh), hey! (Hey!)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
I can't take it back, look where I'm at (Uh)
We was OG like D.O.C., remember that? (Remember that?)
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts (ID my)
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No, I don't fear no more
Better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more, ah!

[Taylor Swift:]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Taylor Swift & Kendrick Lamar:]
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (Uh)
You made a really deep cut (Uh)
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey! (Hey!)

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Remember when you tried to write me off? (Uh-huh)
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh, wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds
Battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

[Taylor Swift:]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Taylor Swift & Kendrick Lamar:]
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
You forgive, you forget, but you never let it go
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (Uh, uh)
If you love like that, blood runs cold

[Taylor Swift:]
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey! (Bad blood)

"Beautiful Eyes"

Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into my eyes
And sometimes I think of you late at night
I don't know why, I

I wanna be somewhere where you are
I wanna be where

You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

I wake up, I'm alive
In only a little while I'll cry
'Cause you're my lullaby
So baby, come hold me tight 'cause I-I

I wanna be everything you need
I wanna be where

You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

Just as long as you're mine
I'll be your everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh, baby, let me miss you
Let me see your
Dream about, dream about
Dream about your eyes
Eyes, eyes
Beautiful eyes

"Beautiful Ghosts"
(from "Cats" soundtrack)

Follow me home if you dare to
I wouldn't know where to lead you
Should I take chances when no one took chances on me?
So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start
With no beauty in my memory

All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into

And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

Perilous night, their voices calling
A flicker of light before the dawning
Out here, the wild ones
Are taming the fear within me
Scared to call them my friends and be broken again
Is this hope just a mystical dream?

All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into

And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

And so maybe my home isn't what I had known
What I thought it would be
But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night
And I know that this life isn't safe but it's wild and it's free

All that I wanted was to be wanted
I'll never wander London streets alone and haunted
Born into nothing
With them I have something, something to cling to
I never knew I'd love this world they've let me into

And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts

"Being With My Baby"

All is quiet in the world tonight
Counting stars and fireflies
And summer sings a lullaby
For me and my baby
On the hood of his daddy's car
We pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
It's just me and my baby
The world is spinning round
'Cause look just what I've found

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
'Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

Driving home by the river side
Wishing I could slow down time
And take a picture with my mind
Of me and my baby
The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
That back road was a better way
For me and my baby
The closer that we get
Oh, I can't leave yet

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
'Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

We both know what we've found
So he turns that car around

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Ooh, hanging with my baby
Hanging with my baby, my baby

"Bette Davis Eyes"

There is some unbelievable music that has come out of artists who are from LA, did you know that?
Like Los Angeles has put out so many bands and artists that I'm such a fan of and
I'd love to play you some music that I'm a fan of that's come from LA, is that okay?
This one came out in 1981: 8 years before I was born and I love this song. It's called "Bette Davis Eyes"

Her hair is Harlow gold
Her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll turn her music on
You won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow
She's got Bette Davis eyes

And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo stand off sighs
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll let you take her home
It whets her appetite
She'll lay you on her throne
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll expose you
And just knows you
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush (ayy, ayy)
All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes

"Better Off"

I live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
That we won't forget this Sunday
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this - our first kiss

All my friends are saying 
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off, 
you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't wanna come down
But they make it so tough
'Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want 'cause you're gone

All my friends are saying
Girl, why are you crying?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

You come to my door
In the pouring rain
We know what we don't have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
We don't have to do things their way

All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
Well, they can talk forever, they just don't know better

"Brand New World"

Watch me go into the world today
Watch me try to blow the past away
Watch me laugh and watch me cry
Watch me fall and watch me fly
'Cause I'm living in a brand new world
And you think I'm just another girl
But I'm living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday I'm gonna fly

Watch me catch a star and pin it down
Watch me live another time around
Watch me doubt the things I love
Watch me find what I'm proud of
'Cause I'm living in a brand new world
And you think I'm just another girl
But I'm living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday I'm gonna fly

And I may break my wings
And fall flat on my shattered heart
And I may hit the ground
But I will never fall apart
'Cause I'm living in a brand new world
And you think I'm just another girl
But I'm living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
I'm living in a brand new world
And you think I'm just another girl
But I'm living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday I'm gonna fly

"Breathless"

Here you are now
Fresh from your war
Back from the edge of time
And all that you were
Stripped to the bone
I thought you'd want to know

That when you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
Breathless

Lay down your guns
Too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart
Broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you won't go again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

I'm so glad to see you smiling
So good to hear your laugh
I think that you've found you even
Missed yourself
I'm only asking this because I think that
Truth be told
Oh, you'll never go again
Again, again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
Breathless

When you feel the world is crashing
Come running into my arms

"Brought Up That Way"

Emily comes home from school
Grabs onto her daddy's hand
He says, "Baby girl, what's wrong with you?"
She says, "Please, don't make me go back there again."

She said, "I wish there was some way to make them stop it."
So he drives down to that principal's office
And says

"I didn't bring her up so they could cut her down
I didn't bring her here so they could shut her out
I live my whole damn life to see that little girl's smile
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
She wasn't brought up that way."

Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh, but something's different this time
She doesn't have too much to say

She said, "He tried but there's just some things I won't do."
And through the tears she said, "I couldn't do that to you."
And he said

"I didn't bring you up so he could wear you down
Take that innocent heart and turn it inside out
I live my whole damn life to see my little girl's smile
So don't let nobody take that away
You weren't brought up that way."

The phone rings on a rainy night, says, "It's officer Tate"
He said, "Sir, there's been an accident
You better come down here right away
A drunken driver missed an overpass
And Emily, she's fading fast."

He says, "God, I didn't bring her up to watch them lay her down
Nearly killed me the day they put her own momma in the ground
Only thing kept me alive was that little girl's smile
So please, don't take that away
It won't be easy taking her today
She wasn't brought up that way."

He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyes

"By The Way"

I had to catch my breath
When I saw you there across the room
Holding her hand
I'd have never guessed
That starting over would look so good on you
But here I am
Still believing there might come a day
We'll pick up where we left off

And by the way
Your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way
My heart's still breaking
It's gonna take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say
By the way

I should've let you know
All the ways you made me feel alive
I guess it's too late
So I'll just get my coat
And make my way into this breezy night
Give you one last wave
Maybe you'll drop what you're doing
And come over here to say
I'm looking good

But by the way
Your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way
My heart's still breaking
It's gonna take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say

By the way
You still look amazing
And I must've been crazy to let you get away
By the way
If you ever wondered
Still got the same old number; just in case
I still miss you
And I still love you
By the way
By the way, oh

"Can I Go With You"

Any day now, they're talking war
I can see the look that's in your eyes
They're not talking a week or two
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?

You pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall
I always knew this time would come
When I ask how long you think you're gonna be
You say, this crazy world's come undone

Summer's over and leaves begin to fall
And another winter's on the way
I knew I wasn't gonna take this very well
But I'd give anything to have you here today

Everyday now they're talking war
And I know this time is like it's never been before
We're not talking about a week or two

Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?

"Carolina"
(from "Where The Crawdads Sing" soundtrack)

O Carolina creeks
Running through my veins
Lost I was born
Lonesome I came
Lonesome I'll always stay

Carolina knows
Why for years I roam
Free as these birds
Light as whispers
Carolina knows

And you didn't see me here
No, they never did see me here

And she's in my dreams
Into the mist, into the clouds
Don't leave
I make a fist, I make it count
And there are places I will never ever go
And things that only Carolina will ever know

Carolina stains
On the dress she left
Indelible scars
Pivotal marks
Blue as the life she fled

Carolina pines
Won't you cover me?
Hide me like robes
Down the back road
Muddy these webs we weave

And you didn't see me here
No, they never did see me

And she's in my dreams
Into the mist, into the clouds
Don't leave
I make a fist, I make it count
And there are places I will never ever go
And things that only Carolina will ever know

And you didn't see me here
They never did see me here
No, you didn't see me here
They never saw me

O Carolina knows
Why for years they've said
That I was guilty as sin
And sleep in a liar's bed
But the sleep comes fast
And I'll meet no ghosts
It's between me
The sand and the sea
Carolina knows

"Check Out This View"

I don't need a lot, but there's one thing love has taught me
It's to never expect too much
Don't need a believable touch
I just need you
I just need you

Don't need mine, I found mine
Why should we be wasting time?

You don't know what you missed
I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything I see looking at you
Check out this view

Think of a quiet beach
Think of how the waves crash down
Think about a summer's eve
No offense to them but they ain't got nothing
You walk in a room
In the light or in the dark
Well, nothing shadows who you are

And you don't know what you missed
I look into your eyes like this
You should be in front of me
Seeing everything I see looking at you
Check out this view

I look outside the window
Everyday, see something new
But all I ever wanted was a window looking at you
At you

You don't know what you missed
I look into your eyes like this
You should be in front of me
Seeing everything I see looking at you

You don't know what you missed
I look into your eyes like this
You should be in front of me
Seeing everything I see looking at you
Check out this view

"Christmas Tree Farm"

My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress, and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes, and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Under the mistletoe
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, "I love you"
Just being in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We'd run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreaming of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Under the mistletoe
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, "I love you"
Just being in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
(Baby, yeah!)

And when I'm feeling alone
You remind me of home
Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I'll pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
To you

Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, "I love you"

Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas
(Darling)
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you

Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas
(I just want you to know)
Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas
May your every wish come true

"Closest To A Cowboy"

I drive around this town
In a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well that's good enough for me
Don't need the real thing
That's just another thing
For me to try to tame
Don't know if I could
It might just break me
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I'd be a riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That's the closest to a cowboy
You'll see me

Before I met him
I was so sane and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads
And I got my heart broken
'Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I'd be a riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That's the closest to a cowboy
You'll see me

It was all a little
Wonderful and strange
But I'll never look
At a sunset the same night

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Sitting fishing by the river bank
Swimming in the water tank
That's the closest you'll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That's the closest to a cowboy
You'll see me

"Crazier"
(from "Hannah Montana: The Movie" soundtrack)

I'd never gone with the wind
Just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you open the door
There's so much more
I'd never seen it before

I was trying to fly but I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I've watched from a distance
As you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know
How that would feel
And you made it so real

You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes and you made me believe

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

Baby, you showed me what living is for
I don't wanna hide anymore

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Crazier, crazier.

"Cross My Heart"

I've been counting days and
I've been being patient
About a little thing called love
Crossing all my fingers
Letting my heart linger
Trying to get some help from up above
I don't want to jinx my luck
I've left it all behind me
And I've been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I'll pray for you and me and hope I'm right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

Dreaming of you baby
I've been thinking maybe
There is something I can do
'Cause I've been on the verge of
Running around in circles
Baby all I want is you

I don't want to jinx my luck
I've left it all behind me
And I've been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I'll pray for you and me and hope I'm right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

Do you believe in miracles
Please tell me if you've seen one
I'd like to know just where to go
Because I think I need one

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I'll pray for you and me and hope I'm right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I'll pray for you and me and hope I'm right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

"Cruel Summer (Live from TS | The Eras Tour)"

Oh, hi

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

Alright Los Angeles, we have arrived
At the very first bridge of the evening
Now, I have a question
Does anyone here know the lyrics to this bridge?
Prove it

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
Cruel summer with you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
It's a cruel summer with you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
It's a cruel summer

"Cruel Summer (LP Giobbi Remix)"

You know that I caught it (I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price

"Dark Blue Tennessee"

He said, "I got me a nice new apartment
In a city, wouldn't you have hated that?
I'm getting by with a broken heart you left me with."
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

He was lying when he said he moved to LA
He's just hiding out on the other side of town
With his head in his hands and she's just 7 miles away
He's staring out the window and puts her picture down saying

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

She almost called him on the night that he wrote
These simple words on his goodbye note

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Won't you come back to me?
I'll be here, today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

In dark blue Tennessee

"Didn't They"

She walks to school with her arms crossed
It's just another day
At 10 o'clock she hears this screaming
Then finally she sees them
It's scary how things change

And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried

Didn't she call you?
Didn't she need you bad enough?
Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't she pray too

He kissed his wife goodbye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle three men walked and said
"We're here to die for our God."
He stood up and said, "That's funny
'Cause my God died for me."

I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried

Didn't he call you?
Didn't he need you bad enough?
Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
Did you not write it down?
Just one more thing to do
Where were you?
And didn't he pray too?

The taxis pulled up on the very day of
They rode 100 floors up just to come back down
They never thought they'd see the day
That the tower's up in flames
There was nothing left to say when it all came down

And didn't they call you?
Didn't they need you bad enough?
Was there some reason I'm not aware of?
Did you not write it down?
Just one more thing to do
Where were you? Where were you?
And didn't they pray too?

I walk to school and I wear a cross
I'm counting every day

"Don't Hate Me For Loving You"

My momma stood across the room
Face to face but never eye to eye
Recalling words we said
The battle that we swore
We'd never fight
Breaking pieces off with every lie
A tear came to her eye
And she said

Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you block me out tonight
Honey where are you?
And don't hate me for loving you

He walked around my life
And made blind
With every single move
He caught me staring at him
Mad about him
Little that I knew 
Love is different
When you play the fool
And all I wanna do is say

Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you make cry tonight
Like you always do
And don't hate me for loving you

I slammed the door
Sat on the floor
Cried into my bed
Said are you there?
Do you even care?
To cross above my head
But someone said

Don't turn away now
And don't rip my heart out
Things are meant to happen like this
I know it's right for you
And don't hate me for loving you

I looked up at the sky
Face to face and finally
Eye to eye

"Down Came The Rain"

Here in my mind the sky looks the same
On every day you loved me
When we started home it started to rain
You put your coat around me
We stood there in the road
You held me so close
But did you ever let go

Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we could've been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

In through the window I see her with you
I'm soaked to the skin, you're warm and dry
I guess the storm is over for you
But look at the tears here in my eyes
I just stood there like a ghost
As you held her so close
And as I let you go

Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Love like this changes who you are
Every kiss you gave me is a scar
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

All I need is to move on fast
But all I want is to have you back
And it just keeps falling

Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we could've been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

Down came the rain

"Drama Queen"
(unreleased)

Let's break it down, I'll take the story from the slammin' of the door
Thought it was perfect for a second, guess you weren't quite as sure
Maybe I'm a little hard to get, maybe you didn't have the patience
Let's assess the situation
That girl was biding her time, yeah, she was waiting on your cue
So, somehow, I'm not surprised to see her standin' there with you
Maybe she's a little overdressed and I can see the smile you're fakin'
And the deep breath you're takin'

When you see me now, you're not lookin' at her
Yeah, it's a long way down from the bridges you burned
Might wanna sit down, I'm calling you out
Right now

You're a heartbreaker and she's a little drama queen
I'm a little over it and she's still not me
So long and back to reality
But this song's for you and your drama queen

As I was saying, I was never quite a fan of little games
It doesn't take too long to see that boys like you are all the same
Maybe I'm a little less obsessed, but she's impressed
And I should mention, she's starving for attention

I can see it now, how it's all gonna be
When she freaks out, you'll be thinkin' of me
'Cause what went down is coming back around
You'll see

'Cause you're a heartbreaker and she's a little drama queen
I'm a little over it and she's still not me
So long and back to reality
But this song's for you and your drama queen

Sometimes you get just what you see
Like, you chose her when you could've had me
Everything's a mess now, watch her little meltdown
Wish you both success and I hope you're happy

'Cause you're a heartbreaker, she's a little drama queen
I'm a little over it and she's still not me
So long and back to reality
But this song's for you and your drama
Heartbreaker and she's a little drama queen
I'm a little over it and she's still not me
So long and back to reality
But this song's for you and your drama queen

Huh-oh, for you and your drama queen
Oh-oh-oh-oh, you and your drama queen
Huh-oh, baby, you're a drama queen

"Eyes Open"
(from "The Hunger Games" soundtrack)

Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open

The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score

Keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around), oh they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown) and nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just gotta keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes

Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open

Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping

Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

"Eyes Open (Taylor's Version)"

Everybody's waiting

"Fall Back On You"

Isn't it funny how many times we can say
We've drawn the line, crossed it out, turned the page
And moved on
That's what we thought
But here I am in the same old car
Having myself another same old brown-eyed thought
Uh oh, uh oh

I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road 'til the one we're on ends
And we'll tell each other things like I need you

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I finally see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
I'll fall back on you

We always let someone come in between
Talk around the truth and never say what we mean
Look at all this wasted time

You won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end
And we'll tell each other things like I love you

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I finally see
There are people that you come back to
So fall back on me
I'll fall back on you

Maybe we'll last
Maybe we won't
Maybe we'll stop talking and I'll haunt you like a ghost
But just maybe, you belong with me

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I finally see
There are people that you come back to
So fall back on me
Baby, I'll fall back on you
Fall back on me
Baby, baby, I'll fall back on you
Fall back on you, ooh, ooh
Fall back on you

"Firefly"

Someone struck a match against the night
All I could see was you and I
I was captivated
A perfect little dream inside my head
And then reality crept in, and erased it

For a while I thought that I could hold you
But you were just a temporary high

Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you, firefly
Firefly

Something so beautiful and free
Was as never meant to be caged in
I thought I had you in my hand
I tried to catch you, but I can't
Chase the wind

And just as I reach out to touch you
I remind myself you were meant to fly

Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

I like to think I'd be all that you wanted
Not even that is enough

Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it do you?
I wish I could keep you
I wish I could keep you, firefly
Firefly

"For You"

It would've been nice to see you coming
But that would've ruined the surprise
It would've been nice to have a picture perfect world
But then the truth would hurt my eyes
It would've been good for you to be there
And every time you always would
Everything seems to have a picture perfect time
And nothing seems to be a blur

It's hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
It's nice to know you're here and you're helping me down
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one for you

Would've been cool to never fall down
But then I never would've seen
The power isn't with the picture perfect person
You told me better things to come from in between

It's hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
It's nice to know you're here and you're helping me down
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one, saying one, saying one for you

It would've been nice to see you coming
But that would've ruined the surprise
It would've been nice to have a picture perfect world
But then the truth would hurt my eyes

But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one for you...

"Gracie"

My name's Gracie
I'll be five in May
Kind of scared 'cause
I've never been on a plane
My mama says that it'll be alright
'Cause I'm going to see my daddy tonight
And she says that

There's a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

My name's Heather
Guess we're on the same flight
Don't mind Gracie
She could talk to you all night
She's finally well enough to travel
Doctor says she's in the clear
She's been in and out of hospital
Since the beginning of the year

There's a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

James T. Johnson
That's her daddy's name
He's been overseas
It'll be a year today
He never talked about being scared over the phone
He just said me and Gracie will come and take him on

There's a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

And the people that we meet
As we go through the rain
There are no accidents in what we do

"Her"

She's real pretty if you're into that brunette
Looks good without any makeup on
Green eyes kind of thing
Uh huh
She's spontaneous, she ain't afraid of anything
She's not the jealous type
She's the type you give a diamond ring

And I came along, just after she walked out
Picking up the pieces 'til I've figured out

There's a girl that you want
She's everything that I am not
And you can't stop thinking about her
There's a thin little line
And it's like you cross it every time
When you can't stop thinking about her

She came from a really small town
She liked to watch football with you
Well, I'd learn football too, if you wanted me to
Uh huh
She's really good with babies, she'd be a great mother
She said I should really meet her sometime
Uh huh

It's getting old, I wonder if you've seen
The favorite conversation's killing me

There's a girl that you want
She's everything that I am not
And you can't stop thinking about her
There's a thin little line
And it's like you cross it every time
When you can't stop thinking about her

Don't you know I was a 4.0 in school?

"Honey Baby"

I think of you every single evening
As I lay awake at night
I try to think; try to walk away with you...me in
And I say

Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us
Say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
'Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!
Oh!

Flying high, I can see his smiling
As we walk down by the drives
Take my hand, take my breath away
'Cause you make me feel like flying!

Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us
Say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
'Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!

Oh, you are everything I'll ever need
Oh, you are everything I wanna be!
Drive me crazy, have me baby
All I really wanna say is

Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us
Say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
'Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby!

"Hopelessly Devoted To You"

Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know
There's just no getting over you

You know I'm just a fool who's willing
To sit around and wait for you
But, baby, can't you see
There's nothing else for me to do?
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

My head is saying, "Fool, forget him."
My heart is saying, "Don't let go.
Hold on 'til the end."
And that's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you

But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

"I Heart ?"

Wish I had concentrated
They said love was complicated
But it's something I just fell into
And it was overrated
But just look what I created
I keep my life in black and blue
Before you ask me if I'm alright
Think about what I had to do, ooh yeah

Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart, put on my make-up
Another mess I didn't plan
And I'll bet you thought you beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand

I'll be fine if you just walk by
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right
But I can't believe you made me
Sit at home, cry like a baby
Wait right by the phone every night

And now you ask about you and I
There's no you and I
Remember what you put me through

I had to wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart, put on my make-up
Another mess I didn't plan
And I'll bet you thought you beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand

And when you're home all alone at night
You'll still wonder why
You took everything I had, oh baby
I haven't thought about you and I
There's no you and I
And I know someday you will

Wake up and smell the breakup
Realize that we won't make-up
It didn't go the way you planned
And you'll know you didn't beat me
When you look down and see
I got an I heart question mark written on the back of my hand

Written on the back of my hand
An I heart question mark, yeah
Written on the back of my hand

"I Knew You Were Trouble (Music-Video Version)"

I think - I think when it's all over,
It just comes back in flashes, you know?
It's like a kaleidoscope of memories.
It just all comes back. But he never does.
I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen.
It's not really anything he said or anything he did,
It was the feeling that came along with it.
And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again.
But I don't know if I should.
I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright.
But I just thought, how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?
Maybe he knew that when he saw me.
I guess I just lost my balance.
I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him.
It was losing me.

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies. He'll never see you cry,
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

I don't know if you know who you are until you lose who you are.

"I Knew You Were Trouble (Remix)"
(feat. Sammy Adams)

[Taylor Swift:]
Once upon time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me-e-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me-e-e-e-e

And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Until you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

[Sammy Adams:]
Double platinum wherever she go
Shout to French Torino
Met her out in Vegas, I'm not in no casino
Red lips so hard to miss
What's wrong with being promiscuous?
And I can teach you bad bad things if you into it
Don't need to get intimate just yet
Slow down I know that you're thinking you and me just met
But, girl, I got the remedy, most important the chemistry
Good girl gone bad, too much for a Kennedy
So, some say some say they sold their souls for a couple hits
I'd rather live the life of gold with the perfect chick
'Cause that one moment so breathless and you're hoping
That you'll feel the same way same way
Sparks glowing off that cute face and that sharp smile, oh, man
I haven't crushed this hard in quite awhile, oh, dang
And I could care less that you're famous
We gon' make the perfect couple
'Cause my first name Big, last name Trouble

[Taylor Swift:]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Until you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything, yeah

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Until you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

"I Know What I Want"

I like my music loud
I like my windows down
So I can scream
I like my trucks a little
Bigger than the rest
So I can see
Don't try me
Don't fight me
You be you and I'll be me

They say I've always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you

Your mom and daddy's walls
Are covered up in pictures of you
You never met a mirror
That you didn't look again into
So sorry, don't worry
I'm sure there are so many girls
Who love you like you do

They say I've always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you

Oh baby, don't persuade me
I know that you ain't used to no
So let me say it real slow

They say I've always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you

They say I've always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you

"I Want You Back"

Ooh baby give me one more chance
(I'll show you that I love you)
Oh won't you please let me
Back in your heart?

Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms

I want you back
I want you back
I want you back

I want you back(I want you back), ooh-ooh baby

I want you back
I want you back
I want you back

Oh-whoa-oh

Ooh baby give me one more chance
(I'll show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me
Back in your heart?
Oh darling I was blind to let you go
(Let you go baby)
Now that I see you in her arms
I want you back
I want you back
Ooh-ooh baby

"I Wished On A Plane"

Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kind of hard to aim

Like the tree we carved our names in
There must be an explanation
Guess it didn't get enough rain
I need reasons why you're leaving

Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written on your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

Diving off into the deep end
Honestly believed you'd be there
When I jumped in
Guess it ain't your territory
We had the perfect love story
Except the ending
Nothing comes true
When it comes to you, oh

Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

The night was so cloudy
It's not my fault
I just couldn't see

And I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
Guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kind of hard to aim

"I'd Lie"

I don't think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes

He'll never fall in love he swears
As he runs his fingers through his hair
I'm laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong

And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs

And I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him,
I'd lie

He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldn't a light go on?
Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long?

He sees everything in black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I don't let nobody see me wishing he was mine

I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him,
I'd lie

He stands there, then walks away
My God, if I could only say,
"I'm holding every breath for you."

He'd never tell you, but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up
Is "My God, he's beautiful"
So I put on my make-up
And pray for a miracle

Yes, I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, oh, and it kills me
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
If you asked me if I love him
I'd lie

"If This Was A Movie (Taylor's Version)"

Last night, I heard my own heart beatin'
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reachin'
Even though I know you're not there
I was playin' back a thousand memories, baby
Thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends are laughin'
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Back before I knew how much I had to lose

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my front door

And I say, "Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now"

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby, what about the ending?
Oh, I thought that you'd be here by now
Oh, oh
Thought you'd be here by now

"In The Pouring Rain"

I loved you for a little, a little while
I think you know that!
It would have worked for a little
Except for that day you...
It's not like you to be here
When you said you won't!

But in the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed the tune!
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules!
It's not like we could forget something quickly
Except in the pouring rain
It kills me to say this
It really does, it kills my heart!
But I might still love you
Reason we're just fallen apart
But it's not like me to answer
Gonna change my mind!

But in the pouring rain, you changed everything
You changed the tune!
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules!
And it's not like we could forget something quickly
Except in the pouring rain

Oh, am I...
All I torn myself I would be losing!
But in the pouring rain, can you feel my pain?
My tears are falling down from the sky!
In the pouring rain, I can feel...
I wonder who you love tonight
Oh, in the pouring rain
In the pouring rain
Oh, in the pouring rain!
In the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed my mind

"Just South Of Knowing Why"

She didn't have a reason to go, oh no
She didn't have a reason to stay
Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run

And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow

If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why

I didn't really know her that well
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
She felt so out of touch, because she just felt too much
If you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough

And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
That's where I'm headed right now

If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why

I don't have a plan, I don't have a map
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
I don't have a when and I don't have a where
I don't even know if I'll know when I'm there

But if I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by

I just drive on by, drive on, drive on
Drive all night
If I drive on, drive on, drive on
Drive all night, just south of knowing why

"Lavender Haze (Acoustic Version)"

Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you donât ever say too much
And you donât really read into
My melancholia
I been under scrutiny
Yeah, oh yeah
You handle it beautifully
Yeah, oh yeah
All this shit is new to me
Yeah, oh yeah

I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
Iâm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

All they keep asking me
Is if Iâm gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see
Is a one night or a wife
I find it dizzying
Yeah, oh yeah
Theyâre bringing up my history
Yeah, oh yeah
But you werenât even listening
Yeah, oh yeah

I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk

I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

"Let's Go (Battle)"

The first shot's fired, everybody's gathered around
You're looking at me like I tried to take you down
No, no, that's not what happened at all
There's no sound, I'm waiting on your next move
A showdown and I know where to hit you
But no, no, it's not how I wanted this to go down

Now we're standing in the ring
And you make the first swing
And now we're fighting dirty
Won't somebody come say "break it up"?

And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And why you're taking shots at me like
Somebody's gonna give you a medal?
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Baby let's go, oh, oh
Let's go, oh, oh

So gloves off, if this is how you want it
We had it all, but you couldn't keep a promise
No, no, I'm not the one who tore us apart
Let me remind you for a minute why we're not fine
Is she here? Is she standing on the sidelines?
Oh, oh, can't you tell this is breaking my heart?

Now we're standing in the ring
And you make the first swing
And now I'm fighting dirty
But I ain't going down 'til they break it up

And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And why you're taking shots at me like
Somebody's gonna give you a medal?
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Let's go, oh, oh
Let's go, oh, oh

Now we're standing in the ring
Breaking everything
That we've been building up so long
And I don't wanna do this break it up

But you're not who I thought you were
And this is looking more like a war
Looks like we're going to war

And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle
And I'm trying not to break down crying
No one's gonna give you a medal
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side
I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Baby let's go, oh, oh
Looks like we're going to war
Oh, oh

The first shot's fired, everybody's gathered around
You're looking at me like I tried to take you down
No, no, but if you wanna fight, baby, let's go

"Live For The Little Things"

One daybreak, one heartache
Every once-upon-a-time
That black dress, happiness
Bubble baths and quarter lines

They mean so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one

Clear midnights and this spotlight
Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
A blue bonnet, a braid on it
Quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
Live for the little things

Oil paintings and making
Every detail turn out bad
One last stands, new romance
Living for that love and person

They mean so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one

Clear midnights and this spotlight
Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
A blue bonnet, a braid on it
Quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
Live for the little things

Ohh, yeah
Ohh

No fighting, black riding
Wish upon a star and give the moon a smile
Pretending, defending
Take a risk and go along for the ride
Strawberries and fairies with wings
Live for the little things

Na na na
Oh, yeah
Na na na
Ohh, yeah
Na na na

"Long Time Coming"

I got a lying smile I never put out for you
Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
And they say little girls have big dreams
And nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it'd be a long time going

They say it's better to have lost than never to have loved at all
And I say, whoever said that didn't have too far to fall
And they say little girls are so naive
That wasn't how it was supposed to be with me and you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

I've burned my bridges, had sleepless nights
Washed my sins on the neon lights
And I'm still not over you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

A long time going

And it will be a long time, long time going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

It will be a long time, long time going, going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

"Look At You Like That"

There you are
Standing there looking like you don't know what to say
But I know that face
And here I am
Bracing myself for what I know is coming my way
What a waste

For all of that time, I thought you were mine
Was I just kidding myself?
Letting it go and loving you so
Don't you dare tell me not to look at you like that

I'm gonna look at you like that
I'm gonna hang my head and turn my back
To your sneak attack
If it's the last thing that I do
I'm gonna make this hard on you
While I look at you like that

Don't you say
That we can still be friends, it doesn't work that way
The end is the end
And don't you dare think
That I'll pack up all my tears and take them home
And cry them out when I'm alone

I'll do it right here, I'm crying right now
You come and you can watch me crumble down
That's for breaking my heart, so, baby, don't start
Thinking you can ask me not to look at you like that

I'm gonna look at you like that
I'm gonna hang my head and turn my back
To your sneak attack
If it's the last thing that I do
I'm gonna make this hard on you
While I look at you like that

Don't you tell me to be strong
Or make it harder than it has to be
After you are gone
You'll remember what you've done to me

'Cause I'm gonna look at you like that
Gonna hang my head and turn my back
To your sneak attack
If it's the last thing that I do
After what you put me through
I'm gonna have to let you know
How much it hurts to let you go

Oh yeah
Gonna look at you like that
Look at you, look at you, look at you
Like that

"Look What You Made Me Do"
(Music Video Version)

I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh!)

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams

(Ooh, look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you just made me do)
"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now."
(Look what you just made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
"Why?"
(Look what you just made me do)
"Oh, 'cause she's dead!" (Oh!)

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

"Love Story (Taylor's Version) (Elvira Remix)"

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go"
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go"
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Oh, oh

But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come"
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

"Love They Haven't Thought Of Yet"

I want it all to appear before my eyes when he smiles
Maybe I'm wrong but I don't think Romeo would be my kind of guy
I want a love that's sweeter than roses
And for me this is how it's gonna be

Like there's a fairytale sky
And it whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet

Here on the couch with a box of chocolates that I bought myself
I'll wait it out but sometimes my patience just needs a little help
It's what you get when your heartstrings are so tied
I don't regret it 'cause it needs to be perfect

Like there's a fairytale sky
And it whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet

I want my own little storybook ending
We'll make it up as we go

There's a fairytale sky
And it whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet

I want love they haven't thought of yet

"Love To Lose"

Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out
Sorry for the inconvenience, I didn't mean to let you down
We were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see that to me
You were the perfect view of misery

I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the days he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

Let's talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night
How was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside
He smiled and I smiled, well the camera's in your mind
And I lied, I swore that everything was fine

I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

I know you wanna talk about me
How I gave up on love so foolishly
But keep in mind

I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out

"Lover (First Dance Remix)"

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

"Lover (Remix)"
(feat. Shawn Mendes)

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever
And ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

We could light a bunch of candles
And dance around the kitchen, baby
Pictures of when we were young would hang on the wall
We would sit on the stoop
I'll sing love songs to you when we're eighty
See, I finally got you now, honey, I won't let you fall

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
Look in my eyes, they will tell you the truth
The girl in my story has always been you
I'd go down with the Titanic, it's true, for you, lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover (Save you a seat)

Can I go where you go? (Can I go where you go, baby?)
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

"Macavity"
(feat. Idris Elba)
(from "Cats" soundtrack)

Macavity's a mystery cat, he's called the Hiddenpaw
For he's the master criminal who can defy the law
He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair
For when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there

Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity
His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare
But when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there

Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin
You would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in
His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed
He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake
And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake

Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
For he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity's not there

He's outwardly respectable, I know, he cheats at cards
And his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland Yard's
And when the larder's looted and the jewel case is rifled
Or when the milk is missing or another peke's been stifled
Or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair
There's the wonder of the thing, Macavity's not there

Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare
What ever time the deed took place, Macavity wasn't there
And they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
I might mention Mungojerrie, Rumpleteazer, Griddlebone
Are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time
Just controls the operations, the Napoleon of Crime
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity, Macavity
Macavity, Macavity

When a crime's discovered, then
Macavity's not there

"Made Up You"

Your feet under the table
I love it when they're touching mine
Your hands make the best kind of cradle
To tell me everything is fine
All I see is you looking at me

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

You smile just like a picture
It doesn't even need a frame
Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my name
And all I want is just what I've got

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

I'd never let you go
Even If I could
Cause I never could've dreamed you up this good

Oh oh

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

Made Up You

Oh oh

Made Up You

"Making Up For Lost Love"

I need you more than I know how to mention
And I'd give forever to get your attention
Be you're summer midnight with starry blue eyes
That only see you and are yours every night
Ooh, ooh, love's like this
It's something I missed
Ooh, ooh, love's like this

And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
'Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

All of the days that I couldn't get it right
It all disappeared lying here by your side
With your dirty blue jeans and my crooked smile
You make it look easy changing my life
Ooh, ooh, love's like this
It's something I missed
Ooh, ooh, love's like this

And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
'Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

Heaven had quite the time
To figure this life out
But baby I've got mine
To give you everything you dream about
Ooh, ooh, love's like this
It's something I missed
Ooh, ooh, love's like this

And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
'Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
'Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

"Mandolin"

He's got a nice little life
He's gonna live it, but on
Friday nights he plays that mandolin
Painted red, and he said
It's not the best I know
But it's mine, I'm gonna make it mine

People there can't help but care
About the friendly music of a guy
Who's getting by from their applause
He's got a song that moves along
He's got his local crowd tonight
At Angelina's family bar and grill

He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin

Got a car, got a scar
Like everyone he's got a few but
Everybody loves that mandolin
Got his problems, bills to pay
Somehow that boy finds a way
Through paychecks in tip jars, yeah

He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin... mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin

Oh he's the kind of guy
Who never really wanted fame
His feet are planted firmly on the ground
He never wanted people to remember his name
He never wanted word to get around
That he found heaven on earth

He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin
Oh, I'm the guy who plays the mandolin
Mandolin
Oh, mandolin

"Matches"

I shined your shoes
I poured the wine
I gave you all of my time

I patched your dance smile
That your friends
Which apparently is a crime

I gave you space
You took my place
And gave it to her

But life's too long
To waste it all loving a liar

And when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it down

I keyed her car
Got my guitar
And wrote this damn song

Look what you've found
She's been around
I hear the lines long

And don't you tell me
To be nice
I'm not a nice girl

She died from complications
Of the things you told her

So when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it down

Ain't it funny
You said honey
You meant sitting duck
Well i say cheater, liar, truck on fire, loser, leaver, deceiver
Just a few I've thought of

And when love hands me matches now
'Gonna burn it down
I'm gonna burn it down
Oh yeah
Gonna burn it, burn it, burn it down

Matches, now

"Me And Britney"

Me and Britney used to sit on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever supposed to hear
In the summer shade
She said she was gonna be a movie star
And I said she was crazy
Catching dreams and fireflies in a jar
Just me and Britney

Oh, oh
We were babies, we were beautiful and free
Oh, oh
There was nothing that was out of reach
For me and Britney

She never made it to Hollywood but she made it to Memphis
And this little old town just hasnât been the same since
That boy she went ran off with, well I thought he was crazy
Maybe I was just jealous that he'd come between me and Britney

Oh, oh
She was in love, she was beautiful and free
Oh, oh
She was always so much braver than me

When the phone rang in the middle of the night
Before she said a word I knew it was her
She said Iâm sorry for waking you up but I didnât know who else to call
Or where else to go

Me and Britney sat down on the front porch
Talking about love and how it changes things
Changes people and it changes names and everything but me and Britney

Oh, oh
Weâre not as young, but weâre still beautiful and free
Oh, oh
Even when weâre old, weâre still gonna be

Me and Britney sitting on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever gonna hear in the summer shade

"Monologue Song (La La La)"

I like glitter and sparkly dresses,
But I'm not gonna talk about that
In my monologue
I like baking and things that smell like winter,
But I'm not gonna talk about that
In my monologue

La la la, la la la

I like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me,
But I'm not gonna say that
In my monologue
I like writing their names into songs so they're ashamed to go in public,
But I'm not gonna say that
In my monologue

La la, la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

You might think I'd bring up Joe,
The guy who broke up with me on the phone,
But I'm not gonna mention him
In my monologue
Hey Joe! I'm doing real well,
Tonight I'm hosting SNL
But I'm not gonna brag about that
In my monologue

La la la, ha ha ha
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha
La la la

And if you're wondering if I might,
Be dating the werewolf from Twilight,
(Hi Taylor!)
I'm not gonna comment on that
In my monologue

La la, la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

You might be expecting me to say
Something bad about Kanye
And how he ran up on the stage
And ruined my VMA monologue.....

But there's nothing more to say
Cause everything's okay
I've got security lining this stage
This is my SNL monologue

La la, la la la la la
This is my SNL monologue
La la, la la la la la
That was my SNL monologue

"My Cure"

I know we've got a lot to say
Between now and forever
But I'd be a game if you would play
And my dear you get better

All throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do
Is follow you

If you leave I'll be crawling back for more
If you need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure

Wherever you think I am tonight
Just know we're miles from a heartbreak
Because in the blink of a pretty brown eye
I'll be right where you are baby

Sometime along the way you take my breath away
Distracted by he view
I fall right into you

And if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

They say I need to see all the people out there waiting
But you take one look at me
And I know the mistake I'd be making

Because if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you be my cure

I know we've got a lot to say between now and forever

"Need"

Want is the cigarette smoke on a jacket
You wore to the wrong part of town
Desire is the sound of the whiskey
Telling me you miss me, can you come around?

Passion is a passing thing
It's accidental chemistry
Lust is a liar, a short-lived fire
It ain't what you and I are at all

Oh, it's a need, it's a need
I would go anywhere that you lead
I am hopeless, breathless, burning slow
Touch me, hold me, tell me, "I won't let you go"
I won't leave, it's a need

Danger is a thousand prickles on my neck
That tell me to run or to freeze
Fear is the nightmare I had, you were with someone else
You forgot about me

Passion is a passing thing
It's accidental chemistry
Caught up in a feeling, it can be deceiving
This is like breathing for me

Oh, it's a need, it's a need
I would go anywhere that you lead
I am hopeless, breathless, burning slow
Touch me, hold me, tell me, "I won't let you go"
I won't leave, it's a need

Baby, it's always
A new kiss every time we do this
The truth is
It's essential to me
That you love me more than
Wishing, longing

Oh, it's a need (It's a need), it's a need (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
I would go (I would go) anywhere (Anywhere) that you lead (Oh, oh)
I am hopeless, breathless, burning slow (Burning slow)
Touch me, hold me, tell me, "I won't let you go"
I won't leave (I won't leave), it's a need (Oh)

"Need You Now"

I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

I need you now
Words I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came

My world's a little colder now
But I'm keeping warm somehow

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you?
I don't need you don't need you now

"I need you now"
Words I heard you whisper to me
While we were walking down a one-way street

You need me now
That's what you've been telling my friends
But I've come too far to go back there again

My heart my mind and numbers have changed
You might as well forget my name

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you don't need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you?
I don't need you don't need you now

"I need you now"
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you don't need you
And I waited so frustrated
So who's gonna hold you?
I don't need you now
And I don't know where you are
I don't wonder where you are
I don't dream about you cause I don't need you now

I don't dream about the way
That I never heard you say
"I need you I need you"
I don't need you now

Don't need you
Don't need you now

"Nevermind"

Look at you
Look at me
Look at who we could be
I wanna know who you are
What you want from the stars
And every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you

And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind

All the time
Everyday
There's nothing I can do, baby, to make it go away
So look at you
And look at me
And think of who we could be
But every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you

And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind

All I really wanna say is I need you, babe
But how could you understand?
What happens if you turn away and everything turns blue and grey?
And I just wish I told you never mind
And I could tell you now, but baby, never mind
Yeah, oh yeah
I could tell you now but never mind
Yeah, oh yeah yeah
And I could tell you now but never mind

"New Romantics (Music-Video Version)"

"The fans are the best part of this tour
They are the reason the shows are incredible
And I know those fans out there, are just all in"

We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We're so young but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace

We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come on, come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded
It's so romantic

"I don't wanna forget anything that happened on this tour
It was one of those remarkable moments in time when everything felt exciting.
1989!"

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

"Looking out into like an endless ocean of crowd
That was everything
We're all really sad that it's ending
But we're really happy because of what it was"

"One Thing"

It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
And there's nothing to say and I try to grab at the fray
'Cause I, I still love you but I can't

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah

The picture frame is empty
It's black and white, you're smiling down at me
I take your photo off the dash
And back to the conversation
I was so sure of everything, everything I thought we'd always have
I'm lost in the sound of it
But here in the now comes in
Seems like I'm becoming part of your past

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me

And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And I can feel you like you're slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me, yeah, yeah
There was one thing I knew would never leave me

It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin

"One Way Ticket"

Standing on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
There's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
I'm heading out tonight, traveling light
I'm gonna start all over again

And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
'Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting, down at the station
All I had to do was make up my mind

And buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
'Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Well, I have walked through the fire
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out

Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
'Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know

Buy a one-way ticket on a west bound train
I'm gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
Gonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings
Gonna climb that mountain, gonna do everything

"Only The Young"
(from "Taylor Swift: Miss Americana" soundtrack)

It keeps me awake
The look on your face
The moment you heard the news
You're screaming inside
And frozen in time
You did all that you could do
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think they're right
You were outnumbered â this time

But only the young
Only the young
Only the young
Only the young can run
Can run, so run
And run, and run

So every day now
You brace for the sound
You've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly, they forget

They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun

Only one thing can save us
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young

Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young
Only the young (Only the young)
(Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time
Up there's the finish line)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young
Can run

Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (Can run)
Up there's the finish line
So run, and run, and run
Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (So run)
Up there's the finish line
And run, and run, and run

Only the young
Only the young
Only the young

"Perfect Have I Loved"

If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you 'til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved

Do you remember the stupid things we used to do?
Before September stole me away from you?
The time we got your truck stuck in the creek?
'Cause, baby, roads weren't wild enough for you and me, sayin'

If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you 'til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved

I used to see you by the bridge we used to cross
I found the feeling of trying to get lost
You would smile that smile that I tried so hard to forget
It's hard to douse a fire that I still haven't put out yet

And if you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you 'til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved

Love was all we knew, and faith was growing on the vines
Words were all we had, and for one summer, you were mine
Sayin'

If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you 'til I'm old, but if I can't, at least I'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved

"Permanent Marker"

I know he loved you
A long time ago
I ain't jealous of you
Just thought you should know

You were never good enough for him
Or anything like me
So you might as well sit back
'Cause I ain't trying to show maturity

"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

I found that picture
Of you in that green dress
You sure had a good time
Cleaning up that mess

He found 30 other pieces
But he'll never find them all
Tried to tape it back together
Now he knows to keep it off the wall

"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart

"X" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh, yeah
Just like the mark that you knew that you were making
Who do you think you are?
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

In permanent marker

Oh, permanent marker

"Revenge"

I could've keyed your car
I could've rolled your yard
I know the passwords to your e-mails, everything you do
I could've put 'em to good use

But I'm dressed to kill and tonight I'm going out on a date
With your best friend, he always liked me anyway

R-E-V-E-N-G-E

So I'm gonna paint the town with him
Replace your memory, everywhere we've ever been

And I'll make you hear me laughing, like I just don't care

I know you hate my friends so tonight I called 'em all
Later on you can expect some prank phone calls, baby

"Ronan"

I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back

I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me, waking me up

I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming "Why?"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
Out of this curtained room in this hospital grey, we'll just disappear
Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
Come on baby with me, we're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back

"Safe & Sound"
(feat. The Civil Wars)
(from "The Hunger Games" soundtrack)

I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, "I'll never let you go."
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone,"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window, darling.
Everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone
Gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
La, la (la, la)
La, la (la, la)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
La, la (la, la)

Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light,
You and I'll be safe and sound...

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh, oh

"Safe & Sound (Taylor's Version)"

I remember tears streaming down your face when I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come, morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window, darlin', everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps ragin' on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone, gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come, morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

"Spinning Around"

Days go by, I wonder if you hear me
Can't you read between the lines?
Now I'm standing still, I am disappearing
Take this chance, I'll make you mine

Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

He tells lies, are you really thinking
That you deserve another try
When you see these eyes
You see another planet
Don't ask how, but fate decides

Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning and turning
And living and learning
I should be able to handle this
Make it or break it
Move it or shake it
Do it or fake it
Girl you've got to make it

But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And all I see is you

"Stupid Boy"

Let me know, how's it feel
To be under my skin, wrapped around my heart
Is it like anywhere you've been?
And everything I do, I do it just for you
So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

I have been looking in, trying to read your mind
Give you the benefit of the doubt, every single time
And then you walk right by, I'm screaming out inside
Why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

What happens when you wake up, to see that you've lost?
You take one look at me, 'cause that's what it cost
I just wanna be everything you need
'Cause you're everything to me

So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

Let me know, how's it feel to be under my skin

"Sugar"

What a thing to see
What a thing to be
What a perfect love, what a perfect home
'Cause every time she walks
And every time she talks
Is every time he knows what a perfect world he's living on

But whenever he's gone and when she's all alone
His heart goes out to her on the telephone

And he says, "Sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time"
He calls her "Sugar" 'cause she's the sweetest thing
Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find

With her midnight hair
And with his favorite stare
She's a southern belle, he's a rockout king
When she looks around
Oh, she knows she's found
Such a perfect life, such a perfect thing

And whenever he's gone and when she's all alone
His heart goes out to her on the telephone

And he says, "Sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time"
He calls her "Sugar" 'cause she's the sweetest thing
Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find

Oh, there's a reason for every season
There's a change within the range of every heart
But the reason and the season
Seem to be right so far

And he says, "Sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time"
He calls her "Sugar" 'cause she's the sweetest thing
Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find

He calls her "Sugar"

"Sweet Tea And God's Graces"

Tire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
Wilson County creek
Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass
Baby, you were watching me
Cold barns, truck beds, everything you said
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
Just like the two of us
Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
Guess I loved you way too much
But I'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder
But it's still soft enough to cry
'Cause I remember those times

I remember

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Saw you just the other day
All that I could think to say was
"Hey, how have you been?"
You caught me with that old smile
Said, "It's really been a while
And I still think about back when..."

We used to get high on the first kiss
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and now I'm someone new
And that's what I learned from you

Oh, that's what I learned from you
That's what I learned from you, oh you, oh
That's what I learned from you, oh yeah

"Tell Me"

It was something like a perfect start to this love yesterday
But now who are you?
I thought I knew
Your eyes happen now to look right through me
It's like you forgot the words you whispered to me
They weren't true
It's like it wasn't you

Could you tell me what did I do?
Because it can't be we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool after you held me?
Was that just what you do?
What did you need from me?
Tell me

Take time to realize
I know that people change their minds
But that was something I wished you would say to my face
But you ran away

Could you tell me what did I do?
Because it can't be we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool after you held me?
Was that just what you do?
What did you need from me?
Tell me

If I had a reason or a simple goodbye
Baby, even a lie
Yeah, yeah

Tell me what did I do
'Cause, baby, suddenly we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool after you held me?
Was that just what you do?
What did you need from me?
And tell me

And tell me
Oh-oh-oh, oh-yeah
And tell me
Tell me

"Ten Dollars And A Six Pack"

You were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldn't have
You were country lovin'
Really somethin' for three months and a half
Everybody said that you were bad news
But, baby, I was betting on you

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
I guess I'm gonna have to listen to my mama's "I told you so"
But you ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

I said, "Let them say we're crazy," you said, "Let's go fishing tonight"
The midnight moon was blazing baby, I was looking into your eyes
Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
I guess I'm gonna have to listen to my mama's "I told you so"
But you ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

Can't believe the time you lost me
Can't believe what it cost me

I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
Had to go and listen to my mama's "I told you so"
You ain't never been through that
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

"Tennessee"

Standing on a street somewhere I don't wanna be
In a town that's made of stone
Some bad directions must have me here by mistake
'Cause this sure ain't what I call home

Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can get out of here, and

Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
And I'm in Tennessee

Standing on a road leading to a barn
With a cat named Eloise
Later on, we'll all go fishing in the pond
But all we'll catch is just a summer breeze

Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can stay right here, and

Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
And I'm in Tennessee

When the pond is gone and Eloise floats away
I find myself staring at the same old day
I need to go back, back to where I feel so free
Well, it looks like I'm going back to Tennessee

I let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
Just me and Eloise
And I'm in Tennessee

"That's Life"

Like one of those fireflies
Oh, it looks so good 'til it's in your hand
It's like one of those memories
Where you can't let go but you just can't stand
It's like one of those crazy dreams
And the permanent screens in the magazines
Saying, "Why'd I love?
All it does is break your heart"

One morning does it all add up?
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?
You're getting close to giving up
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie, live or die
I, well, I guess that's life

Like one of those people
With the beautiful eyes and the perfect face
It's like one of those stories
Where the hero dies in the very last race
Like one of those endless cries
And the crazy lies of a hurting child
Saying, "Why did love have to hurt?
It broke my heart"

One morning does it all add up?
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?
You're getting close to giving up
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie, live or die
I, well, I guess that's life

I always liked to think
That I was always brave enough
To try to master any push and shove
Well I guess I never qualified love

One morning does it all add up?
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?
You're getting close to giving up
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie, live or die
I, well, I guess that's life
Oh, I guess that's life
Well, I guess that's life

"That's When"

[Taylor Swift:]
You said, "I know"
When I said, "I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this"
You watched me go
And I knew my
Words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back
And I said, "When can I-I-I come back?"

[Taylor Swift and Keith Urban:]
And you said that's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when
Mm, mm

I said, "I know"
When you said, "I did you wrong
Made mistakes
And put you through all of this" (through all of this)
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said, "Leave those all in our past"
And you said, "When can I-I-I come back?"

And I said, that's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when"

[Taylor Swift:]
And you said, "Honestly
When you were gone
Did you ever think of me?"
And I said

[Taylor Swift with Keith Urban:]
"That's when, when I woke up in the morning
That's when, it was sunny or storming
Laughing when I was crying
And that's when, you were waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby, that's when"

That's when, when I wake up in the morning (Yeah)
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
When I'm laughing, when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
(That when I miss you, that's when I want you)
That's when, when I see your face
That's when I love you, that's when

"The Diary Of Me"

I'm a laid back
T-shirt, blue jean, mood ring
Kinda girl
Hey yeah what's the word on you
Lay low I'm a mission rebel
Angel devil
Little left of the middle
Sometimes I get temperamental

But here I am an open book
Turn the page it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

I'm poetry, complicated
Simply stated
Hey yeah baby how about you
I was born free
I'm a cell phone hippie
Are you with me?
When I mess up I don't get up
I just get down yeah

But here I am an open book
Turn the page it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

It's raining on Sunday
There's nothing on TV
Yesterday was lonely
You're the only one who gets me
My mind is like an island
Drifting through the ocean
I can't stop thinking about you
I bet you're thinking of me too

Well here I am an open book
Turn the page it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me
Yeah here I am an open book
Turn the page it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh what you get is what you see
Baby you hold the key
To the diary of me

"There's Your Trouble"

Should have been different but
It wasn't different, was it
Same old story, dear John
And so long
Should have fit like a glove
Should have fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring
A token of true love
Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

There's your trouble
There's your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You can't see I love you
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

So now you're thinking 'bout
All you're missing how
Deep you're sinking
Round and round and dragging down
Why don't you cash in your chips
Why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss
Chalk it up better luck
Could have been true love
But it wasn't
It should all add up
But it doesn't

There's your trouble
There's your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You can't see I love you
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

There's your trouble
There's your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You can't see I love you
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble

"Thirteen Blocks (Can't Call It Love)"

Stumble up the porch step
You sat down in the car
Only thirteen blocks across this town
To get to where you are
And that don't offer me much time
To make up my mind
So I best be driving slow
On my way to letting go

These headlights they just wanna fade
Off into the night
But if they're half as stubborn as me
They'll just keep on shining bright
I ain't ever been one to settle like
The dust does on the dash
Since the feeling ain't strong
I'll just move on
And leave this in my past

Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wonderin' 'bout how I'll feel the day
I see you find somebody new
So I've been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I'm gonna miss you bad but
Can't call it love if you ain't in it

Red light turns to green
Then back to red again
I wish there were some other travelers out here
To slow my travelling
Even though the wheel rolled on
Inside I still don't know
Oh and it troubles me so, oh

Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wonderin' 'bout how I'll feel the day
I see you found somebody new
And I've been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I might miss you bad but
Can't call it love if you ain't in it

Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how I'll feel today
I see you found somebody new
So I've been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I might miss you bad but
Can't call it love if you ain't in it

Your car comes to a rest in the drive
You open up the door and I see you smile

"This Here Guitar"

Walking downtown shuffling my feet
I try to dream my dreams above the concrete
Store windows, traveled for miles
But something I passed really caught my eye
It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars
But I fell in love with this here guitar

Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar

It was my baby, anyone could see
I love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty
But I can't help wondering why
It came to me and where we'll say goodbye
The cracks down the middle
Can't see where they are
Since I fell in love with this here guitar

Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend
This here guitar

Were you a present from a father to a son?
Did he forget you
Or just play you 'til you came undone?
Hey, did some prima donna love you
'Til she got her fame and fortune?
I won't do that to you

Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been?
What have you seen?
Who were you before you even knew me?
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend?
This here guitar
You're my guitar
This here guitar

"This Is Really Happening"

Beneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows opened up
The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound
It's like I'm melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move
And

Tell me
You'll never leave me
And I'm not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

Could this be better?
You write me letters
Though you see me every day
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights
It really blows me away

Lock me up in a dark room
And I still can't take my eyes off you

Tell me
You'll never leave me
And I'm not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

All those kisses up against your car
For all those wishes on planes
We thought were stars
Memories like photographs
Oh, baby, here we are

Tell me
You'll never leave me
And I'm not crazy and
Oh, this is really happening
Oh, oh, baby

Tell me
You'll always need me
That I drive you crazy
And this is really happening
Oh, that this is really happening

Tell me, oh
You'll always need me
(Need me, tell me)
(Baby)
That I drive you crazy
(Oh)
That this is really happening

"Thug Story"
(feat. T-Pain)

[T-Pain:]
Hey hey, T-Swizzle T-Swizzle
And T-Pizzle T-Pizzle

[Taylor Swift:]
I'm like 8 foot 4
Blond hair to the floor
You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore
No I ain't got a gun
No I never really been in a club
Still live with my parents but I'm still a thug

I'm so gangster you can find me baking cookies at night
You out clubbing but I just made caramel delight
T-Swift and T-Pain rapping on the same track
It's a thug story, tell me can you handle that?

[T-Pain and Taylor:]
I had a dream last night

[Taylor Swift:]
I had high-top Nikes
I had

[T-Pain and Taylor:]
Diamonds in my mouth
And diamonds on my mic

[Taylor Swift:]
By the time I woke I was singing

[T-Pain:]
I'm on a boat

[Taylor Swift:]
'Cause I'm a singer turned rapper

[T-Pain:]

[Taylor Swift (T-Pain):]

Hey, hold on, hold on
I didn't even say anything

I said, "Yo."
(Yup)
You guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
I didn't swear
(She didn't even swear)
Hello? Ugh!

"Til Brad Pitt Comes Along"

Do you remember the day
I leaned up against your car
And it started rolling down the street?
You screamed and ran after it
And tried to open the door
And it ran over your foot
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
And I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

Do you remember the time we watched "Carrie"
And you said it reminded you of me
And I threw the remote at you
And you said, "My point exactly."
And later on that night, under the neon city lights
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you

And I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

You call me lucky 'cause I lose everything
But I swear I'd be careful with it
If you gave me a ring

And it would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
And I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't play our song
I wish that pretty girls wouldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along
'Til Brad Pitt comes along
Yeah, oh oh
Until Brad Pitt comes along

"Today Was A Fairytale"
(from "Valentine's Day" soundtrack)

Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey T-shirt
You told me I was pretty
When I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile that takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale

"Under My Head"

Are you trying to make me fall
'Cause with a face like that baby
It won't take too long
Keep on melting me with those eyes
And I think in a while I'll be hypnotized
Sitting here singing

Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

Baby somewhere around the time
The moment I saw you
With your hair all sticking up 
I was all caught up
'Cause baby you were so damn cute
I need you to need me 
See the train is coming for me
Help me, save me from this crash at last

Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

Na na na na na na na na na 
You seem to be just what I've tried to find
And your name looks so good written next to mine
Next to mine
Next to mine

Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh I really really want you
Oh, oh I love you I love you
Oh, oh.. 

Ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

"Viva La Vida"

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"

One minute I held the keys
Next the doors were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

"Wait For Me"

If you had only gotten to me first
If I could write a book on how this hurts
If you could see the way your smile looks to me

If I wasn't scared of the world alone
If I didn't know he loves me so
If I could only find the strength to leave
You'd be with me, so baby

Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me

As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me

It's so wrong that all I wanna do
Is forget it all and just be with you
I have to go 'cause he don't know
But the writing's on the wall

But here we are in so deep
Soaking wet
Jumping in without no safety net
And I don't know what kinda ropes
Would break this kinda fall, so baby

Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go, I hope you think of me

As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait, wait for me

We can't be together right now
Guess there's no use in trying
But if you look at me right now
Can you tell that I'm dying
To hold you
But it would be wrong to

So don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me

Don't you look now
Don't you look now
I might fall in love
Don't you look now

"We Were Happy"

We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy

I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy

When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happy

When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

Oh, I hate those voices
Telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices
And that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy

We were happy

When it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
When we were happy

Yeah, we were were happy
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We were happy

"Welcome Distraction"

I got a little thing I call self control
'Cause I get a little crazy
When I let too much go
Love's a little messy and you are too
Right now I'm scared of both of you
I laugh and I play and I wasn't gonna stray
Swore I'd never let a man in my way

You're the last thing I needed today

And I don't know
Where I lost control
And couldn't take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can't win so I give in
The more I fight it just gets stronger
You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction

Gone and spilled my coffee
Tryna get to the phone
'Cause it might be you
You just never know
Can't talk to my friends
Without you coming up
It's even kind of cute
The way you cuss
I wrote your name down
A hundred thousand times
'Cause it looks so good
Right next to mine

You're the last thing I needed tonight

And I don't know
Where I lost control
And couldn't take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can't win so I give in
The more I fight it just gets stronger
You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction

I'm acting like a girl
With nothing to lose
When did I stop caring
About anything but you

And I don't know
Where I lost control
And couldn't take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can't win so I give in
The more I fight it just gets stronger
You're an inconvenient kind of satisfaction

Welcome distraction, welcome distraction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction oh oh

"What Do You Say"

What do you say, when you just know
That he's the one, and you wanna go fast
But he's taking it slow
And what do you do, when he's next to you
But he's a little bit shy
Well here's something you can try

Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?

What do you see, when you look in his eyes
There's something there
That he can't disguise
No matter how he tries
And what do you feel, when you know it's real
And you can't sit still
If you don't own up will yeah

Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?

My imagination's running away
Just dreaming about
What I want you to say

Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday

What do you say?
What do you say?

What do you say?

"What To Wear"

She's looking in the mirror
The moment's getting nearer
She thinks about it as she walks her walk
Up and down the staircase
Make up fresh on her face
She thinks about it as she talks her talk

School dance, first chance
Always been a dreamer
There's one guy, she's shy
Sees him through the mirror
And everybody looks at her
She thinks about it

Blue dress, angel face
Looking in the mirror
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air

Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wondering what to wear

She's standing in her bedroom
He'll be pulling up soon
She thinks about it when she sees headlights
Looking out the window
She's got her diary to show
That she's been waiting for this all her life

First date, can't wait
Looking in the mirror
Heart all wrapped up
Wait until he sees her
He's looking right at her
She thinks about it

Sixteen blue jeans, Abercrombie T-shirt
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air

Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wondering what to wear

The years went by
The mirror saw her cry
She got up again
She got up again
The wind blew by
The small town lights
She got up again

Move out, find out
Where the world can take her
Bright lights, late nights
Living for the greater
Move to Paris
Living on a prayer

Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wondering what to wear

Ohh, oh, oh
Wondering what to wear

"Who I've Always Been"

You walk in here with your guitar man
Your shiny boots and your full on band
A smile on your face, a knife in your hand
Singing songs you've got memorized
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your hands

But don't worry yourself I ain't your competition
But don't flatter yourself that was never my intention

I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you in an empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you wanna be and who I've always been

I walk in here with a beat up case
The same guitar I've always played
And the words I wrote down on a page
When I was 12 years old a small town raised
You tell the crowd you're paying dues
I tell them, "This is what I do."
And it's what I put my life into
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume

And say life on musical road is rough conditions
Oh but the easy ride was never my ambition

I wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you in an empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you wanna be and who I've always been

Let's talk about your childhood days
You were the prom queen, I was on this stage
So where's that crown gotten you these days?
When it's me and you and the same damn games

So what have you got that I ain't?
And what can you do that I can't?
Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about who you wanna be, girl, and who I've always been

"Writing Songs About You"

I can't believe you did it again
Walked by and took my heart with you
Why'd you have to look so good?
Don't you know I'm trying to hate you
Trying to have a dream without you in it
But how can I put out this fire
When you're the one who lit it

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really OK when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be over you for real
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

I've got a stack of papers so high
And it's all about you baby
Keep thinking maybe I
Can make sense of something crazy
Something I can't get out of my Head
I write your name I write your name
Then I tear it all to shreds

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really OK when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be over you for real
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

And if you ever change your mind
And want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me
Why I shouldn't let you in

I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really OK 'cause I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be over you for real
'Til I do

I'll just wait for the day
I stop pretending
That I'm really OK when I'm not
Wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
'Til I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

"You Do"

Here I am, once again
In your driveway, thinking I should be leaving
I should go but it's so entertaining watching you breathing
You went and got to me like
The stupid song on the radio that you try to forget
But it sticks in your head
So goodbye, it's not goodnight
Cause I'll be seeing you in my dreamin'

Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my friends, tell them all about you
Always looking like a one of those nights
When you're thinkin' about a kiss 'til the morning light
You got me, you do

In a daze, pull the shades
Close my eyes and picture you at my window
I relax; I go back to all the things you said
That only I know

Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my all my friends, tell them all about you
Always looking like a one of those nights
When you're thinkin' about a kiss 'til the morning light
You got me, you do

I run right out to my car
And I pull out the drive
It's only been ten minutes
But I have to see you one more time

Cause you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin' so bad, I spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my all my friends, tell them all about you
And it's looking like a one of those nights
When you're thinkin' about a kiss 'til the morning light
You got me, you do
Oh, you got me, you do

"Your Anything"

I bet you lie awake at night
Trying to make up your sweet mind
Wondering if you'll ever find
Just what you want
A home-town number one
Or a California loaded gun
But you know you only get one
Or that's what you thought
But here's what you've got

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything

If you want hard to get
If you want
All you have to do is let me know
If you want a bumpy ride
Or someone with a softer side
Either one'll be alright
Just let me know
'Cause this is where it goes

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything

It's not like I'm giving up who I am for you
But for someone like you it's just so easy to do

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need

If that's what you need

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything

"Your Face"

I heard a song tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
She sees his face
In every space
Every room

And I know if I turn around you won't be there
If I close my eyes will you be there?

I don't wanna lose your face
And I don't wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't wanna turn around
'Cause I'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I don't wanna lose your face

I've got a picture of you in my bedroom
And I hope it never falls
I hope I never lose that feeling
I used to get when you would call

And now I wonder to myself
Who were you? Where are you?
Were you ever here at all?

I don't wanna lose your face
And I don't wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't wanna turn around
'Cause I'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I don't wanna lose your face

That girl in the song had it so good
I wish I could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And I had you

I don't wanna lose your face
I don't wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't wanna turn around
'Cause I'm not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I don't wanna lose your face

I don't wanna lose your face
I don't wanna turn around
