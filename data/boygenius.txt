"Bite The Hand"

I can't hear you, you're too far away
I can't see you, the light is in my face
I can't touch you, I wouldn't if I could

I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to

Here's the best part, distilled for you
But you want what I can't give to you
Your hands are grabbing while my hands are tied

I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to

Who do you think you are?
Who do you think I am?
What do you want to say?
What do you think will change?
Maybe I'm afraid of you
Maybe I'm afraid of you

I'll bite the hand that feeds me
Bite the hand that feeds me
Bite the hand
Bite the hand
Bite the hand that needs me
Bite the hand that needs me
Bite the hand
Bite the hand

I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to
I can't love you how you want me to

I can't love you how you want me to

"Me & My Dog"

We had a great day
Even though we forgot to eat
And you had a bad dream
And we got no sleep
'Cause we were kissing

I had a fever
Until I met you
Now you make me cool
But sometimes I still do
Something embarrassing

I never said I'd be all right
Just thought I could hold myself together
When I couldn't breathe, I went outside
Don't know why I thought it'd be any better
I'm fine now, it doesn't matter

I didn't wanna be this guy
I cried at your show with the teenagers
Tell your friend I'll be all right
In the morning it won't matter

I wanna be emaciated
I wanna hear one song without thinking of you
I wish I was on a spaceship
Just me and my dog and an impossible view

I dream about it
And I wake up falling

"Souvenir"

[Julien Baker:]
Dreamcatcher on the rearview mirror
Hasn't caught a thing yet
Twenty dollars and a souvenir
Anything's worth trying

To stay out of your nightmares
Say I was in your dream last night
Always end up dying
You said, because of course I did
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh

[Phoebe Bridgers:]
Always managed to move in
Right next to cemeteries
And never far from a hospital
I don't know what that tells you about me

[Lucy Dacus:]
Pulling thorns out of my palm
Work a midnight surgery
When you cut a hole into my skull
Do you hate what you see?
Like I do
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh

"Stay Down"

Wasn't a fighter until somebody told me
I had better learn to lean into the punch
So it don't hurt as bad when they leave
There you were, turning your cheek

I look at you and you look at a screen
I'm in the back seat of my body
I'm just steering my life in a video game
Similar acts and a different name

It's a slow down

So would you teach me I'm the villain, aren't I?
Aren't I the one constantly repenting for a difficult mind?
Push me down into the water like a sinner, hold me under
And I'll never come up again

I'll just stay down

It's a half life, it's a fallout
It takes so long for me to settle down
And when I finally do, there's no one else around

So I stay down
So I stay down
So I stay down
So I stay down
So I stay down

"Salt In The Wound"

You put salt in the wound
And a kiss on my cheek
You butter me up
And you sit down to eat
You add insult to injury
You say you believe in me
But you haven't decided
About taking or leaving me

But you take and you take
Like silks up my sleeve
Tied corner to corner, never ending
Trick after trick, I make the magic
And you unrelentingly ask for the secret

Neck full of mockingbirds
All calling your name
I tried to sing it all back
Like I heard it, it don't sound the same
I'm gnashing my teeth
Like a child of Cain
If this is a prison, I'm willing to buy my own chain

But you take and you take
Like silks up my sleeve
Tied corner to corner, never ending
Trick after trick, I make the magic
And you unrelentingly ask for the secret

They say the hearts and minds are on your side
They say the finish line is in your sights
What they don't say is what's on the other side
They say the hearts and minds are on your side

"Ketchum, ID"

'Kay

Back in the States now
In a college town
I would walk around
But it's really coming down
Mesmerized by double lines
Two yellow tightropes
I'm making good time

I am never anywhere
Anywhere I go
When I'm home, I'm never there
Long enough to know

Being in love
Is the same thing as being alone
Giving the sorrow some company
Nothing to say
But stay on the phone
No, I'm sorry I do not know
What else you want from me

I am never anywhere
Anywhere I go
When I'm home, I'm never there
Long enough to know

You say, "How are you?"
I say, "I don't know
Let's dissolve the band
Move to Idaho"
Everyone's around
And I hear you smiling
You say, "I love you"
I say, "You too"

I am never anywhere
Anywhere I go
When I'm home, I'm never there
Long enough to know
Ooh-oh-oh-oh
Ooh-oh-oh-oh
I am never anywhere
Anywhere I go
When I'm home, I'm never there
Long enough

"Without You Without Them"

Give me everything you've got
I'll take what I can get
I want to hear your story and be a part of it

Thank your father before you
His mother before him
Who would I be without you, without them?

Speak to me, speak to me, speak to me
Until your history's no mystery to me

Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
Until the words run dry
We'll see eye to eye

I'll give everything I've got
Please take what I can give
I want you to hear my story and be a part of it

Thank my father before me
His mother before him
Who would I be without you, without them?

"$20"

It's a bad idea and I'm all about it
Give it one more chance and
Then I finally had it
When you wake up, I'll be gone again
Motorcycle in the front lawn

It's an all-night drive from your house to Reno
To the T-bird graveyard where we play with fire
In another life, we were arsonists
How long's the Chevy been on cinder blocks?

Mama told me that it don't run
On wishes but that I should have fun
Pushing the flowers that come up
Into the front of a shotgun
So many hills to die on

Run out of gas, out of time, out of money
You're doing what you can, just makin' it run
(Take a break, make your escape)
Gas, out of time, out of money
You're doing what you can, just makin' it run
(There's only so much I can
Take a break, make your escape)
May I please have twenty dollars?
Gas, out of time, out of money
You're doing what you can, just makin' it run
(There's only so much I can
Take a break, make your escape)
Can you give me twenty dollars?
(Gas, out of time, out of money
You're doing what you can, just makin' it run)
(There's only so much I can
Take a break, make your escape)
(Gas, out of time, out of money
You're doing what you can, just makin' it run)
(There's only so much I can
Take a break, make your escape)
I know you have twenty dollars
I know you have twenty dollars!

"Emily I'm Sorry"

She's asleep in the backseat
Looking peaceful enough to me
But she's wakin' up inside a dream
Full of screeching tires and fire
We're comin' back from where no one lives
Pretty much just veterans
When I pointed out where the North Star is
She called me a fuckin' liar

Emily (Emily), I'm sorry, I just
Make it up as I go along
Yet, I can feel myself becoming (I can feel)
Someone only you could want

Headed straight for the concrete
In a nightmare screaming
Now I'm wide awake, spiraling
And you don't wanna talk
Just take me back to Montr√©al
I'll get a real job, you'll go back to school
We can burn out in the freezing cold
And just get lost

Emily (Emily), I'm sorry, baby
You know how I get when I'm wrong (You know how I get)
And I can feel myself becoming (I can feel)
Somebody I'm not, I'm not, so
Emily (Emily), forgive me, can we
Make it up as we go along?
I'm twenty-seven and I don't know who I am (Don't know who I am)
But I know what I want

Emily, I'm sorry
Emily, I'm sorry
I'm sorry

"True Blue"

You said you wanted to feel alive
So we went to the beach
You were born in July, '95
In a deadly heat
You say you're a winter bitch
But summer's in your blood
You can't help but become the sun

When you moved to Chicago
You were spinnin' out
When you don't know who you are
You fuck around and find out
When you called me from the train
Water freezin' in your eyes
You were happy and I wasn't surprised

And it feels good to be known so well
I can't hide from you like I hide from myself

Now you're movin' in
Breakin' a sweat on your upper lip
And gettin' pissed about humidity
And the leaky faucet
You already hurt my feelings three times
In the way only you could

But it feels good to be known so well
I can't hide from you like I hide from myself
I remember who I am when I'm with you
Your love is tough, your love is tried and true blue
Blue

You've never done me wrong
Except for that one time
That we don't talk about
Because it doesn't matter anymore
Who won the fight? I don't know
We're not keeping score

And it feels good to be known so well
I can't hide from you like I hide from myself
I remember who I am when I'm with you
Your love is tough, your love is tried and true blue
(Blue, blue, blue)

"Cool About It"

Met you at the dive bar to go shoot some pool
And make fun of the cowboys with the neck tattoos
Ask you easy questions about work and school
I'm trying to be cool about feeling like an absolute fool about
Wishing you were kind enough to be cruel about it
Telling myself I can always do without it
Knowing that it probably isn't true

I came prepared for absolution if you'd only ask
So I take some offense when you say, "No regrets"
I remember it's impossible to pass your test
But I'm trying to forget about it
Feeling like I'm breaking a sweat about it
Wishing you would kindly get out of my head about it
Telling myself one day I'll forget about it
Knowing that it probably isn't true

Once I took your medication to know what it's like
And now I have to act like I can't read your mind
I ask you how you're doing and I let you lie
But we don't have to talk about it
I can walk you home and practice method acting
I'll pretend being with you doesn't feel like drowning
Telling you it's nice to see how good you're doing
Even though we know it isn't true

"Not Strong Enough"

Black hole opened in the kitchen
Every clock's a different time
It would only take the energy to fix it
I don't know why I am

The way I am
Not strong enough to be your man
I tried, I can't
Stop staring at the ceiling fan and
Spinning out about things that haven't happened
Breathing in and out

Drag racing through the canyon
Singing "Boys Don't Cry"
Do you see us getting scraped up off the pavement?
I don't know why I am

The way I am
Not strong enough to be your man
I lied, I am
Just lowering your expectations
Half a mind that keeps the other second guessing
Close my eyes and count

Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god

Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god

Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god
Always an angel, never a god

I don't know why I am the way I am
There's something in the static
I think I've been having revelations
Coming to in the front seat, nearly empty
Skip the exit to our old street and go home
Go home alone

"Revolution 0"

Mm, hmm, hmm, hmm

Imaginary friend
You live up in my head
So I've been making music
Since you told me to do it

I just want to know
Who broke your nose
Figure out where they live
So I can kick their teeth in

If it isn't love, then what the fuck is it?
I guess just let me pretend

I don't want to die
That's a lie
But I'm afraid to get sick
I don't know what that is

You wanted a song
So it's gonna be a short one
Wish I wasn't so tired
But I'm tired

If you're not enough
Then I give up and then nothing is

I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I

I used to think if I just closed my eyes
I would disappear

"Leonard Cohen"

On the on-ramp, you said
"If you love me, you will listen to this song."
And I could tell that you were serious so I
Didn't tell you you were driving the wrong way
On the interstate until the song was done

You felt like an idiot, adding an hour to the drive
But it gave us more time to embarrass ourselves
Telling stories we wouldn't tell anyone else
You said, "I might like you less now that you know me so well."
I might like you less now that you know me so well

Leonard Cohen once said, "There's a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in."
And I am not an old man having an existential crisis
At a Buddhist monastery writing horny poetry
But I agree
I never thought you'd happen to me
I never thought you'd happen to me

"Satanist"

Will you be a satanist with me?
Mortgage off your soul to buy your dream
Vacation home in Florida:
The collateral the devil's repossessing from me
Trying to score some off-brand ecstasy

Will you be an anarchist with me?
Sleep in cars and kill the bourgeoisie
At least until you find out what a fake I am
Spray-paint my initials on an ATM
I'd burn the cash and smash my old TV

Will you be a nihilist with me?
If nothing matters, man, that's a relief
Solomon had a point when he wrote Ecclesiastes
If nothing can be known, then stupidity is holy
If the void becomes a bore, we'll treat ourselves to some self-belief

Oh, you know what I should do

You wonder
If you can even be seen
From so far away
A slow pull, a seismic drift
Leaning over the edge of a continent
It's so hard to come back
You hang on until it drags
You under
You under
You under
You under

"We're In Love"

You could absolutely break my heart
That's how I know that we're in love
I don't need the symbol of a scar
So put down the knife
We're not swapping blood

Isn't it enough
That we stripped down to our skin
Cold and porcelain
Like bathers in a painting
And I told you of your past lives, every man you've ever been
It wasn't flattering
But you listened like it mattered

I feel crazy in ways I never say
Will you still love me if it turns out I'm insane?
I know what you'll say
But it helps to hear you say it, anyway

Some October, in the future, I'll run out of trash TV
And I'll be feeling lonely
So I'll walk to karaoke
Sing the song you wrote about me, never once checking the words
I hope that no one sings along
I hope that I am not a regular

Damn, that makes me sad
It doesn't have to be like that
If you rewrite your life, may I still play a part?

In the next one, will you find me?
I'll be the boy with the pink carnation pinned to my lapel
Who looks like hell
And asks for help
And if you do
I'll know it's you

I can't imagine you without
The same smile in your eyes
There is something about you
That I will always recognize
And if you don't remember
I will try to remind you
Of the hummingbirds
You know the ones
And the baby scorpion
And the winter lunar halo
And the walk we took in the Redwoods
I could go on and on and on and I will
Go on and on and on until
It all comes back

"Anti-Curse"

Getting deep
I'm out of my depth at a public beach
I never listened, I had to see for myself
It's coming in waves
Shoots through my mind like a pinball straight
Friendly fire, point blank

Salt in my lungs
Holding my breath
Making peace with my inevitable death

I guess I did alright, considering
Tried to be a halfway decent friend
Wound up a bad comedian
An honest fool with more bad habits than you can count

There we were
Was anyone ever so young?
Breaking curfew with illegal fireworks
Unpacking God in the suburbs

I'm swimming back

You say you don't have to make it bad
Just 'cause you know how

Writing the words
To the worst love song you've ever heard
Sounding out the foreign characters
An incantation like an anti-curse
Or even a blessing

"Letter To An Old Poet"

I said I think that you're special
You told me once that I'm selfish
And I kissed you hard
In the dark
In the closet

You said my music is mellow
Maybe I'm just exhausted
You think you're a good person
Because you won't punch me in the stomach

And I love you
I don't know why
I just do

But you're not special, you're evil
You don't get to tell me to calm down
You make me feel like an equal
But I'm better than you and you should know that by now

When you fell down the stairs
It looked like it hurt and I wasn't sorry
I should've left you right there
With your hostages: my heart and my car keys

You don't know me
I wanna be happy
I'm ready
To walk into my room without looking for you
I'll go up to the top of our building
And remember my dog when I see the full moon

I can't feel it yet
But I am waiting

"Black Hole"

In a rainstorm
Sucking down a dart
On the back porch
Out here, it gets so dark
You can see the stars, the ones the headlines said
This morning were being spat out
By what we thought was just destroying everything for good

White teeth
Black light
White tee
Brown eyes
Bad boy
Big fight
You're a
Good guy

Good day
Good night
Good talk
Goodbye
It's out of your hands, but
Have a
Safe flight

My thoughts
All noise
Fake smile
Decoys
Sometimes
I need
To hear
Your voice

"Afraid Of Heights"

I know that I fucked up when I
Told you I'm afraid of heights
It made you wanna test my courage
You made me climb a cliff at night
You wanted me to jump and I declined
You called me a coward, I replied
"I don't wanna live forever
But I don't wanna die tonight"

When the black water ate you up
Like a sugar cube in a teacup
I got the point you were makin'
When I held my breath 'til you came up

There's been a run of fires downtown
On half-built construction sites
I know you never liked a townhouse
I've seen you climb a crane at night
If they ever catch you at it
I know you'd want me to be proud
That you took a rich man's dream
And brought it with you on your way down

"'Cause one man's dream is another man's death"
I remember when you told me that
Didn't know what to say, so I just laughed
But now I know it's not funny

I never rode a motorcycle
I've never smoked a cigarette
I wanna live a vibrant life
But I wanna die a boring death
I know I was a disappointment
Know you wanted me to take a risk
Not everybody gets the chance to live
A life that isn't dangerous

You called me a crybaby
But you're the one who got teary
Tellin' me what you believe
How we're stuck in entropy
How it hurts to hope
Oh, it hurts to hope for more
Oh, it hurts to hope the future
Will be better than before

"Voyager"

Mmm, mmm

It's a hundred and three in the Valley
Blacktop is meltin' on our shoes (Mmm)
And I don't mean to make it all about me (Mmm)
But I used to believe no one could love you like I do (Mmm)
And I'm startin' to think that it might be impossible not to (Mmm)

There are days spent tangled up together (Mmm)
And sometimes, you let me read your mind (Ooh)
Then there are nights you say you don't remember
When you stepped on the gas and you asked if I'm ready to die (Mmm)
You thought I'd never leave and I let you believe you were right (Mmm)

Walkin' alone in the city
Makes me feel like a man on the moon (Ooh)
Every small step I took was so easy (Mmm)
But I never imagined a dot quite as pale or as blue (Ooh)
You took it from me, but I would've given it to you (Mmm)

"Powers"

How did it start? Did I fall into a nuclear reactor?
Crawl out with acid skin or somethin' worse
A hostile alien ambassador?
Or am I simply another of the universe's failed experiments?
Either way, I have been wonderin' just how it is (How it is)
I have never heard (Never heard) the tale of how I got my powers

Thrust into bein', careenin' along
On a crooked little trajectory
Dissolvin' in movement, a body in orbit
Or a roach on his way to the gutter

The tail of a comet burned up in an instant, the destruction of matter
There's no object to be seen in the supercollider
Just a light in the tunnel and whatever gets scattered
Life flashin' before the eye of whatever comes after
The force of our impact, the fission
The hum of our contact, the sound of our collisions

"Boyfriends"

She's out on the back deck
Talking to her marigolds
Sitting in a sundress
Listening to bands nobody knows

You don't have to do that
They're either gonna die or they will grow
Guess you're talking to yourself then
You can never stand to be alone
Time can be a savage
It will bring you peace but makes you old
Hell is gonna have it
She says, "Get a fucking job or just come home"

But you're not gonna go back
You never liked the freezing snow
Stuck out in the midwest
Standing at another house show

You always wanna save them
You think that you can change them
I think you're blaming yourself
But you say the medication, it helps

Calling in the morning
Asking me to analyze your dreams
What happened to your boyfriend?
You don't think about him when you sleep
I guess that's why you're sleeping
I guess that's why you're gardening
Back out on the coast again
Looking for a second chance

You always wanna save them
You think that you can change them
I think you're blaming yourself
But you say the medication, it helps

What happened to your boyfriend?
What happened to your boyfriend?
What happened to your boyfriend?
What happened to your boyfriend?
