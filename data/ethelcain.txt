"Dog Days"

I think of you while you're at work
Out in the fields, tearing up the earth
But I like you best when you're at home
Giving it to me so nice and fucking slow

No one's ever gonna love me, no not like you do
Every night I'm crying in my sleep 'cause I'm dreaming about you
And I've tried so hard to quit you like I promised my mama I would
But it's no good, it's no good

You walk a fine line between god and animal
You're just a feral dog I worship in bedroom ceremonials
Cut me up and take me like the bread and blood at church
Love's never been more than pain, so baby, show me how bad you hurt

No one's ever gonna love me, no not like you do
Every night I'm crying in my sleep 'cause I'm still dreaming about you
And I've tried so hard to quit you like I promised my mama I would
But it's no good, it's no good
It's no good, it's no good
We're no good
You're no good
I'm no good
We're no good

"Misuse Oh"

I told you from the start
I disappear when it gets cold
But you found a way to keep me here
With a body to hold

And I think of you
When I'm drunk in the road in front of your old house
I miss what you'd do to me
When I was in need of you and blacked out

I miss you, darling
I miss you so
I'm sorry I went crazy
I just thought I'd let you know

Taking pictures while you sleep
Leftovers on the table, strangers on the TV
I'm bleeding from my ears
Sneaking out while you're asleep 'cause you're my biggest fear

And I think of you
When I'm drunk in the road in front of your old house
I miss what you'd do to me
When I was in need of you and blacked out

I miss you, darling
I miss you so
I miss you, darling

"Antlers"

Daddy, there's pain in your smile
I've never seen you so dark
You'll never walk me down the aisle
You won't make it that far
Mama took the keys and she ran
The baby's blood is on your hands
We both know it's what you deserve

I tried to pull you out
But you built this bed to rot
Look at this hell you've caused
And you'll blame yourself cause

It's all your fault
It's all your fault
It's all your fault
It's all your fault

"Sunday Morning"

Swaying softly, streetlights glowing through my windows
Trying on each dress I bought for you
Do I look pretty
When I ask you to hit me?

Hands like barbed wire
Wrapped around my throat, making me cry like I told you I wanted in the car, on the long drive home
Baby, we're alone now

Sunday morning, everything hurts except for you
Except for you
Except for you
Except for you

And I like thinking I'm no different from you
Different from you
Different from you
When I go home at night I think about the ways that I can get out
Of the hold you've got me in
Of the hold you've got me in

You've still got time, waiting on the other side
You'll still be alright, if you just make it to the other side
You'll still be alright, even after all this time
You'll still be alright, you'll still be alright

Sunday morning, nothing hurts, not even you
No, not even you
No, not even you

"Casings"

Am I not good enough for you?
Is there something wrong with me?
You say, "Don't cry, you know you're mine"
Baby, don't you lie to me

Am I just not what you want?
Am I just not what you need?
Is there someone who has your heart
That keeps you gone away from me?

Is she prettier than me?
Is her skin softer than mine?
Can she give you what I can't?
The things I cry for every night?

Is it something in how she moves
When you're undressed inside her house?
Does she smile the way I do
When she has you in her mouth?

Do you not love me like you did
When you told me that it's fine?
That I've been hurt, cause you've been too?
And that kind of pain, you don't mind?

I think about you every day
'Cause I love you more than I thought I could
And now that you're gone, I wanna die
'Cause I don't hate you like I know I should

Was I not good enough for you?
Was there something wrong with me?
I just cry by myself at night
But you'll never know and you'll never see

"Lilies"
(feat. Mercy Necromancy)

Tell me I'm no one else's but yours
Watching me undress standing in the door
Wedding doves and leather gloves and all the things you're made up of
What a wondrous thing to be in love

You're like an angel
Nothing can touch you
But I want to hold you
I want to love you
You're like an angel
I can't come close to you
You know my weakness
But you don't know what I'd do

You're such an angel
And I'm gonna hurt you
I know I'm gonna lose you
But God, don't want to

Lilies grow all over the room
And when you come inside, they bloom
There is nothing that I want but you
Tell me can I be seen through

You're like an angel
Nothing can touch you
But I want to hold you
I want to love you
You're like an angel
I can't come close to you
You know my weakness
But you don't know what I'd do

You're such an angel
And I'm gonna hurt you
I know I'm gonna lose you
But God, I don't want to

"Head In The Wall"

Sometimes you make me wanna put my fucking head through the wall
Sometimes I wonder if I even know you at all
Fall asleep to the sound of your old rotating fan
I cut the fuck out of myself, and soaked the bed sheets with blood again

I hold my head underwater just to drown out the noise
It's always my fault, girls will be bitches, and boys will be boys
I know I don't need you but I'm terrified of letting you go
Even after all the times you fucked the shit out of me while I was crying "No"

And how am I supposed to feel good about myself when everything I do is wrong
When I'm just an ugly bitch, a fucking freak, and I don't wanna go on
And I don't wanna leave my house cause I know everybody's staring at me now
"Why the hell am I alive?" is what they think, they wanna take me down

And I can't get out, can't run away, there's no escaping you now
(There's no escaping you now)
I'm gonna die all alone, next to you, in this piece of shit town
And we've been cursed since the start, Jesus didn't want us, no
And you take all of your sins out on my body, like everyone else does
Shooting up our old school when we get bored of shooting up
And fuck the cops, and fuck God, and fuck this town for ruining us
And they'll put holes in all we own and in our heads, pumped full of lead
You always told me I could only leave you once we're both dead

Sometimes you make wanna put my fucking head through the wall
Sometimes I wonder if I ever even knew you at all

"Knuckle Velvet"
(feat. Yah Wav)

Nothing hurts like you do, like the way you say I love you
Leave the room half undressed, I'm saying prayers through a throttled neck
Come into the room and make me cry all over again

You come in so hard, gore me through the heart
Just another day and you'll still tell me you're healing
See it on your face, you won't ever change in your ways
Shed your knuckle velvet, torn on my teeth
When you're torn apart, you'll destroy me again

Bleeding out on your sleeve, you kill me any way but softly
With all your crying like you did that first night I made you spend on your own
You're such a child and you know it

Nothing in my heart is hoping you'll come back
Too cold to know what I don't have without you, no
Without you
Every drop of blood is love I don't get back
Bated to take the love that I gave away to save you

"Selby Wall"

There comes a point in every girl's life where she just wants to go fucking feral
Take a man between her hands and rip that motherfucker's limbs from him
And every time I let you fuck me, I think about how easy it would be to take your life away from you
Which I'd never do, unless you force me to

You never tell me that I'm pretty, you just say you like my tits
And every time I cry you say "don't be a little bitch"
But I'm still stupid and in love and I'd still let you fuck me 'til I'm cumming blood

But baby, one of these days I'm gonna crack
And cut you up with a rusty saw in my daddy's shed and bury the pieces out back
Lie on your grave and masturbate and think of all the things we could have been
Cause baby, if you fuck me over I'll make sure that you can't do it again

There comes a point in every man's life where he gets the need to destroy
Some sickness in his guts that started growing when he was just a little boy
And all the times you bruised my throat and pulled my hair until it broke and held me down and fucked me 'til I was on the brink of death
Cause when you fuck, you fuck until there's nothing left

You never tell me that I'm pretty, you just say you love my ass
And you go on and on about some girl that you fucked in the past
You're such a man, I bet that I could fuck her better than you can

But baby, one of these days I'm gonna crack
Cut you up with a rusty saw in my daddy's shed and bury the pieces out back
Lie on your grave and masturbate and think of all the things we could have been
Cause baby, if you fuck me over I'll make sure that you can't do it again

And I saw her downtown and asked her out, went to her house and we fucked in her bed
She's sweeter than you'll ever be when I give her kisses between her legs
You don't deserve such pretty things when you all you do is shoot to kill
She'll love me and I'll love her better than you could, I promise you I will

And baby, I told you one of these days I swore I was gonna crack
That I'd take you from your crying mother and I'd never give you back
She and I lie on your grave and masturbate and think of all the things we'll do
Now that we've moved on, now that you're gone, now that we know we're better off without you

"Child Of Cain"

Paint my Sistine Chapel white
On my couch all night
Show me love
In whatever way it comes to you
As long as you hold me tight

I know your father hurt you
You say that's why God gave you me
You say I make it a little better
You say I make you happy
You say it with your fingers clenched
Wrapped tight around my neck
'Cause that's what love means to you
And I asked for it I guess

Oh oh
Beautiful, sweet, child of Cain
All you know is how to feel and how to deal
Out pain

I take my mother's scissors
Carve your name into my chest
'Cause I think you're so amazing
'Cause I think that you're the best
And the way you hurt me softly
Brings back such sweet memories
Of how the angels in my room and I
Would play when I was three
And if I try hard as I can
I think that I can make believe
That what we have is really love
'Cause what else could it even be?

It'd be impossible to live
Without you here with me
And it doesn't even matter
That with or without you I can't breathe

Oh oh
Beautiful, sweet, child of Cain
All you know is how to feel and how to deal
Out pain

"Michelle Pfeiffer"
(feat. lil aaron)

[Ethel Cain:]
Everything's easier way out west
Wholly mad and half undressed
I love the way it always feels to miss you
I tell all my friends everything you do
A sick obsession that I still try to prove
But it's no good, 'cause who am I without you?

And home's not home unless you're there
And I'll never be ready but I don't care
Wide awake all night thinking about you
Do you think of me too?
I hate to let you go, but if I don't
Then we both know
I'll bury us both, fed to the night
As ghosts

[lil aaron:]
I keep on losing track of time
Cause what's the point if you're not by my side?
I told my mom about you, she just laughed
Driving with my eyes closed, hope I crash
Maybe we could be together in another life
Maybe this could be forever in another timeline
But right now, I gotta pack my bags
And I won't even miss you tomorrow

[Ethel Cain:]
'Cause home's not home unless you're there
And I'll never be ready but I don't care
Wide awake all night thinking about you
Do you think of me too?
I hate to let you go, but if I don't
Then we both know
I'll bury us both, fed to the night
As ghosts

Washed out days and stone-cold nights
Best goddamn days of your whole life
Jack the car and let it ride
Kicking it, baby, we'll survive
I'm all run and you're all fight
Tangling with Jesus Christ
Total ruin idolized
But the kids will be alright

'Cause home's not home unless you're there
And I'll never be ready but I don't care
Wide awake all night thinking about you
Do you think of me too?
I hate to let you go, but if I don't
Then we both know
I'll bury us both, fed to the night
As ghosts

"Crush"

His window's already passed
So he's shooting at the glass
Keeping guns in his locker
And he denies it
Like it's actually important
But he lied 'cause I sure did watch him
Showing up wearing black
And he knows that

His daddy's on death row
But he'll say it with his chest, though
His friends move dope
He hasn't tried coke
But he's always had a problem saying no
His older brother bagged the valedictorian
His mother steady screaming he should be more like him

Can you read my mind? I've been watching you
(You know it, you know it, you know it, you know it's true)
Couldn't fight to save your life but you look so cool
Camo jacket robbing corner stores
Hard odds to beat when you're on all fours
Good men die too so I'd rather be with you

I owe you a black eye and two kisses
Tell me when you wanna come and get em
I only want him if he says it first to me
I wanna (oh) him in the back of his mom's Mercury
He looks like he works with his hands
And smells like Marlboro reds
It makes me so (oh) and I can't get enough of it

Something's been feeling weird lately
There's just something about you, baby
Maybe I'll just be crazy
And piss him off 'til he hates me
(Yeah right, he fucking loves me)
Low slung bad bitch, baby come and get you some

Can you read my mind? I've been watching you
Couldn't fight to save your life but you look so cool
(You know it, you know it, you know)
Camo jacket robbing corner stores
Hard odds to beat when you're on all fours
Good men die too so I'd rather be with you

Oh, I'd rather be with you
Oh, I'd rather be with you
'Cause good men die too so I'd rather be with you

"God's Country"
(feat. Wicca Phase Springs Eternal)

The road is longer than it is hard
With no one to guide you
And no one to hold
No best foot forward to sway the odds
And just a voice inside you
And a stone to throw

Could you be someone else
If someone else is what I need?
But I shouldn't ask that of you
When you're old you'll understand
But we're hurting now so what are we to do 'til then?
Cradling pictures of you

It was a highway to nowhere, and we rode it
Cold car with no gas and we chose it
Soft bodies playing in the street
Our kids will grow up with half as much
Trying to build something out of dust
Finding out too late what they need

You've tasted love and it tasted sweet
You drank the blood and bit the meat
You hold it, you hold it, you let it go
You close your eyes and count to three
You say the word and come to me
Baby, I know

Drive the pathway through the pines
And the moors of mystery
Welcome conflict and let crisis come
And shake the ground beneath
And the family secret hiding
In the farmhouse down the street
Rushes open door on your front porch
And shadows me
Taken and entirely I embraced the bonny beast
Over hills and highlands, we rode hard the passing peaks
Danger like the virgin wife, beside me she would sleep
Cherry was her dad's truck that she crashed at seventeen
I kneel before what temper broke the branches on the beach
And those thrilling highs and southern nights are always out of reach

I learned a lesson
I need to pray hard, final hours
Take care of me god
Take care of me god

You've tasted love and it tasted sweet
You drank the blood and bit the meat
You hold it, you hold it, you let it go
You close your eyes and count to three
You say the word and come to me
Baby, I know

The road is longer than it is hard
(Love overwhelms me)
With no one to guide you
(It's all that I want, and it's all that we have)
No best foot forward to sway the odds
(But is it enough)
Just a voice inside you
(To make it worth it in the end)
Don't sink in me with your dog teeth
Don't sink in me with your dog teeth
Don't sink in me with your dog teeth
Don't sink in me
Don't sink in me with your dog teeth

You've tasted love and it tasted sweet
You drank the blood and bit the meat
You hold it, you hold it, but you'll never know
You close your eyes and cry to me
Don't sink in me with your dog teeth
We're better off if you let go
In God's country
In God's country

If it was harder then
It will be better now
For I am here and changed
I couldn't tell you how
There before the grace of God go I
Laughing to myself
Forgetting what about
No best foot forward to sway the odds
And just a voice inside you
And a stone to throw

"Unpunishable"

Down bad and nasty
Sacrificial angel, dirty slut with needs
In a convocation or a room alone
Call me what you want and I'll be that
Sucking on his teeth, he needs it so bad
He's screaming "Party's over, go the fuck home"

The darker the fruit, the sweeter
I ask him if he's ok with that
He's mean, I'm meaner
My baby says that he's not afraid of that
I say "You're right, in a way"
Giving it up on top of him
He says "How so, babe?"
He wants to know how

Babe
I'm too good for you
And it makes me need it even more
Whose is it now
It's yours
Red and blue
Used and abused
It's still never enough
I'm unpunishable

Swollen up with envy
Says I'm his favorite
Yeah I fucking better be
Drifting just right out of sight
Show me where it hurts and I'll
Lick it better
In the red light

Numb faces in a dark bar
We don't even know where we are
I don't even know who you are

I don't even know who you are babe
I'm too good for you
And it makes me need it even more
Whose is it now
It's yours
Red and blue
Used and abused
It's still never enough
I'm unpunishable

"Inbred"

Bare naked under my nightgown
Pissing on the stove to put it out
Watching him through holes in his door
Sucking on the back of his leg to stay warm

Older brother made a name for himself with the cops
Scumbag fuck but I swear that he's not
He's so good to me and to nobody else
So you should watch yourself
Mama's comatose, she can't leave the bed
Something smells rotten and it's starting to spread
I'm bad, he's worse, we're already dead
We're already dead

We wake up and all the fucking lights are out

You can't win 'em all
Who knows how much longer
I'll lay on the floor
Touch me 'til I vomit
I'm not scared of god
I'm scared he was gone all along
Who will take the fall
Who of us is stronger
You'll just want it more
If you could, you'd have fought it
But you know you're not
From the start, they knew you were wrong
You were wrong

Older brother made a name for himself with the feds
White trash dick but I love him to death
He's so good to me and to nobody else
So you can fuck yourself
You get off on innocence so you savor this
Does your baby know her daddy's a rapist?
He hates the way you look at me
You're already dead
You're already dead

If he wakes up, he'll show you what I'm talking about

You can't win 'em all
Who knows how much longer
I'll lay on the floor
Touch me 'til I vomit
(Touch me 'til) I'm not scared of god
I'm scared he was gone all along
Who will take the fall
Who of us is stronger
You'll just want it more
If you could, you'd have fought it
But you know you're not
From the start, they knew you were wrong
You were wrong
You were wrong
You were wrong

"Two-Headed Mother"

You know
You know
You know
You know

You think that you create the waves
But I create you
Two-headed mother in your bed
You know she hates you
Kissing tyrannical heads spitting at you
Babe, fire you wade through
The ways I fuck myself and get down good
Never need to mind you
I've loved before, I'll kill again
You're just the worst of all my men
I'm not gon' pull you out the den so they don't bite you
I won't feel good again until I'm up inside you

I love you
I love you
I love you
I'll love 'til I'm sore
I don't love you
I don't love you
I don't love you
I don't love you no more

Two-headed mother pulled you from the black
And she can send you back

"Crying During Sex"

I sing the lord's euthanasia blues
When I take you and your brother in the back pew
Drive into the median, keep myself from eating and wonder why I feel so sick
Tradition's ligature marks always yellow through

I lied when I said I didn't want you
In no time, you'll forget the way we were supposed to be
Asking what I'm on this time, holding on to you like I do
Like we're the only people in the world god left to mind to

Two drowning coals won't ever light
But if I ask you to, you'll warm the night

If I want you like I said I'd never do
I would hold my breath and sit down next to you
Terrified you'll bite the hand that needs you
And right now I need you
I don't know what happened
I don't know what happened
I was young and sweet
And then something happened
Something overwhelming
Something everlasting

Time drags on
I hate him for the time he's gone
I've been here for weeks, I've been here for years
I've been here too long
I forgot what stop means
Either I drink it or the boat sinks
It's easy for him to get out of me
What I've been praying will get out of me

Will I always be crying during sex with you
All my dreams take place in heaven where it's quiet, lying next to you
Heavy breathing and sighs, bruises between my thighs, look me deep in my eyes like I'm a river worth wading
And if I'm crying, it's because I'm in love

And I could love you if I tried
And I'm trying
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying

"Earnhardt"

First you've got to do it for Dale...
Raise hell, praise Dale...

Love is a nightmare and all that you've got
Still getting lost in a bare parking lot
And the vertigo's fun til' you want it to stop
Praying this is the end when you know it's not

I could be good but it wouldn't matter
There's no silver line on a fucking disaster
I hope that you're happy, glad you can forget
While I'm spending my nights reliving it

Been scared of the dark for all of my life
I'm digging my grave by all of the lights
I'm always afraid but never to die
But not just yet so I'll be

Twirling around my room again
Spraying blood like the food court fountain
Forgive me, my trespasses
Holding me down through a hole in the mattress
You think you're someone else
That it only hurts when it hurts yourself
Americanized, Jesus Christ
Born to lie, so you lie and you lie and you lie and

You need easy, you want weak
When you were hungry, I was soft and pink
I bleed easy, I go weak
You look hungry then back to me
If I fall, I fall hard
Onto you and then all apart
But when the room went dark
And I needed you...
Where were you?

Twirling around my room again
Spraying blood like the food court fountain
Forgive me, my trespasses
Holding me down through a hole in the mattress
You think you're someone else
That it only hurts when it hurts yourself
Americanized, Jesus Christ
Born to lie, so you lie and you lie and you lie and

"Age Of Delilah"

There comes a day you sneak out but you don't go home
Where you're out past the streetlights, running down the road and your daddy won't know
It hurts to grow up, when your knees are still cut
But for us, life's never been without blood

Getting life's cold goodbye wave from the dark of the driveway
Crying, I'm no good at goodbyes, so I leave it to the lights
Can you just tell me which way I'm driving
Interstate or the highway, I'm going, I'm ready

There comes a day you find out that you don't wanna die
They'll say it's time you finally grew up, you've been gone for quite a while, but they'll never ask you why
They ask how it felt to suffocate myself
But not everything feels like something else

Getting life's cold goodbye wave from the dark of the driveway
Crying, I'm no good at goodbyes, so I leave it to the lights
Can you just tell me which way I'm driving
Interstate or the highway, I'm going, I'm ready

20 'til midnight at gas stations
Praying to a stranger's dogs in the parking lot
I asked have I done enough for salvation
They said you'll die if you leave it up to God
Said I've been drinking from this river 'til I bled it dry
But they looked me dead in my eyes and said
It doesn't matter if the grass is greener on the other side
As long as it's alive

So give it one last goodbye wave, in the light of the highway
Crying, I'm no good at goodbyes, but I've waited my whole life
So you just tell me which way I'm driving
Interstate or the highway, we're going, we're ready

"Michelle Pfeiffer (Solo Version)"

Everything's easier way out west
Wholly mad and half undressed
I love the way it always feels to miss you
I tell all my friends everything you do
A sick obsession that I still try to prove
But it's no good, 'cause who am I without you?

And home's not home unless you're there
And I'll never be ready but I don't care
Wide awake all night thinking about you
Do you think of me too?
I hate to let you go, but if I don't
Then we both know
I'll bury us both, fed to the night
As ghosts

I see you, I feel you, I know you
And I would never tell you the truth
That tunnelled light will always die with your youth
You don't know the things I've seen
So let go of the woe and hand it back over to me
You missed the heart and you just hit all the meat
And the bite back's twice as mean

'Cause home's not home unless you're there
And I'll never be ready but I don't care
Wide awake all night thinking about you
Do you think of me too?
I hate to let you go, but if I don't
Then we both know
I'll bury us both, fed to the night
As ghosts

Washed out days and stone-cold nights
Best goddamn days of your whole life
Jack the car and let it ride
Kicking it, baby, we'll survive
I'm all run and you're all fight
Tangling with Jesus Christ
Total ruin idolized
But the kids will be alright

'Cause home's not home unless you're there
And I'll never be ready but I don't care
Wide awake all night thinking about you
Do you think of me too?
I hate to let you go, but if I don't
Then we both know
I'll bury us both, fed to the night
As ghosts

"Family Tree (Intro)"

These crosses all over my body
Remind me of who I used to be
And Christ forgive these bones I'm hiding
From no one successfully

Jesus can always reject his father
But he cannot escape his mother's blood
He'll scream and try to wash it off of his fingers
But he'll never escape what he's made up of

The fate's already fucked me sideways
Swinging by my neck from the family tree
He'll laugh and say, "You know I raised you better than this"
Then leave me hanging so they all can laugh at me

"American Teenager"

Grew up under yellow light on the street
Putting too much faith in the make-believe
And another high school football team
The neighbor's brother came home in a box
But he wanted to go, so maybe it was his fault
Another red heart taken by the American dream

And I feel it there
In the middle of the night
When the lights go out and I'm all alone again

Say what you want, but say it like you mean it
With your fists for once, a long cold war
With your kids at the front
Just give it one more day, then you're done
Done
I do what I want, crying in the bleachers
And I said it was fun
I don't need anything from anyone, it's just not my year
But I'm all good out here

Sunday morning
Hands over my knees in a room full of faces
I'm sorry if I sound off, but I was probably wasted
And didn't feel so good
Head full of whiskey but I always deliver
Jesus, if you're listening let me handle my liquor
And Jesus, if you're there, why do I feel alone in this room with you?

And I feel it there
In the middle of the night
When the lights go out
But I'm still standing here

Say what you want, but say it like you mean it
With your fists for once, a long cold war
With your kids at the front
Just give it one more day, then you're done
Done
I do what I want, crying in the bleachers
And I said it was fun
I don't need anything from anyone
It's just not my year
But I'm all good out here

Say what you want, but say it like you mean it
With your fist for once
A long cold war
With your kids at the front
Just give it one more day, then you're done
I do it for my daddy and I do it for Dale
I'm doing what I want and damn, I'm doing it well
For me, for me
For me, for me

"A House In Nebraska"

Labored breaths and bed sores
Sing it to me all day long
When the aching sound of silence
Used to be our favorite song
You and me against the world
You were my man and I your girl
We had nothing except each other
You were my whole world
But then the day came
And you were up and gone

And I still call home that house in Nebraska
Where we found each other on a dirty mattress on the second floor
Where the world was empty
Save you and I
Where you came and I laughed, and you left, and I cried
Where you told me even if we died tonight, that I'd die yours

These dirt roads are empty
The ones we paved ourselves
Your mama calls me sometimes
To see if I'm doing well
And I lie to her
And say that I'm doing fine
When really I'd kill myself
To hold you one more time
And it hurts to miss you
But it's worse to know
That I'm the reason
You won't come home

But I still call home that house in Nebraska
Where we found each other on a dirty mattress on the second floor
(When I needed you, and I need you still)
Where the world was empty
Save you and I
Where you came and I laughed, and you left, and I cried
Where you told me even if we died tonight, that I'd die yours
(So I died there under you, every night, all night)

You know, I still wait at the edge of town
Praying straight to God that maybe you'll come back around
I cry every day, and the bottles make it worse
'Cause you were the only one I was never scared to tell I hurt
And I found photographs of our school, on the day we met
I thought that you were so beautiful, it was love, I guess
And you might never come back home, and I may never sleep at night
But God, I just hope you're doing fine out there, I just pray that you're all right

And I feel so alone
And I feel so alone out here
I feel so alone
And I feel so alone out here
And I feel so alone without you
I'm so alone out here
I feel so alone, I feel so alone
I'm so alone out here without you, baby

(I'm alone)

"Western Nights"

He's never looked more beautiful
On his Harley in the parking lot
Breaking in to the ATMs
Sleeping naked when it gets too hot
I watched him show his love through shades of black and blue
Starting fights at the bar across the street like you do
The neighbors beat on the wall while I'm face-first in the bed
Show me how much I mean to you, while I'm lying in these sheets undressed

I'd hold the gun if you asked me to
But if you love me like you say you do
Would you ask me to

Trouble's always gonna find you baby
But so will I
Crying only because I'm happy
Hold me across every state line
I'm never gonna leave you baby
Even if you lose what's left of your mind
'Cause you know I'll be right there beside you
Riding through all these western nights

I haven't spoken to my daddy in a long, long time
I don't want him to worry, always wondering if I'm alright
But the neighborhood keeps getting smaller
All starved out when the money's paper thin
All that's left are your walls and you'll die there
I should have known that there's no getting in

Trouble's always gonna find you baby
But so will I
Crying only because I'm happy
Hold me across every state line
I'm never gonna leave you baby
Even if you lose what's left of your mind
'Cause you know I'll still be right behind you
Riding through all these western nights

Through these western nights
Crying in the light of the TV static
I'll still be alright
Clinging onto you like some love blind addict
I'll be screaming your name
Past the gas stations, trailing down the interstate
Please don't love how I need you
And know that one day, you and I could be ok

"Family Tree"

These crosses all over my body
Remind me of who I used to be
Give myself up to him in offering
Let him make a woman out of me
I'm just a child but I'm not above violence
My mama raised me better than that
When the preacher talks, that man demands his silence
Daddy said shoot first then run and don't look back

So take me down to the river and bathe me clean
Put me on the back of your white horse to ride
All the way to the chapel, let you wash all over me

I've killed before and I'll kill again
Take the noose off, wrap it tight around my hand
They say heaven hath no fury like a woman scorned
And baby, Hell don't scare me, I've been times before

So take me down to the river and bathe me clean
Put me on the back of your white horse to ride
All the way to the chapel, let you wash all over me

These crosses all over my body
Remind me of who I used to be
Let Christ forgive these bones I've been hiding
And the bones I'm about to leave

So take me down to the river and bathe me clean
Put me on the back of your white horse to ride
All the way to the chapel, let you wash all over me

"Hard Times"

Hide me there
Under the leaves
9 going on 18
Lay it on me
Tell me a story
About how it ends
Where you're still the good guy
I'll make pretend
Cause I hate this story
Where happiness ends
And dies with you

I thought good guys get to be happy
I'm not happy
I am poison in the water and unhappy
Little girl who needs her daddy real bad

In the corner
On my birthday
You watched me
Dancing right there in the grass
I was too young
To notice
That some types of love could be bad
Praying I'd be like you
Doing all of the things that you do
And I still do
And that scares me

I'm tired of you, still tied to me
(Bleeding whenever you want)
Too tired to move, too tired to leave
I'm tired of you, still tied to me
(It's just the way that you are)
I'm tired of you, too tired to leave
(I just wanna sleep)
I'm tired of you, still tied to me
(I just wanna sleep)
Too tired to move, too tired to leave
(I just wanna sleep)
I'm tired of you, still tied to me
(Please, can I sleep, can I sleep?)
I'm tired of you, too tired to leave
I'm tired of you, still tied to me
Too tired to move, too tired to leave

"Thoroughfare"

You fell in love with America when you were 12 years old
And by 17 you knew you had to see it all
You loved your dad and the love he had for your mother so
You had to get out and go chasin' it's sweet call

I met you there in Texas somewhere on the thoroughfare
On the side of the road in some torn up clothes with a pistol in my pocket
I didn't trust no one but you said "Baby, don't run, I'll take you anywhere"
So I hopped right in, outta luck to spend, and at least your truck beats walking

And you said "Hey, do you wanna see the west with me?
Cause love's out there and I can't leave it be"
And I said "Honey, love's never meant much to me
But I'll come with you if you're sure it's what you need"

So we made off for California to find your lover, driving day and night
And every small town diner saw our faces at least once or twice
But in these motel rooms, I started to see you differently
Cause for the first time since I was a child, I could see a man who wasn't angry

And he said "It's been a long damn time since I left Florida, no one left to leave, no one left to love
But now that I met you, I finally know just where I'm headin'"
And we found heaven in time where your western sunshine met my deep southern wet
And you got lost in it and yet you found yourself hard pressed for air and sweatin'

And you said "Hey, do you wanna see the west with me?
(Do you wanna see the west with me?)
Cause love's out there and I can't leave it be"
(I can't leave it, I can't leave it)
And I said "Honey, love's never meant that much to me
(Nothing much)
But I'll come with you if you're sure it's what you need"

Once we reached the coast you said "End of the line, we finally hit the edge, after all this time
I didn't find my love but I still made it this far without it"
But then you turned to me and stared into me deep and said "But maybe not, cause look at what I've got
You might not be my love, but, baby, I doubt it"

And you said "Hey, do you wanna see the west with me?
Cause love's out there and I can't leave it be"
And I said "Honey, love's never meant much to me
But I'll come with you if you're sure it's what you need"

Cause in your pickup truck with all of your dumb luck is the only place I think I'd ever wanna be

"Gibson Girl"

You wanna love me right now
You wanna get alone with me
You wanna get my clothes off
And hurt me
You came alone to me
From however far away
Asking me to know how I know
You're all the same

Black leather and dark glasses
Pouring another while I shake my ass
He's cold-blooded so it takes more time to bleed
Obsession with the money, addicted to the drugs
Says he's in love with my body, that's why he's fucking it up
And then he says to me

"Baby, if it feels good
Then it can't be bad"
Where I can be immoral
In a stranger's lap
And if you want it good
Downright iconic
Something they all want
That only you can have

You wanna fuck me right now
You wanna see me on my knees
You wanna rip these clothes off
And hurt me

And if you hate me
Please don't tell me
Just let the lights bleed
All over me

If it feels good
Then it can't be bad
Where I can be immoral
In a stranger's lap
And if you want it good
Downright iconic
Then I would show you something
You can never have

And if it feels good
Then it can't be bad
Where I can be immoral
In a stranger's lap
And if you want it good
Downright iconic
Then I would show you something
You can never have

You wanna love me right now
You wanna love me right now
You wanna fuck me right now
You wanna
You wanna love me right now
You wanna love me right now
You wanna fuck me, fuck me
You wanna love me, love me
You wanna

"Ptolemaea"

I followed you in
I was with you there
I invited you in
Twice, I did
You love blood too much
But not like I do
Not like I do

Heard you, saw you, felt you, gave you
Need you, love you, love you, love you
Heard you, saw you, felt you, gave you
Need you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, saw you, love you, gave you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, saw you, felt you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you

Suffer does the wolf, crawling to thee
Promising a big fire, any fire
Saying I'm the one, he's gonna take me
I'm on fire, I'm on fire, I'm on fire
Suffering is nigh, drawing to me
Calling me the one, I'm the white light
Beautiful, finite

Even the iron still fears the rot
Hiding from something I cannot stop
Walking on shadows, I can't lead him back
Buckled on the floor when night comes along
Daddy's left and Mama won't come home

You poor thing
Sweet, mourning lamb
There's nothing you can do
It's already been done

What fear a man like you brings upon
A woman like me
Please don't look at me
I can see it in your eyes
He keeps looking at me
Tell me, what have you done
Stop, stop, stop, make it stop, stop
Make it stop
Make it stop, I've had enough
Stop, stop, stop, stop

I am the face of love's rage
I am the face of love's rage

Blessed be the Daughters of Cain, bound to suffering eternal through the sins of their fathers committed long before their conception
Blessed be their whore mothers, tired and angry waiting with bated breath in a ferry that will never move again
Blessed be the children, each and every one come to know their god through some senseless act of violence
Blessed be you, girl, promised to me by a man who can only feel hatred and contempt towards you
I am no good nor evil, simply I am, and I have come to take what is mine
I was there in the dark when you spilled your first blood
I am here now as you run from me still
Run then, child
You can't hide from me forever

"Sun Bleached Flies"

Sun bleached flies sitting in the windowsill
Waiting for the day they escape
They talk all about that money and how their babies are always changing while they're breathing in the poison of the pain
What I wouldn't give to be in Church this Sunday
Listening to the choir, so heartfelt, all singing
God loves you, but not enough to save you
So, baby girl, good luck taking care of yourself

So I said fine, 'cause that's how my daddy raised me
If they strike once then you just hit 'em twice as hard
But in the end, if I bend under the weight that they gave me
Then this heart would break and fall as twice as far

We all know how it goes
The more it hurts, the less it shows
But I still feel like they all know, and that's why I can never go back home
And I spend my life watching it go by from the sidelines
And God, I've tried, but I think it's about time I put up a fight

But I don't mind 'cause that's how my daddy raised me (How my daddy raised me)
If they strike once then you just hit 'em twice as hard
But I always knew that in the end no one was coming to save me
So I just prayed and I keep praying and praying and praying

If it's meant to be then it will be
So I met him there and told him I believe
Singing if it's meant to be then it'll be
I forgive it all as it comes back to me (Back to me)
If it's meant to be then it will be
So I met him there and told him I believe (I believe, yeah)
Singing if it's meant to be then it will be (Oh, oh)
I forgive it all as it comes back to me (It comes back to me)
If it's meant to be then it'll be (It'll be, it'll be, it'll be)
So I met him there and told him I believe (Yeah)
Singing if it's meant to be then it will be
I forgive it all as it comes back to me (Oh)

I'm still praying for that house in Nebraska
By the highway, out on the edge of town
Dancing with the windows open
I can't let go when something's broken
It's all I know and it's all I want now

"Strangers"

"God is telling you and I there is death, for all of us
But then we find that the scriptures also tell us that we have a great promise, that there is a better place for those who believe in the lord Jesus Christ"

In your basement, I grow cold
Thinking back to what I was always told
Don't talk to strangers or you might fall in love
Freezer bride, your sweet divine
You devour like smoked bovine hide
How funny, I never considered myself tough

You're so handsome, walking over to me now

I tried to be good
Am I no good?
Am I no good?
Am I no good?
With my memory restricted to a Polaroid in evidence
I just wanted to be yours
Can I be yours?
Can I be yours?
Can I be yours?
If I'm turning in your stomach and I'm making you feel sick

When my mother sees me on the side
Of a milk carton in Winn-Dixie's dairy aisle
She'll cry and wait up for me
We'll make love in your attic all night
Euphoric in some strange delight
I'm happier here cause he told me I should be
You're so handsome when I'm all over your mouth

I tried to be good
Am I no good?
Am I no good?
Am I no good?
With my memory restricted to a Polaroid in evidence
I just wanted to be yours
Can I be yours?
Can I be yours?
Can I be yours?
If I'm turning in your stomach and I'm making you feel sick

Am I making you feel sick?
Am I making you feel?
Am I making you feel sick?
Am I making you feel?
Am I making you feel sick?
Am I making you feel sick?
Am I making you feel sick?
Am I making you feel sick?
Am I?

Found you just to tell you that I made it real far
And that I never blamed you for loving me the way that you did while you were torn apart
I would still wait with you there
Don't think about it too hard
Or you'll never sleep a wink at night again
Don't worry 'bout me and these green eyes
Mama, just know that I love you (I do)
And I'll see you when you get here

"Famous Last Words (An Ode To Eaters)"

My lips are still burnt from kissing your face
And feverish forehead, the blood that you waste
I'm tired of this, watching it wash out of you

I beg you to stay, just 'til tomorrow
I'll clean up the bathtub and we'll leave the state
Mouth open, silent and blue

And in the heat, it searched for you
You were the one I'd have starved with
'Til I can't hold out no more
You were the one I'd come looking for
Over and over and over again

Look at me baby, dead in my eyes
It's the end of our holiday, but it isn't goodbye
Carry me with you all of the time

Eat of me baby, skin to the bone
Body on body, until I'm all gone
But I'm with you, inside

"Powerline Valley"

When I met you there underneath the powerlines, I'd start to cry
To wash you away
Cause I'm a goddamn fool and I knew you'd ruin my life
In the fever dream
Of a summer haze

I was 19
You were 21
My mama said she loved you
She wasn't the only one
You lost yours back
When you were 15
You forgot softness
And what the word means

But I've come to know you like you forgot
You knew yourself

Gave you my virginity under the overpass
Static tearing up your daddy's stereo
You were pouring sweat and I was bleeding out on your seats
But we just laughed to death and held each other close

Valleys of powerlines
We drive by day and night
Stretching for miles away from here
We talk of runnin'
Straight shot just gunnin'
Until we're out there in the clear

It's been hard here for you
But I know, I'm trying too
All alone in this town
In this Alabama wild
Nothing stops if not for you
But I'll always love you and you know I will

We spent September on the backroads
Shotgunnin' warm bud lights down a sinner's rabbit hole
By the fire, taking off my dirty blouse
I let your hands do things that no one needs to know

And I love you like you won't ever know cause you get too caught up in what they tell you to

I'll never forget the night or the paper in his hand when you found your daddy there swinging from the ceiling fan
By that belt you fucking hated
That left the marks I don't ask about
All I know is I've never seen you hurt as bad as you do right now

Now you crush up pills to forget
And you crush up more to sleep
You crushed yourself into a ghost
That I can't reach when you're inside me
And I take each blow you give me
And I keep them as a gift
At least you can still bear to touch me
And when you throw you never miss
It's been hard here for you
But I know, I'm trying too
All alone in this town
In this Alabama wild
Nothing stops if not for you
But I'll always love you and you know I will

You'd been gone for days when I
Heard the news that you'd been found
Shotgun in hand in your daddy's field
Sprayed out all over the ground one last time
I wish we'd have left while we still could
But I'll do what I promised you I would
And let those powerlines take me somewhere

It's been hard here for you
But I know, I'm trying too
All alone in this town
In this Alabama wild
Nothing stops if not for you
But I'll always love you and you know I will

When I met you there underneath the powerlines, I'd start to cry
And then I'd let you in
Cause I'm a goddamn fool and I let you ruin my life
But if I had the chance
I'd do it all again

"Two Children In A Motel"

There's been a stain in the carpet since the day our father took those pills
And nothing's felt real since then
We haven't seen the ocean since two days after we were born
And now you say you wish they'd thrown you in

The red and white stripes above our bed have started tearing
And I'm just waiting for the stars to fall through
They let this town fall down around us like we always thought it would
But we never left, even though we knew

You and I are not in love, we are just the same
Two children in a motel making love in our own grave
And we are not embarrassed, but we're filled with worms and dirt
We were better off dying with her at birth

And I don't care what girls you hurt as long as you come home to me
'Cause I can't be alone for long
You would've died if I didn't hide you when the army came to take you
You can try, but you can't tell me I'm wrong

You're the only one I'll let touch me
'Cause no one makes me feel safe like you do
All these dreams of violation starting to come true
Deep down, I don't wanna say no to you, no to you

You and I are not in love, we are just the same
Two children in a motel, making love in our own grave
We are not embarrassed, but we're filled with worms and dirt
We were better off dying with her at birth
