"Everyone I've Never Met"

People make me nervous
Especially in malls
They sprint by skinny models
That are nearly ten feet tall
Highways make me fidget
There are way too many cars
And I'm sure I'd like the drivers
If we pulled aside to talk

But from my window they are just a bumper and a light
And I can't see their eyes

I get my food delivered
And my books sent to my door
And I don't talk to people anymore

Barstools make me sweaty
When there's someone I don't know
I probably look so stupid
Climbing up there on my own
And the man behind the bar
Is probably lovely with his kids
And I am just the ass who didn't order a drink

I kissed a girl from the internet
And her lips were cold
But I don't talk to people anymore

I get my food delivered
And my books sent to my door
But I don't talk to people anymore

I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met
I miss everyone I've never met

"Grown Up"

I can remember the feeling of being small
Praying to a God I don't believe in to grow tall

Can you remember the evenings of your youth?
Losing track of time, losing count of hours
Losing your balance, and then losing a tooth

Where does it go?
So fast and so slow?
And so, you notice you got old

Where does it go?
Like how spring melts the snow?
One day, you're living on your own

I can remember believing
That my parents were gods
And yes, there's comfort in people
But fear in a faith that's lost

Oh, what a wonderful feeling
To own and operate your life
Oh, what a terrible burden
All my decisions are mine

Where does it go?
So fast and so slow?
And so, you notice you got old

Where does it go?
Like how spring melts the snow?
One day, you're living on your own

"No More Words"

No more words left
I have no more words left
There's no more ways to say it
I tried my best and I'll swear it, but there's no more words

No more words left
I have no more words left
I'll try my best to show it, and I know that you know it, but there's no more words

And my only concern is that if I have used them all
And they still aren't enough, then you'll never know how I loved you
Ooh

No more days left
I have no more days to take care of
Already promised you forever
Fuck marriage, vows, that's better
Now there's no more words

And my only concern is that if I have used them all
And they still aren't enough, then you'll never know how I loved you
Ooh

"Prayer"

Last night I wrote a prayer
To the water in my head
Read the book my mother read

See I don't believe in God
At least not one that's not
As human as me
And anyone, that ever was

See I have to believe
There's some kind of deity
In lonely eyes
In looming trees
I can't count upon
Heaven or hell or law
But I'm scared and lonely
Amen

In history there's faith
When children die people pray
And that's just human nature

It's my instinct to believe
There is something more than me
But I can't name what I can't see

See I have to believe
There's some kind of deity
In broken bones
In skin that bleeds
I can't count upon
Heaven or hell or law
When I'm scared and lonely
Amen

Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen
Amen

"For Now"

My first week back at school
I went to the hospital
Because my spine was inflamed

My family made the drive
At 1 o'clock at night
To bring me home again

A couple of months went by
I would often cry
Told my parents when I stopped avoiding calls

They surprised me then
Said they would drive again
If I needed nothing more than to feel like I was small

So I'll stay for now
''Cause I'm tired out
But there's something 'bout the snow

I guess I'll stay for now
Just 'til I make it out
Until I say that I no longer want to go

I asked my friend last night
If he wouldn't mind
Driving an hour outside of town

He came to pick me up
Didn't make me talk at all
Dropped me off, said goodnight, and turned around

So I'll stay for now
''Cause I'm tired out
But there's something 'bout the snow

I guess I'll stay for now
Just 'til I make it out
Until I say that I no longer wanna go

I don't wanna go
Though I can't see it
I don't wanna go
Repeat 'til I believe it

So I'll stay for now
'Cause I'm tired out
But there's something 'bout the snow

I guess I'll stay for now
Just 'til I make it out
Until I say that I no longer want to go

"Tommy"

Strong as an ox, he was tough as a bull
He had stories and poems and dirty jokes

I came in running with my brother in tow
We had dirt on our knees, climbing on his feet to show him

He hardly spoke and he cheated at poker
If someone got angry, he'd crack a joke

Didn't always go over, but the kids would laugh
Then he'd play in the corner 'till he closed the gap

Oh Tommy I love that one
You used to sing it when you were young
Play it again, my love
For the kids to remember when they grow up

I miss my grandfather, the way that we were
Singing out of time, cause he never finishes words

A house full of instruments, now safely with his kids
And his music in my bones and in my body when I was built

Oh Tommy I love that one
You used to sing it when you were young
Play it again, my love
For the kids to remember when they grow up

Tommy I love that one
You used to sing it when you were young
Play it again, my love
For the kids to remember us

"Understood"

I'll visit my family
To give muscle memory a break
Cause I've been learning since I was a baby
To take on their pain

I'll visit my family
In living rooms that don't get cold
Cause blankets and body heat can't be compared
When it only took you a week to grow old

Love can be understood
I'm sick of attachments I recently learned
I can't relax, and I'm scared of myself
I'm scared for my health
Tell me you'll take me back home

Old friends are precious
But once, all your old friends were new
It takes years of tense shoulders
When growing a person into something that you're used to

I'm sick of the feeling
That nothing will ever stand still
I wish I could stop

Love can be understood
I'm sick of attachments I recently learned
I can't relax, and I'm scared of myself
I'm scared for my health
Tell me you'll take me back home

When I get sad, I go back to my grandmother's house
And picture my mother putting on her wedding dress
Posing beside the same couch
That I am lying on
It helps to remember I took generations to make

Love can be understood
I'm sick of attachments I recently learned
I can't relax, and I'm scared of myself
I'm scared for my health
Tell me you'll take me back home

Love can be understood
I'm sick of attachments I recently learned
I can't relax, and I'm scared of myself
I'm scared for my health
Tell me you'll take me back home

"Coming Back To Me"

I used to wake to the morning
And feel like the world was created for me
I used to wait for the morning so eagerly
Sometimes I just couldn't sleep

It might have started the first time I got really sick
And my mum wasn't there
Three years of college and I had forgotten
How I used to find living rare

But it's all coming back to me now
It's all coming back to me now
It's all coming back to me

Last week I wondered if dying would feel
Like the stories the Catholic Church told
But I used to talk to my mother about how
I just couldn't wait to get old

And it's all coming back to me now
It's all coming back to me now
It's all coming back to me

I used to wake to the morning
And feel like the world was created for me

"5am"

5am in a city that I don't know
Wet hair from swimming in normal clothes
The smell in the air right before it storms
Old feelings with "Pardon me, I'm just stoned"

Lying down in the middle of childhood streets
Not quite recalling falling asleep
The first day of fall 'cause it makes you breathe
The odd time you're tired
But you like how it feels

You like how it feels
You like how it feels
You like how it feels
Like how it feels
You like how it feels
Like how it feels
Like how it feels
How it feels
How it feels

"I Just Don't Think That You Like Me That Much Anymore"

I just don't think that you like me that much anymore
And you'll say you're busy, but it's not the same as before
And no, I'm not angry, I think that I'm just feeling sore
'Cause the truth is that you just don't like me that much anymore

I just don't think that you think about me the same way
And don't lie through your teeth 'cause you know that I know what you'll say
Just leave it unspoken and leave me unsure
You stopped calling first, not that I'm keeping score
And the truth is that you just don't like me that much anymore

And I'm so embarrassed
I'm acting like a little kid
Passive-aggressive and
Practicing little tricks
Watch me, I learned this for you
Look at the things I can do

I just don't think that you like me that much anymore
There's nothing quite wrong and I guess I can't really be sure
But there's sick in my gut, and fine, I'm keeping score
And there's numbers and figures that I can't ignore
And the truth is that you just don't like me that much anymore

The truth is that you just don't like me that much

"To Me"

If you said "speak", then I'd spill
If you said "stop", I'd be still
If you jump, then I jump
Down their throat and I go for the kill

When you say "leave", I run
You said, "Forgive me", I said, "You did nothing wrong"
'Cause when you lie, then I lie
On your back while you sleep to the sound of a gun

And I know that you know what I mean
So at what point of you knowing
Are you just controlling me?
If I'd do anything for you, that means
You know you could do anything to me

You love to watch me dance
Reshaping till you like me again
But the eggshells all break and thin ice always caves
And you just shake your head

You put a picture up
And it didn't feel like love
Just a reminder of contractual debt and luck

And I know that you know what I mean
So at what point of you knowing
Are you just controlling me?
If I'd do anything for you, that means
You know you could do anything

Do you know how humiliating it can be?
To beg for forgiveness that you shouldn't need?
I begged for forgiveness that I didn't need
I begged for forgiveness that I didn't need
I begged for forgiveness that I didn't need
I begged for forgiveness

"Orlando"

Your voice puts sickness into my gut
And I swallowed just a little too much
I don't know what I did wrong
It's not your fault, I just think I was in love

You make every part of me small
I'm short of breath and two feet tall
And I still don't know what I did wrong
It's not your fault, I just think I was in love

What was the day
That you ceased to think of me like that
I don't know what I said
But I'd like the chance to take it back

I have been avoiding you I guess
'Cause when we speak I forget, forget, forget
Then when it hits me, it's further into my chest
You don't want me, forget, forget, forget

Forget, forget, forget

My voice puts sickness into my gut
And I can't believe I missed it once
I guess you did nothing wrong
And I swear it wouldn't have mattered so much

None of this would be worth the fuss if I hadn't been in love
I just think I was in love

"We'll Never Have Sex"

Depollute me, pretty baby
Suck the rot right out of my bloodstream
Oh, dilute me, gentle angel
Water down what I called being grateful

Oh, you kissed me just to kiss me
Not to take me home
It was simple, it was sweetness
It was good to know

You look perfect, you look different
I don't wonder about your indifference
If I said you could never touch me
You'd come over and say I looked lovely

Oh, you kissed me just to kiss me
Not to make me cry
It was simple, you are sweetness
Let's just sit a while

Depollute me, gentle angel
And I'll feel the sickness less and less
Come and kiss me, pretty baby
Like we'll never have sex

"Guts"

I saw you at a party
So I waited in the kitchen for my friends
You wanted to say sorry
But I wanna see your body in a ditch

You held me down and told me
That I thought that you were handsome, but you're wrong
A friend called it a damn shame
'Cause you're really good at playing along

And if I had the guts I would've
Punched you in the backroom
Left you bleeding on the kitchen tiles
While I cleaned up in the bathroom
You thought you were an actor
Claimed a hammered body double
Then you wrote yourself a letter
To my name for all your trouble

I told my friend about you
He was so upset I thought he might've cried
But outside on the pavement
Well it turned to "I like playing with the guy."

And I don't know about my body
It feels like the wrong parts were sent to me
All these feelings I can't name yet
Claimed and touched and played with in my sleep

And if I had the guts I would've
Said "you can't repair it"
Screamed and cried outside the venue
To make sure you were embarrassed
Acted just insane enough
For your friends to claim hysterics
And all the men who couldn't sleep with me
Would testify and swear it

But do their mothers know?
Do their mothers know?

I know it's not really her fault, but I
I do think that she'd cry if I called
I know it's really not her fault, but I
I do think that she'd cry if I called

And if I had the guts I would've
Punched you in the backroom
If I had the guts I would've
Punched you in the backroom

If I had the guts I would've
Punched you in the backroom
Left you bleeding on the kitchen tiles
While I cleaned up in the bathroom
You thought you were an actor
Claimed a hammered body double
Then you wrote yourself a letter
To my name for all your trouble

But does your mother know?
Does your mother know?

"Ask First"

Old, you've made me old
Wise beyond how wise I'd want a body
Cold, so young and cold
I lie to yawn, to cross and dot the note

I imitate, I trace your words
To better fake a better sorry
Sorry soul
But sorry, "Friends, they never scold"

We won't joke around
I won't visit when I'm in town
Listen, from here on
Here on out
I don't write about you now

Mend, you made amends
You've made a man
You make up men
Who break a bone to fix a heart
Paint it nice and call it art

While beauty breaks beneath the blues
You sang for you, I sang for you
And now I'm gone
A full day's drive
And I'm seeing you when you're out of sight

We won't joke around
I won't visit when I'm in town
Listen, from here on
Here on out
I don't write about you now

We won't joke around
I won't visit when I'm in town
Listen, from here on
Here on out
I don't write about you now

"Everything Ends"

Everything ends
From tv shows to parties
Everything ends
Every song and every meal

Everything ends
And that's the saddest thing
I think I'll ever hear

But everything ends
Bad dreams and sorrow
Everything ends
The ache that life has lent

Everything ends
And that's the sweetest thing
I'll ever hear again
That everything ends

"(You) On My Arm"

I wish I'd had a chance to walk with you to parties
You would wear a dress, and I would say "I'm sorry"
For something, don't know what it'd be
But you'd say "Nothing, it's nothing"
And smile at me

I wanna sit around and watch you do your hair
Talk it all into the ground and have a ceremony there
For something, don't know what it'd be
But it'd become nothing, it's nothing
And you'd smile at me

I wanna be, I wanna buy you
Pretty little things and never ever lie to you
Watch you get dressed and compliment your taste
I'd be better armed if you agreed to take it

I wish I'd had a chance to take over the driving
You'd swear to keep me up and fall asleep beside me
And nothing, no terrible dream
Could ever wake us
I don't wanna wake up

And then, one good day when we live in the same city
I'll come by and tell you that you look insanely pretty
Like something, don't know what it'd be
But you'd say nothing, like something
And smile at me

I wanna be, I wanna buy you
Pretty little things and never ever lie to you
Watch you get dressed and compliment your taste 'cause
I'd be better armed if you agreed to take it
I'd be better armed if you agreed to take it
I'd be better armed if you agreed

I wish I'd had a chance to walk with you to parties
Where you would wear a dress and I would say I'm sorry
For something

Oh, I wanna be, I wanna buy you
Pretty little things and never ever lie to you
Watch you get dressed and compliment your taste 'cause
I'd be better armed if you agreed to take it
I wanna be, I wanna buy you
Pretty little things and never ever lie to you
Watch you get dressed and compliment your taste, well
I'd be better armed if you agreed to take it

Oh, I'd be better armed if you agreed to take it
I'd be better armed if you agreed

"To Learn"

What can I say?
I'm learning to lie
But I'm living to learn
What to lie about

I'm losing again
From holding too tight
But I'm living to lose
What I can do without

I've played a few games
Where no score could be fitting
But I'm learning when winning is
Just not worth the sport

And I've been so ashamed
That I've run like the wind
But I'm learning about giving up
And sparing the horse

When I've been cruel
I've taken up self hatred
Procrastinating pains
Of finally seeing myself

But when I looked on the truth
And it bloomed for all its patience
There was ugliness and shame
But there was
Something else

What can I say?
I'm learning to die
But I'm living to learn

"Too Much Time In My House Alone"

At the back of a slingshot
Hoping there's no rot in the wood
Hoping the books I read were good enough for their morals
At the back of a school bus
Knowing I'm late to get home
Not used to being on my own, trying to be normal

But I guess I'm going
Or I'm dying
And I'm finding out

At the end of a bad knot
Hoping there's slack in the rope
Hoping there's somewhere to go through the fog at my feet
Signing off on a letter
As it replaces the wine
Praying it's read just one time and not lost at sea

But I guess I'm going
Or I'm dying
And I'm finding out

I've been looking at myself
And I've been waiting for a reaction
Nothing from the reflection
It's just a kid in circular glasses
Running, running from lightning
Waiting for thunder under her dad's wing
I would, just to be back there
I would do, I would do something

I've been staring at myself
And I've been waiting for an infraction
Something to make me feel better
About being better than I once had been
Running, running from lightning
Waiting inside for something to happen
Missing and never risking rain
For the sake of staying in fashion

"I'd Have To Think About It"

I know that I will love again
I'll meet someone and I'll make amends
I'm sure she'll be a gentleman
And I will be content

I know that I would be fulfilled
See the world and pay my bills
Have a drink and eat my fill
Of dinners and free will

But if you come to me
In my home with my three kids
If you'd asked me to leave
To be with you and split
Well I'd at least have to think about it

You never loved the same amount
You spent a week at my mother's house
And honest, I can tell you now
I'll love you more than my future spouse

And if you come to me
When I've promised to commit
If you told me that you loved me
And asked me for a kiss
Well I'd at least have to think about it

You are my Achille's heel
The weakness only I can feel
I've been a liar and you've been a pill
But I'd still have to think about it

Things just won't be the same
I'm scared to death that I'll scream your name
And still, there's not a thing that I'd change
And that's okay, when I think about it

"Jimmy's Lullaby"

It's getting hard to leave your apartment
The light goes too often and your power is down
It's getting dark and warmth isn't promised
But I'll like you longest when love's not around

I'm gonna come over
And I'm gonna sit there
And I'm gonna hold you
To me when you cry
I'm gonna love better
And I'm gonna listen
And I'm gonna spend winter home by your side

I've spent a life breaking my promises
'Cause the ones that I offered were forced from my hand
I've spent a life practicing caution
And I haven't often changed all my plans

But you just come over
And I'll watch you sit there
And offer to hold me
To you when I cry
I've learned to love better
Since I've seen you listen
And I'm gonna spend winter home by your side

I've spent the year counting my losses
Waiting for slip-ups and scolding my skin
I've spent the year counting my downfalls
Saying I called it and calling it quits

But something is stirring
And something is different
I stood in your kitchen
And I melt down and cry
I think you weep when you find what you're missing
And I'm gonna spend winter home by your side

It's getting hard to leave your apartment
The light goes too often and your power is down
It's getting dark and warmth isn't promised
But I'll love you longest

"Monogamy"

I fall in love
With a different person each week
But I can only do monogamy
Someone tell me what that means

I've been around
But I don't know what I leave behind
Did my lovers all think I was kind?
And when I left, did they know I was lying?

Would you tell me if I was a player but the mouth of God?
Would you tell me if you had to fake it but you loved me honestly?

I want people to think
That I am the love of their lives
When I know they aren't the love of mine
And then I call myself cruel to be kind

I haven't browsed
Through kiosks with gold wedding bands
Since hue bending light held my hand
Silent and walking on Bank

Would you tell me if I was a player but the mouth of God?
Would you tell me if you had to fake it but you loved me honestly?

I fall in love
With a different person each week
But I can only do monogamy
Someone tell me what that means

"music box"

Past the fourth turn by the barn
Where Mrs. Fullman lived 'til she passed on
There is a cottage by the lakeside
Where fairies come out at night

There's a music box in the bedroom
It's playing songs from 1922
And if you listen for long enough
You'll fall asleep and might wake up

Walking in a wonderland
Played in by a marching band
Reaching for a peach
From a shiny purple tree

A butterfly the size of you
Offers to go flying with you
Climb on to her back
And doze off as you relax

Past the light post by the sea
There is a forest with no trees
And there is a garden by the wayside
Where flowers grow over night

There's a music box in the bay
Down on the seabed not so far away
And if you lean in just close enough
You'll be taken by the water and might wake up

Walking in a wonderland
Played in by the singing sand
Waking from a dream
On an underwater beach

A manta ray the brightest blue
Offers to go flying with you
Lay down on her back
And doze off as you relax

Oh the places in your dreams
Are they fiction, or memory?
If you listen for long enough
You'll fall asleep
