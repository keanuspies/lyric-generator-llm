"Hello?"
(feat. Rejjie Snow)

Hello?

Are you into me, like I'm into you?
Do you wanna do the things I wanna do with you
You're so close, and yet so far
I wonder how you look when you're in the dark

You're just one click away, click away, click away
From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake
You're just one click away, click away, click away
From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake

Played you Doom, man, you play Drake
You left crumbs all on my face
Taste like Riri, taste like Bey
Bought you Fenty, took his place
Rolled your weed and kissed your face
Man, wanna smoke you out like all day
Man, wanna do a quickie in the hallway, can
You be all down for the boy, no mass
Hot jump, skip rope, twenty-three years old
Made a hundred grand and went broke, I'm an asshole
Clairo, will you be my real and my fake though
Pesos, cashing out checks when I say so
Frame my life and take my soul
Make me crazy, make me old
Send me roses, text my phone
Fake like rappers, fake like jokes
I know

You're just one click away, click away, click away
From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake
You're just one click away, click away, click away
From something real or fake, real or fake, real or fake

"Flaming Hot Cheetos"

Sometimes I feel like I just wanna go back to my old ways
You're telling me I'm silly
"It's no fun in the old days"
I'm such a romantic
I never remember how things really happened
I guess you're attractive
Or something

"Live in the moment"
That's what they tell me
But what ever happened
To when you would hold me
And hold me
And hold me?

"Girlfriend" or "girl, that's a friend"?
It's easy just to pretend
That we don't have something real

It's just how we feel
We feel
Oh, it's just how we feel
How we feel

I'm feeling something, right?
I'm feeling something, right?
I'm feeling something, right?
I'm feeling something, right?
I'm feeling something, right?
I'm feeling something, right?

I want to be the one you think about at night
And I want to be the one that you would put up a fight for
You know that I adore
That even when you're bored
I'd buy you anything and everything I can't afford

"B.O.M.D."
(feat. Danny L Harle)

Stop, wait a minute
Tell me what you're thinking
Baby, I know you so well
I'll put my heart in it (in it)
Hold me for a minute (minute)
Baby, I would never lie to you (lie to you)

Pull me close, tell me why
Put me in your bed at night
I wanna stay here forever
Pull me close, but don't you lie
Put me in your dreams at night
I shouldn't tell you this

You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
Of my dreams

Somedays I try to call
You never seem to fall for me at all
Baby, why you so cold?
I'm standing at your door
Don't understand why you ignore my love
It is so warm for you

And you're the boy of my dreams
It's not so hard to see why you're the one for me
I love you so dearly
You're the boy of my dreams
It's not so hard to see why you're the one for me
I love you so dearly

You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy of my dreams
You're the boy, you're the boy
You're the boy of my dreams
Of my dreams

"4EVER"

Some things just aren't that simple
You called me wondering why I changed or why I don't look the same
Why I think so differently now?

Is it ever gonna change?
Am I gonna feel this way forever?
Are you gonna be around for me to count on?
Is it ever gonna change?
Am I gonna feel this way forever?
Are you gonna be around for me to count on, count on
On-on-on, on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on

Some things just never seem to fade
I'm thinking about how we were on our first date
You understood the words I was saying
I knew I'd never let you get away
Hold you tight, squeeze you right
Tell you what I want
Put me in your bedroom and I'll sing a little song
Hold you tight, squeeze you right
Give you all I've got
See you in the morning
Over coffee, we'll talk

Is it ever gonna change?
Am I gonna feel this way forever?
Are you gonna be around for me to count on?
Is it ever gonna change?
Am I gonna feel this way forever?
Are you gonna be around for me to count on, count on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on
On-on-on, on-on-on-on

"Pretty Girl"

Polaroid of you dancing in my room
I want to remember
I think it was about noon
It's getting harder to understand, to understand
How you felt in my hands (in my hands)

I could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
And I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you want me to
I could be a pretty girl
Won't ever make you blue
I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in you

I was so blinded by you, now I cry
Just thinking bout the fool that I was
I was such a fool!
I'm alone now but itâs better for me
I don't need all your negativity

I could be a pretty girl
I'll wear a skirt for you
And I could be a pretty girl
Shut up when you want me to
I could be a pretty girl
I'll never make you blue
I could be a pretty girl
I'll lose myself in you

"How (Demo)"

How did I try to get you off my mind?
How did I try to get you off my mind?
Could this be the end?
Of you and I for now
Hope that I see you soon
Don't know what I would do

My heart is under the weather
I know that I'm the only one who can heal it
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I try to beat the struggle for you
That's just too hard for anyone to do

"Alewife"

In Massachusetts, only 30 minutes from Alewife
I lay in my room
Wonderin' why I've got this life
I met you by surprise
You were hangin' out all the time
But you know you saved me from doin'
Something to myself that night

You called me seven times
One, two, three, four, on the line
I didn't mean to scare you
Just had the thoughts in my mind
They showed up to my door
My parents didn't know what for
Swear I could've done it
If you weren't there when I hit the floor

It's been so long
And you've been my sister all along
But you know I'll be alright
Eighth grade was never that tight

"Impossible"

How are you feeling?
How are you doing?
I'm sorry, I just wanted to hear your voice, so clear
What are you thinking?
Am I a nuisance?
It's so strange to talk after all these years

What does it mean, and
It's so confusing
All my old feelings coming back to me
When was the last time
I saw your face?
Know it like the back of my hand, I'd say
And you know I'm not dumb anymore
I picked up the books you threw to the floor
Put them back on the shelf
Don't you see how much I want your help?

And I know we're not the same as we were
Used to be falling hard, but now it just hurts
Me so bad
And you know that I can't hold back
All of these worries that I've had
'Bout you

And I know
That it's time
To forget how I'm feeling, don't want to give in
But I know
Know that it's right
To listen to my breathing and start believing myself
And I know
That it's time
To forget how I'm feeling, don't want to give in
But I know
Know that it's right
To listen to my breathing and start believing myself

Woah, myself
Myself

And I know we're not the same as we were
Used to be falling hard, but now it just hurts
Me so bad
And you know that I can't hold back
All these worries that I've had
'Bout you

"Closer To You"

I feel it in my bones
Even when I'm alone
Momma said, "I told you so"
Going down a different road
You call me late at night
I pick up every time
Wish that I could rewind
Get some peace of mind

Shut up, don't wanna hear it now I'm fed up
Wish I could say it was enough
To make me walk away
And I'm messed up
'Cause every time I start to get up
And now my head feels fucked up
And I know it won't change

The things you do
Only make me want to get closer to you
And the things that you say
Only make me want to stay

Can't push me away
I'm not going, I'll wait
You know this street runs two ways

So, I need to hear your voice
Know I'm standing here by choice
And I can't hear the background noise, anyway

Shut up don't wanna hear it now I'm fed up
Wish I could say it was enough to make me walk away
And I'm messed up, 'cause every time I start to get up
And now my head feels fucked up
And I know it won't change

The things you do
Only make me want to get closer to you
And the things that you say
Only make me want to stay

"North"

I'm nervous, couldn't tell you why
Touching me, hands warm on my thighs
And I know I could turn a blind eye
Afraid of what I'm gonna find
Does it really have to be this way?
Oh, when my body hasn't felt the same?
Since you left my apartment
Think I'm used to how you ascend

I just want to let you know
I'm seeing sides that you don't show
And I know that we got some potential
'Cause that love you gave me was so gentle

Do you think that you could stay?
I need more time, I need to get away from you
For my lover
Spinning all on the ground
Is it all I have? What are you saying?
Usually I'd be fine, but my head is spinning
I never let anybody in
Somehow you got under my skin

Never seen a face like yours
I got it together but my breath feels short
I don't wanna close the door
Maybe I should just go up north

All I'm tryna say
Is I miss you in every way
Fingertips on my back
Things I know that I can't have

Never seen a face like yours
I got it together but my breath feels short
I don't wanna close the door
Maybe I should just go up north

Maybe I should just go up north
Maybe I should just go up north

"Bags"

Every second counts
I don't want to talk to you anymore
All these little games
You can call me by the name I gave you
Yesterday

Every minute counts
I don't want to watch TV anymore
Can you figure me out?
Just doin' this to waste more time on the couch

Can you see me I'm waiting for the right time
I can't read you but if you want, the pleasure's all mine
Can you see me using everything to hold back
I guess this could be worse
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags

Pour your glass of wine
Mitchell told me I should be just fine
Cases under the bed
Spill it open let it rush to my head

I don't want to be forward
I don't want to cut corners
Savor this with everything I have inside me
I'm not the type to run
I know that we're having fun
But what's the rush?
Kissing and my cheeks are so flushed

Tell you how I felt
Sugar coated melting in your mouth
Pardon my emotions
I should probably keep it all to myself
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me
Know you'd make fun of me

Can you see me I'm waiting for the right time
I can't read you but if you want, the pleasure's all mine
Can you see me using everything to hold back
I guess this could be worse
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags
Walking out the door with your bags

"Softly"

Is it alright
To feel this way so early?
But am I blind?
All the sweet nothings
Falling in love over night

Didn't mean to get so close
And I know that I should probably go
But I got this feeling
Tell me girl I gotta know

Touch you softly I call you up late at night
Know that it isn't right
But you can be my one and only
You get me in the mood
Know what I'm trying to do
Do you think that we could move
Closer baby I want you

And all my life
Been wanting this forever
And in my mind
Think of ways to ask you
Why don't you come over sometime?

Didn't mean to get so close
And I know that I should probably go
But I got this feeling
Tell me girl I got to know

Touch you softly I call you up late at night
Know that it isn't right
But you can be my one and only
You get me in the mood
Know what I'm trying to do
Do you think that we could move
Closer baby I want you, yeah

And I don't care what they say
And I don't care what they say
Care what they say to me
I'm doing it differently
Baby, I'm doing it differently

"Sofia"

I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say, you're mine
Sofia know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say, you're mine
Sofia know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

You know
I'll do anything you ask me to
But oh my god
I think I'm in love with you

Standing here alone now
Think that we can drive around
I just want to say
How I love you with your hair down
Baby you don't got to fight
I'll be here til the end of time
Wishing that you were mine
Pull you in, it's alright

I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say, you're mine
Sofia know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

Honey, I don't want it to fade
There's things that I know could get in the way
But, I don't want to say goodbye
And I think that we could do it if we tried

I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say, you're mine
Sofia know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

I think we could do it if we tried
I think we could do it if we tried

Sofia know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime
Sofia know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

"White Flag"

Piece it all
Back together again
Didn't get along
Been four years since
We had it all
And you were my friend
Those days got away
Hope you find solace in this

I was 15 when
I first felt loneliness
Cut my hair
Only listened to Elvis

Grown apart and we're so far gone
But waving the white flag
Sending my love back, move on

Laughing at me
You kick me when I'm down
Oh, how can you pretend
You didn't say that now?
Wish you the best
I know that you're stressed out
But you know in small towns
What goes around comes back around

"Feel Something"

Travelled so far on my own
I don't know where I've gone
And I don't wanna be alone
When I am so far from my home

You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to
Get over you

Wanna go back to the place where we started
At the party, I see you, but you keep your guard up
We could be something special if you wanted
I'm afraid that if we tried to
You would just give up (You would just give up)

You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to get over you
You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to get over you

Do you wanna go away with me?
Do you wanna go away with me?
Do you wanna go away with me?
Do you wanna go away with me?

You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to get over you
You wanna feel something
But I don't feel nothing
Trying so hard to get over you

"Sinking"

Every night
Think of things I can't do or haven't done
It doesn't make me weak, sometimes I feel like I can't breathe
Is that all you see in me?

Don't you wait for something or
Else you'll be sinking to the floor
No, you can't help no more
Is it my doing? Is it my doing? (Mm)

It starts getting colder
Why doe sit feel like I'm older than I ask to be?
But when you say my name
It all falls away to tenderly

Don't you wait for something or
Else you'll be sinking to the floor
Oh, you tried to help me
Why do I feel so cold?
Is it my doing? Is it my doing?

(Ooh)
Is it my doing? Is it my doing?
(Ooh)
Is it my doing?
(Ooh)
Mm-mm
Is it my doing?
(Ooh)
Mm-mm

"I Wouldn't Ask You"

I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me (I think I'm losing you)

Sores appear 'round my neck, don't get close to me
Ask about your life, still in the nose-bleeds?
Laying in your bed, call it intimacy
Wish I could get past the security
Wonder why I wake up living in a made-up
Dream of you and I, together there
Baby, wake the fuck up
Time for you to grow up
Don't you know that life is rarely ever fair?

I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, and I wouldn't ask you to take care of me

Tell you how I feel, I keep it real clean
Lock hanging 'round my neck, you don't get a key
Come a little closer, I'll show you what I mean
Oh, boy, no, it's all for me
Ice cold, baby, I'm ice cold
You're the only one who could make me thaw
Ice cold, baby, I'm ice cold
You're the only one who could make me thaw

I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
I wouldn't ask you to take care of me
Oh, I wouldn't ask you to take care of me

I wouldn't ask you, baby
I wouldn't ask you, baby
To be the one I love
To be the one I love, I love
We could be
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
Caught me by surprise
Everything I need in my life
I wanna call you mine
I wanna be intertwined
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
We could be so strong
We'll be alright, we'll be alright
Feels like I've known you for so long
Without you, I don't feel strong
Feels like I've known you for so long
Without you, I don't feel so strong
So strong
We could be so strong

"Bambi"

I'm stepping inside a universe
Designed against my own beliefs
They're toying with me and tapping their feet
The work's laid out, cut out to the seams

It's not that I crave
Any more company
I'd like to say, say a few things
Clearing your throat while I count to three
Keep hold of my hand
We both know I can leave

I don't like to cry, before I know why
But honestly, I might
You pick a new fight, wiping tears from the night
Blue ribbon ties while emotions are high

I told all my friends
They were glad to see
Sat in a circle, in front of my Claud's tapestry
In a dorm less than three
Minutes to drive
We both can always

Take it or leave it
The moments here
And you should believe it
Know that you should

I pull until I'm left with the burns
Blisters and the dirt left in-between my fingers
Rushing so I can beat the line
But what if all I want is conversation and time?
I move so I don't have to think twice
I drift and float through counties with my one sided climb

Once, I oughta make a choice to move forward
I'll take, I'll take a picture for your locker

"Amoeba"

Between the gaps I was swimming laps
Got close to some epiphany
I'll convince a friend to join deep ends
Have your toes touch the lack of cement

Gather to one corner of the woods
Echo chambers inside a neighborhood
And centerfold, humility shown
You're not as good as what your mama's sewn

Aren't you glad that you reside
In a hell and in disguise?
Nobody yet everything
A pool to shed your memory

Could you say you even tried?
You haven't called your family twice
I can hope tonight goes differently
But I show up to the party just to leave

Between the gaps, keep it under wraps
How I got to some epiphany
I'll convince myself when it turns to twelve
The photos keep the sentiment

Gather to one corner of the woods
Echo chambers inside a neighborhood
And centerfold, humility shown
You're not as good as what your mama's sewn

Aren't you glad that you reside
In a hell and in disguise?
Nobody yet everything
A pool to shed your memory

Could you say you even tried?
You haven't called your family twice
I can hope tonight goes differently
But I show up to the party just to leave

Pulling back I tried to find
The point of wasting precious time
I sip and toast to normalcy
A fool's way into jealousy

I mock and imitate goodbyes
When I know that I can't deny
That I'll be here forever while
I show up to the party just to leave

"Partridge"

You move in your ways without a law
And I'll force you to feel the weight I'm standing on
But the perfect harmony is lost
As I watch you fall awake and ask, "What's wrong?
Did I really miss all the work you've done?"
(All the work I've done)

Calling someone else is only harder
I'll explain myself again
Take the chance on someone's daughter
She makes me feel like I'm the best

The only time I see you smile
Is after hours or the finish line
But bring yourself to the edge
Of the cliff
And look upon
The animals who wake before us at dawn
(All the work they've done)

Comfortable, unmotivated always
Seeking other stories other memories
I'm sorry I have to hold you longer than you expected
It's only temporary

I'll let you walk and make your own discovery
That one of these days, I know that you might come back to me

"Zinnias"

See me standing on the corner of Comstock
And Waverly in a daze
Where I saw my brother speak for the first time since he graduated in the Spring
Got a cold piece of information to bring to you
Said, "Sorry but I can't stay here while we wait for June"
I miss the southern Cosmos and the Zinnias
Oh, the Zinnias
It comes to me in a dream, in the dead heat and the suffocating
Wet grip that's got a hold on my mama
It's Marietta's kiss

Quietly, I'm tempted
Sure sounds nice to settle down for a while
Let the real estate show itself to me
I could wake up with a baby in a sling
Just a couple doors down from Abigail
My sister, man, and her ring

Quietly, I'm tempted
Sure sounds nice to settle down for a while
Let the real estate show itself to me
I could wake up with a baby in a sling
Just a couple doors down from Abigail
My sister, man, and her ring

"Blouse"

Here we are
Quiet at your kitchen table
With courtesy to little pet peeves
Napkins on laps strands pulled back
I hang the scarf and my mom's anorak

Why do I tell you how I feel?
When you're just looking down the blouse
It's something I wouldn't say out loud
If touch could make them hear
Then touch me now
If touch could make them hear
Then touch me now

Talking to
Some who laugh and others scorned
I guess humour could help me after all
It's funny now I'm just useless and a whore
But I get a co-sign from your favourite one-man show

Why do I tell you how I feel?
When you're too busy looking down my blouse
It's something I wouldn't say out loud
If touch could make them hear
Then touch me now
If touch could make them hear
Then touch me now
If touch could make them hear
Then touch me now

"Wade"

Holding out all my fears and faults
Those that conquer me
Started the second pack
Before the first ones finishing

I like to bridge the gap between
A break and long lost lovers
Only to get me by until I decide
I've had enough

Most of the time
I can feel them on me
The eyes from the stranger's window
It's dark and It's lonely
But it's nothing to me
At least somebody's home

Decades are wasting
On your name
You'll grasp the concept of life
When you give up the point of trying
If you don't do the things you do
They'll just happen to you

Pulling out all my weight
And do my part and you'll say
"Oh I'm so glad you're here with us today
You probably thought you would be gone"
And until there's another way
I just have to face
That there's no real place
To go where I really could be alone

I'd promise you now, that if I had known
I wouldn't be standing here
There's memories to be made
And water that's to wade
I used it all up drying tears

Of course I don't regret
The moments where I wept
And yearned for what I've got now
It's only time
It won't age like wine
But It's mine, and I'll take the blow

"Harbor"

Okay, I'm finished now
And I kept my faith for long enough
And I hope I'm old and fairly sober
If I'm let down

Maybe you keep me around
For the constant affirmations
While I scrounge for understanding
And fall out

I'll let you win and I'll let you tie
The ribbon to my hair
Just so that we could come back to this if we really cared
The morning gates stay open
If you had a thought that I'd be there
(Oh, I'd be there)

Know we could use a break
Because I can't feel my feet
I carried you all the way upstairs
So you can sleep and I can think

Stand guard
When I am near
Clinging on to everything you fear
Keeping me close
While you hold me out and say
I don't love you that way

Harbor myself away from everyone else
I'm half awake and intimate
Eyes closed and I'll commit
What I wish I had with you
I'll pretend until it's true
I don't love you that way

Swallow the pill, it's only fair that I hear
Know myself better than I have in years
I don't know why I have to defend what I feel
I try

Stand your guard
When I am near
Loathe me until
You're reminded of the deal
One of us knows
When you hold me out and say
You don't love me that way

"Just For Today"

Honestly, I didn't think I'd end up here this time
Or anywhere at all, I'm distant just enough to never fall behind
Picturing the saddest scene of wearing bedsheets
And two pats on the back, "It just takes time"
It's getting late, since when did taking time take all my life?

Mommy
I'm afraid I've been talking to the hotline again
It's stirring
But the ripples always seek out the ones who carry me

I blocked out the month of February for support
At least I have this year, I won't be worrying anyone on tour
As we speak, I'm here to meet devils for tea
Peering 'round the corner of my life
I throw my drink into the faces of my demise

At thirty
Your honey's gonna ask you, "What the hell is wrong with me?"
And finally
An answer from your throat comes crawling and you can proceed

"Reaper"

It's nice to hear your voice again
I pushed you so far down and I let you sink through the drain
There's a claw on my shoulder
And she's saying the obvious
"You know eventually you're gonna have to be a provider, too"

She's coming closer, I can feel her breathe
I keep forgetting that I'll have a family
If I listen in, with my hands cupped and on my knees
I can hear the single obnoxious sigh of relief

I'm born to be somebody then somebody comes from me
I'll tell you about the Rabbit Moon and when to keep walking
I'll spare you pain, I can feel my shame come through that door
I can't fuck it up if it's not there at all

I'm born to be somebody then somebody comes from me
I'll show you where I did swim team and drive to Dunwoody
I'll spare you pain, I can feel my shame creep through that floor
I can't fuck it up if it's not there at all
I can't fuck it up if it's not there at all

"Little Changes"

I see the fog as a clean slate
There's room for us
There's room for anything

The usual urge I'd see clear
A flower for you and the dogs are near

But white light comes from nothing at all
For the first time it feels
Good
Good to fall between
The ones I love and the ones that faded
He loved me good enough to calm me down
But tried to trick me into little changes

I see the end before it begins
No use to work, no use in anything
A crack in the sky
The heaven's hand
A cloud just for you and a place to land

But white noise comes from nothing at all
And finally I feel
Good
Good to fall between
The ones I love and the ones that faded
He loved me good enough to calm me down
But tried to trick me into little changes

"Management"

Mom, would you give me a ring?
One for the ride and one for the magazines?
She's only twenty-two

A flash to the upbringing
Of the child, the canine
What will become mine
Once I decide to leave?

Seek to take and give it all away
Once you know it's only a maze
There could be more days like today

Complain to the management
About my lack of self respect
Fast forward to when I have friends
And men who don't interject
Harping over old regrets
Hating how I let it get
To me

Only for a short while
I'm bound to lose my head
And just when I start to think it's ended
Another demand commences
I'm doing it for my future self
The one who needs more attention
I'll forget to forgive and hold it all in
I'm old with some resentment

"2 Hold U"

Is it a crime that I'm just trying to hold you?
To hold you
Interlocking fingers and I'm ready, I told you
I told you
If I'm in love then why is my heart hurting?
Hurting

Everywhere that I go
I just see you (I see you)
I wrote it down
I told my mom
My friends all know
We get along
I want you
To want me too

I want to kiss you
I want to love you
I want to touch you
I think too much

You

"Bubble Gum"

Sorry I didn't kiss you
But it's obvious I wanted to
Bubble gum down my throat and it's a curse
But my luck couldn't get any worse

'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these seven years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grin

You look so nice in your shirt
It's sad because it just hurts
I'd do anything for you
But would you do that for me, too?

'Cause I swallowed the bubble gum
Oh, and these 7 years will be pretty dumb
Pink flowers grow from my skin
Pepto bismol veins and I grin

"Duet"

You've got nice eyes
They're very blue
That is why I look at you
I look at you
I look at you
I look at you
I look at you
I look at you

Making a list
Of people to kiss
The list is a million you's long
Just you's all the way down

Olive oil soft
And laundry warm
I know I like you
I just don't know what for

With my boy Ronnie
Listening to Connie
I couldn't stop if I tried
I will love you til I die

Oh

"Favoritism"

I was in love for the second time
She told me not to lie
You said, honey, I can sense that you're
Struggling to find out what happened to you
On tour and alone with nothing to lose
Cried myself to sleep that night
I haven't wrapped my head around it
Maybe I should think about
Your hands on my sides, my shirt lost to wine

When I turned around and said
"I can't believe you like me"
When I turned around and said
"I can't believe you like me better than the rest"
When I turned around and said
"I can't believe you like me better than the rest"

Turns out kissing someone older
Doesn't mean there's gonna be a lesson attached
Say, I'm mature for my age
But there's a bed to be made, why don't you lie in it?
Swear I'll take this one to my grave
And nothing's gonna change
Oh man, it is the same
There's a child writing stories of when they become king
And learn to take everything

When I turned around and said
"I can't believe you like me better than the rest"
When I turned around and said
"I can't believe you like me better than the rest"
Oh, better than the rest

"For Now"

Pull the rug from underneath me now
Caught up in the landslide
Blindside on the ground
Would it make a difference if I'd looked at all?
Loving you is simple, sweet
And I'm bound to fall

'Cause I'm loving you for now
Loving you for now
I'm loving you for now
Until it all breaks down

Pull the cloth from over my eyes tonight
Let me see what I fear
What's it symbolize?
Would it make a difference if I learned at all?
Loving you is freeing me
Oil in your palm

'Cause I'm loving you for now
I'm loving you for now
'Cause I'm loving you for now
Until it all breaks down

"Get With U"

Sometimes I'm just alone
Sometimes I'm just sitting at home
Sometimes I'm just alone
Sometimes I'm just sitting at home

Get high with me
On the corner of Main Street
Get high with me
Get high with me
On the corner of Main Street
Get high with me

Sometimes I'm just alone
Sometimes I'm just sitting at home
Sometimes I'm just alone
Sometimes I'm just sitting at home

Get high with me
On the corner of Main Street
Get high with me
Get high with me
On the corner of Main Street
Get high with me

All I want to do
And all I want to do
And all I want to do
Is get with you

All I want to do
And all I want to do
And all I want to do
Is get with you

Is get with you
Is get with you
Is get with you

"Heaven"
(from "Skate Kitchen" soundtrack)

Alone, for the last time
You're just a loner
Give it a try

And you're hard on yourself
And your laugh, it just melts in my hands
Lonesome in the streets
You say the mice all seem to laugh at me

I'll get by with you on my mind
I'll get by with you on my side
I'll get by with you on my mind
I'll get by with you on my side

I'm not at home
And I'll just say that
Being with you makes me feel less old

A kid on the street playing basketball
Horses will run forever, can't be called

I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
Wish that I, wish that I
Wish that I could go back in time

I'll get by with you on my mind (on my mind)
I'll get by with you on my side (on my side)
I'll get by with you on my mind (on my mind)
I'll get by with you on my side

"I Don't Think I Can Do This Again"

Remember when we used to fight
I'd stay up all night
Trying to put it behind me

But was it really that long ago
Realize that I should let it go
Don't even know the time and the place

Call me when you get a second
Know it's been a minute since I've picked you up
We drove around so I opened the windows down

Don't ask any questions
Only have been here for three seconds
The party's ending, where's your friend?

But I don't think I can do this again
I don't think I can do this again
I don't think I can do this again

But I don't think I can do this again
(Do this again) I don't think I can do this again

The grass is always green
But why did it used to feel
So much softer, longer, sweeter, cleaner than this

And I'm all in my head now
Don't you see what you've done now?
Missing all the things, I wouldn't of loved

Call me when you get a second
Know it's been a while since we talked it out
We're missing, I'm so young and we're so full of doubt

And I've been thinking
Of you, in love, you

Do you remember it too?
Remember it too
Remember it too

I don't think I can do this again
(Do this again) I don't think I can do this again
(Do this again) I don't think I can do this again
(Do this again) Remember it too

I don't think I can do this again

"Lavender"

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

When I'm with you I'll be
When I'm with you I'll be alright
When I'm with you I'll
When I'm with you I'll be alright

Once in a while
I start to fall in love again
Only been some time, and so
I don't know why I can't let you go

'Til the break of day
'Til the night I sleep
No one beats you, baby
No one takes your place from me

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

"Sis"

Feelings are so fragile
Egos are always wants

Ship in a bottle collapses on to myself oh
Your soft skin unbroken sin next to my rough calluses
Mild kiss, sleep paralysis
Tell me more about your sister

Brittle bones hold my body together
Tender touches mend me with feathers oh

Guess I know
Guess I know
Guess I know

Oh
