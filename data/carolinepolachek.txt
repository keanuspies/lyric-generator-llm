"Dominic"

Oh, let them talk while we lie in the grass
It flatters the world even if it won't last
Forgive me if I was too forward too fast
But not being yours would be wasteful

Oh, Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after
Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

Oh, let them talk while you reach for my hand
Replacing a drowning idea of a man
And when we get home with our shoes filled with sand
We'll just sleep and forget that we're strangers

Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after
Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

And when you step out that door
You'll leave me unafraid of change
And I...
And when you step out that door
You'll leave me unafraid of change

Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

"Dominic (French Version)"

Oh, laisse les parler pendant que l'on dort sur le sable
Cela flatte le monde, mÃªme si Ã§a ne durera pas
Or pardonne moi de m'Ãªtre emportÃ©e si vite
Ce serait un gÃ¢chis de ne pas Ãªtre Ã  toi

Dominique, toi et moi
C'est un exquis dÃ©sastre
Nos chemins se sÃ©parent Ã  l'aube du lendemain
Dominique, toi et moi
C'est un exquis dÃ©sastre
Nos chemins se sÃ©parent Ã  l'aube du lendemain

Oh, laisse les parler alors que tu prends ma main
Estompant le souvenir de l'empreinte de quelqu'un
Et quand nous rentrons, les cheveux salÃ©s par l'air marin
On s'endort et oublie qu'on se connait presque pas

Dominique, toi et moi
C'est un exquis dÃ©sastre
Nos chemins se sÃ©parent Ã  l'aube du lendemain
Dominique, toi et moi
C'est un exquis dÃ©sastre
Nos chemins se sÃ©parent Ã  l'aube du lendemain

Emporte cette partie de moi
Dans laquelle je me reconnais pas

Emporte cette partie de moi
Dans laquelle je me reconnais pas
Dominique
(Toi et moi, c'est un exquis dÃ©sastre)
Dominique
(Toi et moi, [?])

"Arcadia"

Cars they were passing
Waves they were crashing on the shore
Fingers were burning the pages they're turning
And I want more
Here I ran from the west
Unto ruins where the sun dances with death

Arcadia, Arcadia
Now she holds me tight like I held you
Arcadia, Arcadia
Hour after hour golden blue

To be had...

Arcadia, Arcadia
Now I know that time forgets us too
Arcadia, Arcadia
Hour after hour golden blue

"Backwards And Upwards"

Love
What a mean
Poison arrow welcome to me
What a shot
When I
Bent over to tie shoe laces
Cut it out
At the seed
And the rip is a rotation
Drawing O
In the sky
With no answers in the jury

Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Backwards and up, up, up up

Take the wheel

Oh, the driver is fine
But the passenger is carsick
Back it up
Turn around
Like a ferris wheel I shift it
"Oh, it burns
But it cleans"
Say the nurses in their tunics
"Just admit
You were wrong
It's the opposite of foolish"

Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and upwards
Uh huh, backwards and up, up, up up

Backwards
Backwards
Uh huh, backwards, backwards
Words, words, words

"Getaway Ride"

Pass the screwdriver
(Cha cha cha)
Here's a key
To the courtyard
By the cemetery
(Cha cha cha)
When the world is watching
I'll take the easy way out
To wait until your signal
While you burn the place down

I'll pick you up from where you hide
In uniform with tie untied
No talking baby just the slamming of the doors
Of our getaway ride

So what
(what now)
Of this
(this is)
Desire
(Cha cha cha)
I'm a thief
(Blind thief)
In the schoolyard
(baby)
Or just wanting to be
(Cha cha cha)
Breaking single file
Tell me you want to escape
Down the road to nowhere
To watch my heart break

I'll pick you up from where you hide
In uniform with tie untied
No talking baby just the slamming of the doors
Of our getaway ride

So what?
And so what?

Ride! We can make it
Oh, I've all but lost my mind
Take the rest of me
Take it all
You're my destiny
Ooh
Baby don't be ashamed

Ride...
Ride...

"Avenues"

Between the buoy of dreaming
And the anchor of home
I had you
Leaning into the beams
In the fading heat
I showed you yours, you showed me mine

All my avenues are green
No trembling or goodbye
But the shadows know I miss you
Dearly, dearly
So sincerely

Under buoys of dreams
Above an anchor home
I found you
And though you can't call me lover
I'm a star in your sky
Baby, I'm a loner by design

All my avenues are green
As heartache is unwise
Ashes scatter of what happened
Nearly, nearly
So sincerely

"Lady's Got Gills"

Why is your pretty friend wearing her collar high
Why does she turn away when you look at her in the eye?
It gives me the chills
It's like you to want the one
The one that you couldn't keep
Watch how she holds her breath
And leaves when you go to sleep

The lady's got gills
There's nothing you can do about it, yeah
The lady's got gills
There's nothing you can do about it, yeah

You'd give everything you have
If she'd just promise to come back
From her unexplained trips to the harbor
Where the tide runs black
There's no sense in trading places
To lock her up and keep her in the bath
Or learn how to hold her breath

The lady's got gills
There's nothing you can do about it, yeah
The lady's got gills
There's nothing you can do about it, yeah

Watching from the shore
No, you don't want to lose her
To the roar insatiable
Would you rather drown than say goodbye?

"Dominic"

Oh, let them talk while we lie in the grass
It flatters the world even if it won't last
Forgive me if I was too forward too fast
But not being yours would be wasteful

Oh, Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after
Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

Oh, let them talk while you reach for my hand
Replacing a drowning idea of a man
And when we get home with our shoes filled with sand
We'll just sleep and forget that we're strangers

Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after
Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

And when you step out that door
You'll leave me unafraid of change
And I...
And when you step out that door
You'll leave me unafraid of change

Dominic
You and me are a perfect disaster
Going our separate ways
In the pale morning after

"Reprise"

Cold, unworthy, fickle heart
That's all too late in learning
That if I should love you till the last
I'll leave you be

"Izzit True What They Tell Me"

The second you offered me a ride
I couldn't get the thought out of my mind
Promises open when they're pried
Up with the vapor of a week of sighs
The cards say, "A change is coming near
And as a nestling on the bough
The fool is the martyr of the now"

Izzit true what they tell me?
Izzit true what they tell me?
Izzit true what they tell me?
Izzit true what they tell me?

Inviting you in a second time
How your possessions were lighter than mine
And how we talked all through the night
As if I'd have known you all of my life
Touching your finger to my eye
How you prove the card was right
That said you'd be all I have in sight

Izzit true what they tell me?
Izzit true what they tell me?
Izzit true what they tell me?
Izzit true what they tell me?

Ay, is the lesson cast asunder
Oh, and you can't even know
What kind of lack that you're leaving
Ay, want a rented bed of sorrow
Go to hell I adore you
Ay, ever-righteous call of thunder
Oh, I don't know what to call it
But I know that you feel it
Ay, ever-wretched call of wonder
With no regrets...
Now I receive you on the day
I hide and seek you on the hour
(In time)
In odysseys of no and yes
Even now, as a witness...
And even now...

Am I a finch, am I the cage
O either way I couldn't care
If you could see inside my head
Where every clock is stopped by you
Like in some silent threat
Like I'm the one that should be careful
Though it never could've happened without you
No it never could have happened without you...

Budding interrupted
In glory of their matching
Winding up the rope
Together and alone
Tell me a story
Leaving out the ending
I don't want to know
Whose heart was made to roam

Izzit true what they tell me?
Izzit true what they tell me?
Izzit true what they tell me?
Izzit true what they tell me?

"Wings Of The Parapets"

The wings of the parapets
Watch over the stage of joy and rage
They watch as I catch flight
And you fill the fuel to give me a ride

Here above the open ledge
With no control of which to speak
Oh, if love is a dependency
Resign me

Hear, a dove in the cargo bay
An-hundred miles beneath his feet
Oh, if love is the opposite of free
Resign me

"The Gate"

Standing at the gate
I come here every day
Just to see your face
Just to hear you say
"There's no need to wait
We will be okay"
'Cause finally there's a way
To be both free and safe

"Pang"

There's a look in your eyes when you're hungry for me
It's a beautiful knife cutting right where the fear should be

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me

Tell me what you're afraid of
Tell me what night is made of
What can I not destroy for you?
Color the night electric
Get in me like a secret
I open the door and you run through

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me

Color the night electric
Get in me like a secret
I open the door and you run through

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me

(Tell me what you're afraid of)
There's a look in your eyes when you're hungry for me
(Tell me what you're afraid of)
It's a beautiful knife cutting right where the fear should be

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me

Color the night electric
Get in me like a secret
I open the door and you run through

Into me
Pang, and I go
Into you
Pang, and you go
Into me

Into you (Pang)
Into me (Pang)
Into you (Pang)
Into me (Pang)
Oh, woah, oh
Into me (Pang)
Into you (Pang)

"New Normal"

Now, what is this?
Feeling I know you from long ago
From deep in my past
I don't know why
Why I trust you completely
Don't question it
The bottle is empty

Now, what is this?
Club closing early
The fog machines
And lasers swirling
It's Halloween
I'm sorry for screaming
But I'm afraid
I scare you completely

Now, what is this?
Blizzard in April
I'm underdressed as usual
And you're cheating death
Buying time through the winter
It's house arrest
No stopping for dinner

Now, what is this?
Microphone working
Can't hear myself
The cameras are rolling
And there's the cue
My heart, it beats so hard
I look for you, and suddenly fall

Now, what is this?
Robin you rescued
Has broken wing
Not broken long
You search the room
Someone yells from the garden
The orange cat
Finish what you started

Now, what is this?
Skidding of tires
I hold my breath
And you're running fast
As the SUV
Smashes into the sidewalk
And 911
Won't answer the call

Now, what is this?
Hollywood ghost town
A shootout scene
No actors at all
Last night I dreamed
You and I were immortal
It's no big deal
This new kind of normal

"Hit Me Where It Hurts"

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
Go on and hit me in the

Bullseye, dead end
Moving target
Carousel, carousel
Baggage, claim it
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out
Ride it out, ride it out

Magic carpet
Over London
Through the ceiling
Watch you dreaming
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out
Ride it out

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
Go on and hit me in the

Blind spot, Achilles' heel
Long shot, left field
Vertigo, vertigo
High stakes, popped ears
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out
Ride it out, ride it out

Do you feel safe?
(Hit me where it hurts now)
Now that you've found my cure?
I'll be the nurse
(Hit me where it hurts now)
You'll be my number one
Hit me where it hurts now
Hit me where it hurts
Hit me where it hurts now
Hit me where it hurts
Hit me where it hurts now
Hit me where it hurts
Hit me where it hurts now

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane (Hit me where it hurts)
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
Go on and hit me in the

"I Give Up"

When I stop caring, you stop caring
When I care less and you care less than me
When I don't need and I don't believe in
The hollow phrases you still repeat
You and I, we fall apart
Now I know what it means to unravel
It's a new and shallow grief
A pathetic kind of sad relief

It didn't used to feel this good to be all alone
Doing every damn thing I can to not go home

I give up
I give up on you now
I give up
How far can you fall
When you're already down?

I gave you that told-you-so look, it's so crazy
And you gave me that list of things about myself to change
And now these days it's every night, babe
It's not a rough patch, it's not a phase
You and I, we fall apart
Now I know what it means to unravel
It's a new and shallow grief
And a pathetic kind of self-defeat

It didn't used to feel this good to be all alone
Doing every damn thing I can to not go home

I give up
I give up on you now
I give up
How far can you fall
When you're already down?
I give up
I give up on you now
I give up
How far can you fall
When you're already down?

"Look At Me Now"

Wrote myself a letter
Just a single question
When you finally get this
Where will you be?
Will you be a shipwreck or a star
Falling for a boy who doesn't play guitar?
Now rewind the tape back to the start
Said I'd never leave you, but here we are

And you can't look at me now
I haven't changed, I'm still the same
But you can't look at me now
A hand grenade to throw away

Now my friends all tell me
"Girl, you're getting skinny
Have you not been sleeping?"
How could I be?
Trying to find the lightswitch in the dark
Burying the good girl I know I'm not
Now rewind the tape back to the start
Said I'd never leave you, but here we are

And you can't look at me now
I haven't changed, I'm still the same
But you can't look at me now
A hand grenade to throw away

I can't run anymore
Gotta stay right here and face the storm
I can't run anymore
Where the wakeup call is all I know
I can't run anymore
(I can't run anymore)
Gotta stay right here and face the storm
I can't run anymore
(I can't run anymore)

You can't look at me now
I haven't changed, I'm still the same
But you can't look at me now
A hand grenade to throw away
Look at me now
(I can't run anymore)
You can't look at me now
(I can't run anymore)

"Insomnia"

How long can sunlight stay warm in the storm?
How long 'til the bath runs cold?

Come dawn, come day, come half-awake
Come blue, come gray, come waves that break
And it's not enough
No reply, no relief

Dreams of dried fields
That once were green
Burnt by someone just like me

Come dawn, come day, come half-awake
Come blue, come gray, come waves that break
And it's not enough
No reply, no relief

Hold on
Hold on
To save a single living piece of us
I still got it
I still got your heat

"Ocean Of Tears"

This is gonna be torture
Before it's sublime
Does that make it crazy?
Cash in all of my courage
Before you're all mine
Does that make it crazy?

Oh my god, I wanna know what it feels like
To pull you close and tangle up with you real tight
The only thing that's separating you and me tonight
Ah, is an ocean of tears
Oh my god, I wanna know what it feels like
Just an inch away from living a dream life
The only thing that's separating you and me tonight
Ah, is an ocean of tears

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Show me the future
Yeah, I'm all eyes
Tell me you're ready (I'm ready)
Pulse was rising and racing and racing and racing
But it's a long ride
Tell me you're ready

Oh my god, I wanna know what it feels like
To pull you close and tangle up with you real tight
The only thing that's separating you and me tonight
Ah, is an ocean of tears
Oh my god, I wanna know what it feels like
Just an inch away from living a dream life
The only thing that's separating you and me tonight
Ah, is an ocean of tears

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Someone stop me, I'm coming down
Ooh, ooh
Someone stop me, I'm coming down
Ooh, ooh

Show me the fu-fu-fu-, fu-fu-
Yeah, all eyes

"Hey Big Eyes"

I can picture you right now
At a window seat
Crying for nobody except the world
I can picture you right now
Running down the street
Late for nobody except the moon

Hey, big eyes, can you swim
Swim down to me?
Hey, red star, can you burn
Burn down to me?

Picture me all messed up now
Can't talk to nobody
Canât plan for anything
Except the rain
Today the flags will all fly green
At the embassies
You're here next to me
Except you're not

Hey, big eyes, can you swim
Swim down to me? (Swim, swim)
Hey, red star, can you burn
Burn down to me? (Burn, burn)

Hey, big eyes, can you swim
Swim down to me?
Hey, red star, can you burn?
Burn down, burn down

Hey, big eyes, can you swim
Swim down to me? (Swim, swim)
Hey, red star, can you burn
Burn down to me? (Burn, burn)

"Go As A Dream"

Someone changed the clock
And left the window open
When I must have drifted off
And it's just your kind of trick
To leave me empty-handed
Leave me with a riddle unsolved

Ah, ah, mmm
I don't know if I can do this
I don't know if I can make this peace

And you're almost like that card
Played by the magician
But this time, you're not coming back
And it's slipping through my fists
Blurry at the edges
Leaving only legend

You go as a dream
Go as a dream
Go as a dream
Go as a dream

Ah, ah, mmm
I don't know if I can do this
I don't know if I can make this peace

And it hit me like a brick
A joke without a punchline
A script that nobody read
If you saw me lying here
Through my bedroom ceiling
You would have me pick up my head and

Go as a dream
Go as a dream
Go as a dream
Go as a dream

Ah, ah, mmm
Ah, ah, mmm

"Caroline Shut Up"

Sometimes, I wonder
Do I love you too much?
Then I tell myself, "Caroline, shut up"
'Cause there's only one way
One way to find out
If it ever gets better than right now

I dare you to come closer
Let me see you in the light
I dare you to stay with me
You know I get low sometimes
I dare you to make time stop
Instead of speeding up
I dare you to go slow, don't rush

Sometimes, I wonder
Do I love you too much?
Then I tell myself, "Caroline, shut up"
'Cause there's only one way
One way to find out
If it ever gets better than right now

Na, na, na, na (Oh)
Now you got me jealous and I'm not the jealous type
Na, na, na, na (Oh)
Spending all the cash that I'm saving up
Na, na, na, na (Oh)
Lying in the bath made of a fountain of wine
Na, na, na, na (Oh)
Looking like a god, you know you fuck me up

Sometimes, I wonder
Do I love you too much?
Then I tell myself, "Caroline, shut up"
'Cause there's only one way
One way to find out
If it ever gets better than right now

And this is hard, God
Give me scissors and I'm running on the tightrope
And I've gotta trust it now, ah
Just don't let go
(Sometimes I, sometimes I, sometimes I)

Sometimes, I wonder
Do I love you too much?
Then I tell myself, "Caroline, shut up"
If tomorrow, you want me
Then I don't have a doubt
That it gets even better than right now

"So Hot You're Hurting My Feelings"

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Not like I'm counting the days (Ah, ah, ah)
But it's been twenty-five (Ah, ah, ah)
You're out there killing the game (Ah, ah, ah)
But damn, I miss you tonight (Ah, ah, mmm)

And I'm out at a party, they're playing our song
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing
Don't send me photos, you're making it worse
'Cause you're so hot it's hurting my feelings

I get a little lonely
Get a little more close to me
You're the only one who knows me, babe
So hot you're hurting my feelings (Woo)
Can't deal

With all the X-rated dreamin' (Ah, ah, ah)
Back on the coast-to-coast life (Ah, ah, ah)
You know I live for the hustle (Ah, ah, ah)
But damn, I miss you tonight (Ah, ah, mmm)

And I'm out at a party, they're playing our song
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing
Don't send me photos, you're making it worse

"Door"

Back in the city
I'm just another girl in a sweater
Perpetual novice
Signature on a check made out to you

Took ten laps 'round the planet
To prove what I wasn't
And the door slams hard behind you
When you leave the house of judgment

Been waiting for regret to hit me
Some kind of reckoning
I waited for the drop, 'cause lately
The yang comes with yin

Back in the city
I'm just another girl in a sweater
Perpetual novice
Signature on a check made out to you
Now there's the sunset
Salt in the wound, yeah
Sometimes I don't know who I'm singing to
Who is the you who I sing to
When the house is empty?

You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you
You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you

And we're waking up sore and dizzy
From a ten year concussion
And the rainfall makes you miss me
Even though you say it doesn't

Back in the city
I'm just another girl in a sweater
Back in the city
Everything's different when we're not together

You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you
You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you

Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running

Back in the city
I'm just another girl in a sweater
Perpetual novice
Signature on a check made out to you
Now there's the sunset
Salt in the wound, yeah
Sometimes I don't know who I'm singing to
Who is the you who I sing to
When the house is empty?

You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you
You open the door
To another door, to another door
To another door, to another door
And I'm running through to you

Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running
Oh, oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Ooh, ah
Ooh, ah
Ooh, oh
Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running

"Parachute"

Awake from a dream
One that started as a nightmare
Like a war so extreme
It erased itself from memory
Here's where I jumped
From the aeroplane without questioning it
The curve of the coast of Los Angeles
Spreading itself below

And blooming overhead, the parachute
I've got to trust it now, oh

Change in the wind
And I'm drifting from the crescent
Pulled farther out
From the shore than where I can swim to it

And blooming overhead, the parachute
I've got to trust it now, oh

Closing in on the sparkle of the waves
Go on, take me, it will feel like going home
Go on, take me, I'm not afraid to drown
What is this, pulling me back the other way
To strip malls, highways, and treetops
Landing on the soft ground

"Welcome To My Island"

Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
Hope you like me, you ain't leavin'
Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
Hope you like me, you ain't leavin'

Desire (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna turn into you
Desire (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I wanna turn into you
Flood (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
The ocean blue
Flood (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
The ocean blue

Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
Hope you like me, you ain't leavin'

Desire (Hey, hey, hey, hey)

I am my father's daughter in the end
He says, "Watch your ego, watch your head, girl
You're so smart, so talented
But now the water's turning red
And it's all your fault and it's all your mess
And you're all alone, you can't go to bed
Too high on your adrenaline
You gotta go somewhere where you can't pretend, oh
Forget the rules, forget your friends
Just you and your reflection
'Cause nothing's gonna be the same again
No, nothing's gonna be the same again"

"Pretty In Possible"

Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da (Mmm)
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da (Mmm)

Time's running out, innit?
Pity the mayflies in the swimming pool at dawn
But down in the deep
I can't be left alone
Sweet Eliza's on the court
Potential is the drug
They never knew, you never tried
But you see it in my eyes, and that is bae
Threading the needle, pretty in possible
If only to get me out the door
Oracle and odyssey
With a bloody nose
If I'm on your street, you'll be the last to know
That I get dizzy (Yeah), dizzy (Yeah) and I cannot afford that kind of free

Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da (Mmm)
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da (Well, how does it feel)
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da (Being so, you know)
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da (Rich?), da-da (Mmm)

Now you got one eye on the lane and one eye on the lava
Spinning out, yeah, I respect that
But I was born to get you home
Home, where it's all red and velveteen
Falling back into the leaves
So true
With your lipstick on my thigh
Drink the tears until they dry-y-y
I-I, I-I, I-I (Eye eye eye eye eye)

Mm-mm-mm, oh
Pretty in possible
Mm-mm-mm, oh
Pretty in possible
Mm-mm-mm, oh
Pretty in possible (Fragile)
Mm-mm-mm, oh
Pretty in possible

Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da

"Bunny Is a Rider"

Bunny is a rider
Satellite can't find her
No sympathy, hmm
Ain't nothing for free
Bunny is a rider
Satellite can't find her
No sympathy, hmm
Ain't nothing for free
Bunny is a rider
No sympathy, hmm
Ain't nothing
Bunny is a-Bunny is a, a rider
Satellite can't find her

But I'm so non-physical
I do, I do, feel like the lady
I do, I do, fireworks blazing
I do, I do, heart is unbreaking
I do, I do, but don't drop my name

Bunny is a rider (Bunny is a r...)
Satellite can't find her
No sympathy, hmm
Ain't nothing for free
Bunny is a rider
Giddy up, can't find her
No sympathy, hmm
Ain't nothing for free

Dirty like it's earth day
Tryna wet that palette
Can you cut that check
Crush that wreck
Run out empty on 'em
AWOL on a Thursday
Tryna go ask Alice
Tryna catch that rabbit

But I'm so non-physical
I do, I do, feel like the lady
I do, I do, fireworks blazing
I do, I do, heart is unbreaking
I do, I do, but don't drop my name

Bunny is a-Bunny is a, a rider

"Sunset"

These days
I wear my body like an uninvited guest
I turn it right and right and right
Instead of turning left
But boy, your patience is a magic kind of medicine
'Cause every spiral brings me
Back into your arms again

So no regrets
'Cause you're my sunset
Fiery red
Forever fearless
And in your arms
A warm horizon
Don't look back
Let's ride away
Let's ride away

So many stories we were told about a safety net
But when I look for it, it's just a hand that's holding mine
I'm wearing black to mourn the sudden loss of innocence
And that's alright because it hides the dirt and hides the wine

So no regrets
'Cause you're my sunset
Fiery red
Forever fearless
And in your arms
A warm horizon
Don't look back
Let's ride away
Let's ride away

So no regrets
'Cause you're my sunset
Fiery red
Forever fearless
And in your arms
A warm horizon
Don't look back
Let's ride away (Let's ride away)

"Crude Drawing Of An Angel"

Draw the blinds
Draw the bath
It's a matter of time
Til you wake up and watch me
Draw your brow
With shaky hand
So that after you're gone
I got something to hold onto

Red light
Oh my faults
Camera one, camera two
Oh my greed
On your side, on the carpet
Oh your need
Camera one, camera two

Angel
I'd hold you down
Forsake me
Here on the ground
All or nothing

Draw your blood
Draw your breath
Skip the whites of your eyes
Til you wake up and watch me
Draw your wings
From your back
I'll not be shy
No, I'll not be gentle with you

Red light
Oh my faults
Camera one, camera two
Oh my greed
On your side, on the carpet
Oh your need
Camera one, camera two

Angel
I'd hold you down
Forsake me
Here on the ground
All or nothing

All or nothing

"I Believe"

(Look over the edge, but not too far)

You're not alone
Under a sky of vultures
With all that could've been
You made it home
With silver string unbroken
Ain't that the sweetest gift

Oh, little miracle
Swing low
Where there can be no compromises
Down low

I don't know but I believe
We'll get another day together
Violent love, feel my embrace, oh
No, I don't know but I believe

And I'd have said it was impossible
To find you in this life and keep you just enough

Oh, little miracle
Swing low
Where there can be no compromises
Down low

I don't know but I believe (Oh)
We'll get another day together (Oh)
Violent love, feel my embrace, oh (Oh)
No, I don't know but I believe

(Look over the edge, but not too far)
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh (Look over the edge, but not too far)
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh

I don't know but I believe
We'll get another day together
Violent love, feel my embrace, oh
No, I don't know but I believe (Ah)

Violent love, feel my embrace
(Look over the edge, but not too far)
(But not too far)

"Fly To You"
(feat. Grimes & Dido)

How I remember, how I forget
Wanted to hate you but love you instead
Violence made me gentle at last
Closer and closer and closer to you
Baby, I'm dying to find you

Ooh, I fly to you (Hey)
After all the tears (Hey)
You're all I need (Hey)
I fly to you (Woo)
Not just somewhere
Deep inside of me (Hey)

Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah (Hey)
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah (Hey)
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah (Woo)
Ah-ah

Driving through the dark
Lost but I'm free
I'm looking for something
That nobody else can see (See)
Will you still love me
After the bend? (The bend)
Remember what's gone before
Not loaded with regret (Regret)

Ooh, I fly to you (Hey)
After all the tears (Hey)
You're all I need (Hey)
I fly to you (Woo)
Not just somewhere
Deep inside of me (Hey)

(Hey)
(Hey)
(Woo)

Mmm, I fly to you
After all the tears
You're all I need
I fly to you
Not just somewhere
Deep inside of me (How I remember)
Ooh, I fly to you (How I forget)
After all the tears (Wanted to hate you, but love you instead)
You're all I need (violence made me)
I fly to you (Gentle at last)
Not just somewhere (Closer and closer and closer to you)
Deep inside of me (Baby, I'm dying to find out)

I'm looking for something
Nobody else can see
Remember what's gone before
Not loaded with regret

"Blood And Butter"

I look at you, in denim and bows
I know the mode, the mode is lethal
Say you wanna show me your place
The place is here, the here is inside you
Where did you come from, you?

I'm pretty with the critical mass
Your body has the body power
Layin' at the foot of a linden
In the navel ring, inventing June
Where did you come from, you?

And what I want is, to walk beside you
Needing nothing, but the sun that's in our eyes
Paint the picture in blood and butter
Holy water, fire in sky

Let me dive through your face
To the sweetest kind of pain
Call you up, nothin' to say
No, I don't need no one entertaining
When the world is a bed
Give me green and ribbon red
Oh, get closer than your new tattoo

Look at you all mythicalogical
And wikipediated
Look how I forget who I was
Before I was the way I am with you
Where did you come from, you?

And what I want is, to walk beside you
Needing nothing, but the sun that's in our eyes
Paint the picture in blood and butter
Holy water, fire in sky

Let me dive through your face
To the sweetest kind of pain
Call you up, nothin' to say
No, I don't need no one entertaining
When the world is a bed
Give me green and ribbon red
Oh, get closer than your new tattoo

Closer than yourâ

"Hopedrunk Everasking"

Starlight in the tunnel
Kind of familiar
Hope-drunk ever-asking
How does it feel to know?
Your final form?
So old, so new

Pull close to me
And never be alone
Ooh

Real life is a rumor
Under the theatre
Deeper, dig it deeper
Till the meanwhile slows
They'll find our bones
And yet, they won't

Pull close to me
And never be alone
Ooh (Ah)

(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)

Dawn is just a headspace
Night is a feeling
Hope-drunk ever-asking
Centuries come and go
They'll find our bones
And yet, they won't

"Butterfly Net"

Earth went silent
London fell asleep
She dreamed of winter
Where you appeared to me
Perfect timing as new petals in November
A tender creature
A fever
Disarming, fluorescent

There you were
With your mirror
Shining the world all over me
There I was
With my butterfly net
Trying to catch your light

I collected
Stupid ashes
So that after you'd gone
I could hold onto something
But you stayed unwavering
Through every false goodbye
Unsubsiding
Pining
For now and for never

There you were
With your mirror
Shining the world all over me
There I was
With my butterfly net
Trying to catch your light

Oh if only
The umbrella of the sky
Could wrap us up and up
That's where I'd zoom in close
Dilated as your eyes
But til then I'll keep it brief

Faithful inertia
Her bullet doesn't slow
It seeks and finds me
How far it goes
Heaven help me
Take this bag of wings
And drown it in the thames
And wake tomorrow
Hollow
Hardly forgetting

There you were...
There I was
With my butterfly net
Trying to catch your light

Selling me out on the down low

And you are
The big answer tonight
And you are
Melting everything about me, oh
Don't worry about me
It's just smoke

(Ah, mmm)

And the fallout doesn't phase me
Take a bullet for my baby
For the one thing that'll save me
I know (Hmm)
Throw it all out and replace it
With a brand new kind of crazy
Don't believe it when you praise me
Do I (Hmm)

And you are
The big answer tonight

"Hit Me Where It Hurts (Toro Y Moi Remix)"
(feat. Chino Moreno)

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
Go on and hit me in the

Bullseye, dead end
Moving target
Carousel, carousel
Baggage, claim it
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out
Ride it out, ride it out

Magic carpet
Over London
Through the ceiling
Watch you dreaming
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out
Ride it out

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
Go on and hit me in the

Blind spot, Achilles' heel
Long shot, left field
Vertigo, vertigo
High stakes, popped ears
Promise one day
You will hate me
But right now, just ride it out

Do you feel safe?
Now that you've found my cure?
I'll be the nurse
You'll be my number one

I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time, then make it worse
Go on and hit me in the heart, hit me where it hurts
I'm feeling like a butterfly trapped inside a plane
Maybe there's something going on, I'm not insane
If I'm already out of time

But it's been twenty-five (Ah, ah, ah)
You're out there riding the sleigh (Ah, ah, ah) (Ho-ho-ho)
But damn, I miss you tonight (Ah, ah, mmm)

And I'm out at a party, they're playing our song

"Welcome To My Island (George Daniel & Charli XCX Remix)"

I like to live my life luxurious
Eating caviar toast, buying out the Ritz
I've been told I can be tricky in relationships
'Cause I need someone who can take on all the challenges
I won't lie, yeah, I've always been afraid to commit
But now I've fallen so hard, it's a total eclipse
'Cause it's emotional and physical and so legit
He's got my legs wide out like banana split
We're always showering each other in expensive gifts
I put the two-tone Cartier on his wrist
It was love at first sight from the moment we kissed
I want a white dress, country side house, and kids
Back at the start, think you knew that I was dangerous
With my face enhanced and my natural lips
I told him, "Catch a flight, see if you can handle it
And if you can then, welcome to my island, bitch"

Welcome to my island, bitch
Welcome to my island, bitch
Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island, bitch
Welcome to my island
I wanna turn into you

I guess I'm on my Richard Branson wave
No virgin, but I knew just how to behave
'Cause I can be a good girl, buxom milkmaid
Or you can drive me down to Florida and fuck me for days
Back at the start, think you knew that I was dangerous
I've done a couple bad things if you catch my drift
I told him, "Baby, you can pull up on the landing strip
And if you do it right, welcome to my island, bitch"

Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island, bitch
Welcome to my island
I wanna turn into you
Welcome to my island, bitch
Desire
I wanna turn into you
Welcome to my island, bitch
Desire
I wanna turn into you

Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
Hope you like me, you ain't leavin'
Welcome to my island
See the palm trees wave in the wind
Welcome to my island
I wanna turn into you

I wanna turn into you
I wanna turn into you
