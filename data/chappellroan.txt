"Die Young"

Run with the devil, go ahead run free
Run with the devil and dream
Smoke that cigarette, puff those rings
Blow it in my face as I breathe
It's alright now, you're just high now
You'll be fine now, you're just high now

Look at your mama, now she's crying
'Cause she thinks her baby's dying
Don't put up a fight, she just wants to hold you tight
And look at your daddy, he hates lying
Tried to help you, but he's sick of trying
Look at your life, he just wants to make it right
And you got everything and more than enough
If you could have anything, what would you want?

You say, "I wanna die young"
Wanna die young
You say, "I wanna die young"
Wanna die young

Sleep with the devil, go dance with him
It's your life, do what you want to
Baby, why you so locked up in lies?
Don't you know you could have the truth
You say I'm boring, so you ignore me
You hear the phone ring, so you ignore me

Look at your mama, now she's crying
'Cause she thinks her baby's dying
Don't put up a fight, she just wants to hold you tight
And look at your daddy, he hates lying
Tried to help you, but he's sick of trying
Look at your life, he just wants to make it right
And you got everything and more than enough
If you could have anything, what would you want?

You say, "I wanna die young"
Wanna die young
You say, "I wanna die young"
Wanna die young

You say "I don't know how I lost myself"
With a bottle at the bottom of an ashtray
Smoking my regrets and realizing what I need to do is pray

And I know I've got more than enough
And I think I know now what I really want

And I think I want love, wanna find love
And I wanna be loved, wanna find love
And I sure as hell don't wanna die young
Don't wanna die young, wanna die young

"Good Hurt"

I know I'm impatient
Bite your tongue or I'll do it for you
You can taste hesitation
Mouth to mouth conversation
And I've even tried medication
Cold hearted frustration
You can call it foundation
I'll call you when I'm wasted

Oh, I should know better
Oh, I should know better

All I really want is that good hurt
I know in my head I could do better
No one else compares to who I had first
All I really want is that good hurt
That good hurt
That good hurt

Lied when I said I love you
Didn't mean to say it but I
Know you're not delusional
Guess that I was manipulative
You can call me Medusa
Bite you good but I'll leave you colder
Use me just like I used you
Till it's over

Oh, I should know better
Oh, I should know better

All I really want is that good hurt
I know in my head I could do better
No one else compares to who I had first
All I really want is that good hurt
That good hurt
That good hurt

I guess I will lay here while you move
And think it through but I can't help but wish that it was you
On my body, make good hurt stay
I just wanna feel that pain

All I really want is that good hurt
I know in my head I could do better
No one else compares to who I had first
All I really want is that good hurt
That good hurt
That good hurt

"Meantime"

I first left to a summer camp
Feel my skeleton, can you make my brittle bones strong?
Remember when we talked so long?
Quiet behind bedroom walls
The light made your eyes so big

And I keep my doubts in the back of my mind
And I still love you in the meantime
Cut me slack while I figure it out
And I still love you in the meantime

In the meantime
Can I love you in the meantime?

And I keep my doubts in the back of my mind
And I still love you in the meantime
Cut me slack while I figure it out
And I still love you in the meantime

In the meantime
Can I love you in the meantime?
In the meantime
Can I love you in the meantime?

Twist me, licorice
Speak with your fingertips
Tell me what you want me to do
Can you meet me by the swimming pool
After hours, when the air is cool?
I've got things I don't know how to say

Can I love you in the meantime?
Can I love you in the meantime?

"Sugar High"

Chocolate covered lover, you've never been so sweet before
Open our bodies, I quietly knock on your door
I-I-I just wanna sweet talk for awhile
Whisper all the things I absolutely adore
About your smile, it's like I'm in a candy store
Oh-h-h, I love your sugar coating words

Maybe it's the way the honey drips off of your lips
Maybe it's the taste of your caramel apple kiss

And your heart is so sweet, all that sugar loving, it belongs to me
Candy man, you are mine
You know how you get me, get me sugar high
High, oh, high
High, oh, high

Your cotton candy voice melts in my mouth as you speak
Beautiful boy, your words are made of poetry
I-I-I could listen to you all day

Maybe it's the way you laffy taffy love
Maybe it's the way you run your hands up my back

And your heart is so sweet, all that sugar loving, it belongs to me
Candy man, you are mine
You know how you get me, get me sugar high
High, oh, high
High, oh, high

Maybe it's the way you lay me down at night
Or how you turn November into hot summer July

And your heart is so sweet, all that sugar loving, it belongs to me
Candy man, you are mine
You know how you get me, get me sugar high

"Bad For You"

You know that I won't hold you back
When you think of things you shouldn't
Things you want to do to me
Bare skin to sink my teeth in
Wrap my tongue around you as I hold you with my lungs

I bet you wonder what I'm doing when I'm alone in my room
When I'm alone in my room
And darling, I'm telling you it comes easy when I'm thinking about you
When I'm thinking about you

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you

Goddess, I'll be your goddess
Lace your fingers round my neck, it's pleasure I can't take

Bet I know exactly what you're doing when you're alone in your room
When you're alone in your room
Darling, tell me if you're having trouble and I'm sure I could help you
I'm sure I could help you

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you

Blood on your back
I give you your pride
I am all yours and you are all mine

Hallelujah, hallelujah
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you
Oh, forgive me for I love being bad for you

"Femininomenon"

Same old story, time again
Got so close but then you lost it
Should've listened to your friends
About his girlfriend back in Boston
You sent him pictures and playlists and phone sex
He disappeared from the second that you said
"Let's get coffee, let's meet up"
I'm so sick of online love
And I don't understand
Why can't any man

Hit it like...
Get it hot...
Make a bitch...
It's a fem...
Hit it like...
Get it hot...
Make a bitch...
It's a-
Um, can you play a song with a fucking beat?

Hit it like rom-pom-pom-pom (Hit it like)
Get it hot like Papa John (Get it hot)
Make a bitch go on and on (Make a bitch)
It's a femininomenon (It's a fem)

So let's say it's working out
You pretend to love his mother
Lying to your friends about
How he's such a goddamn good lover
Stuck in the suburbs, you're folding his laundry
Got what you wanted so stop feeling sorry
Crying at the nail salon
I'm so sick of online love
And I don't understand
Why can't any man

Hit it like...
Get it hot...
Make a bitch...
It's a fem...
Hit it like...
Get it hot...
Make a bitch...
It's a-
Dude, can you play a song with a fucking beat?

Hit it like rom-pom-pom-pom (Hit it like)
Get it hot like Papa John (Get it hot)
Make a bitch go on and on (Make a bitch)
It's a femininomenon (It's a fem)

Ladies
You know what I mean
And you know what you need
And so does he
But does it happen? (No!)
But does it happen? (No!)
Well, what we really need is a femininomenon
(A what?)
A femininomenon

Hit it like rom-pom-pom-pom (Hit it like)
Get it hot like Papa John (Get it hot)
Make a bitch go on and on (Make a bitch)

"Red Wine Supernova"

She was a playboy
Brigitte Bardot
She showed me things
I didn't know
She did it right there
Out on the deck
Put her canine teeth
In the side of my neck

I'm in the hallway waitin' for ya
Mini skirt and my go-go boots

So slow down, sit down, it's new

Let's make this bed get squeaky

Baby, why don't you come over?
Red Wine Supernova
Falling into me
I don't care that you're a stoner
Red Wine Supernova
Fall right into me

"After Midnight"

My mama said nothing good happens
When it's late and you're dancing alone
She's in my head saying it's not attractive
Wearing that dress and red lipstick

This is what I wanted, this is what I like
I've been a good, good girl for a long time
But baby, I like flirting, a lover by my side
Can't be a good, good girl even if I tried

'Cause after midnight
I'm feeling kinda freaky, maybe it's the club lights
I kinda wanna kiss your girlfriend if you don't mind
I love a little drama, let's start a bar fight

'Cause everything good happens after midnight
I'm feeling kinda freaky, maybe it's the moonlight
I kinda wanna kiss your boyfriend if you don't mind
I love a little uh-huh, let's watch the sunrise
'Cause everything good happens after

I really want your hands on my body
A slow dance, baby, let's get it on
That's my type of fun, that's my kind of party
Your hands on my body, your hot hands

This is what I wanted, this is what I like
I've been a good, good girl for a long time
But baby, I like flirting, a lover by my side
Can't be a good, good girl even if I tried

'Cause after midnight
I'm feeling kinda freaky, maybe it's the club lights
I kinda wanna kiss your girlfriend if you don't mind
I love a little drama, let's start a bar fight

'Cause everything good happens after midnight
I'm feeling kinda freaky, maybe it's the moonlight
I kinda wanna kiss your boyfriend if you don't mind
I love a little uh-huh, let's watch the sunrise
'Cause everything good happens after midnight

Baby, put your hands up
Be a freak in the club
Yeah, we'll make a move then we're making out
Yeah, we'll make, a-make love

Yeah, we'll make, a-make love
Be a freak in the club
Be a freak in club

After midnight
I'm feeling kinda freaky, maybe it's the club lights (Club lights)
I kinda wanna kiss your girlfriend if you don't mind (If you don't, if you don't mind)
I love a little drama, let's start a bar fight (Everybody wants make a little love, get drunk)

'Cause everything good happens after midnight
I'm feeling kinda freaky, maybe it's the moonlight (Moonlight)
I kinda wanna kiss your boyfriend if you don't mind (If you don't, if you don't mind)
I love a little uh-huh, let's watch the sunrise
'Cause everything good happens after

"Coffee"

Can't meet you for dinner at the Italian place
It's where I met your family, some words were exchanged
I'd suggest the jazz bar on MaryAnn Street, but
You'd buy me a drink, and we know where that leads, so

I'll meet you for coffee 'cause if we have wine
You'll say that you want me, I know that's a lie
If I didn't love you, it would be fine
I'll meet you for coffee, only for coffee
Nowhere else is safe, every place leads back to your place

You said let's do the park, 'cause I love the park
That may be true, but God forbid it gets dark
Here come the excuses that fuel the illusions
But I'd rather feel something than nothing at all, so

I'll meet you for coffee 'cause if we have wine
You'll say that you're sorry, I know that's a lie
If I didn't trust you, it would be fine
I'll meet you for coffee, only for coffee
Nowhere else is safe, every place leads back to your-

We've done this before
And I don't need it anymore

So let's not do coffee, let's not even try
It's better we leave it and give it some time
If I didn't love you, it would be fine
'Cause If we do coffee, it's never just coffee
It's never just coffee

"Casual"

My friends call me a loser
'Cause I'm still hanging around
I've heard so many rumors
That I'm just a girl that you bang on your couch
I thought you thought of me better
Someone you couldn't lose
You said, "We're not together"
So now when we kiss, I have anger issues

You said, "Baby, no attachment"
But we're...

Knee deep in the passenger seat and you're eating me out
Is it casual now?
Two weeks and your mom invites me to her house on Long Beach
Is it casual now?
I know what you tell your friends
It's casual, if it's casual now
But baby, get me off again
If it's casual, it's casual now

Dumb love, I love being stupid
Dream of us in a year
Maybe we'd have an apartment
And you'd show me off to your friends at the pier

I know, "Baby, no attachment"
But we're...

Knee deep in the passenger seat and you're eating me out
Is it casual now?
Two weeks and your mom invites me to her house on Long Beach
Is it casual now?
I know what you tell your friends
It's casual, if it's casual now
But baby, get me off again
If it's casual, oh, oh, oh

It's hard being casual
When my favorite bra lives in your dresser
It's hard being casual
When I'm on the phone talking down your sister
And I try to be the chill girl that
Holds her tongue and gives you space
I try to be the chill girl but
Honestly, I'm not

Knee deep in the passenger seat and you're eating me out
Two weeks and your mom invites me to her Long Beach house
I know what you tell your friends
Baby, get me off again
I fucked you in the bathroom when we went to dinner
Your parents at the table, you wonder why I'm bitter
Bragging to your friends I get off when you hit it
I hate to tell the truth but I'm sorry dude you didn't
I hate that I let this drag on so long, now I hate myself
I hate that I let this drag on so long, you can go to hell

"Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl"

You know what they say, "Never waste a Friday night on a first date"
But there I was, in my heels with my hair straight
And so I take him to this bar, this man wouldn't dance
He didn't ask a single question
And he was wearing these fugly jeans
It doesn't matter though, he doesn't have what it takes to be
With a girl like me

Not overdramatic, I know what I want
We're leaving the planet and you can't come

Uh-huh, I'm through with all these hyper mega bummer boys like you
Oh yeah, I need a super graphic ultra modern girl like me
We're hot, we're drunk, wow, look at her moving, baby, she's the one
Oh yeah, I need a super graphic ultra modern girl like me

Telling secrets there on the mattress
Wearing nothing but glitter and lashes
At every party we're the party, shaking our asses
Making out while the world collapses

Not overdramatic, I know what I want
We're leaving the planet and you can't come

Uh-huh, I'm through with all these hyper mega bummer boys like you
Oh yeah, I need a super graphic ultra modern girl like me
We're hot, we're drunk, wow, look at her moving, baby, she's the one
Oh yeah, I need a super graphic ultra modern girl like me
(Shake it for me)

Get up off your feet, get up on that bar
Walk that walk from Tokyo to New York
With everything you feel and everything you are
Walk that walk, flash the camera, flash the camera, flash the camera, you're a star

Uh-huh, I'm through with all these hyper mega bummer boys like you
Oh yeah, I need a super graphic ultra modern girl like me
We're hot, we're drunk, wow, look at her moving, baby, she's the one
Oh yeah, I need a super graphic ultra modern
Ooh, you got me la-la-la-ing
Hyper-sexy top to bottom
Girl like me

"HOT TO GO!"

Five, six
Five, six, seven, eight

I could be the one or your new addiction
It's all in my head, but I want non-fiction
I don't want the world, but I'll take this city
Who can blame a girl? Call me hot, not pretty

Baby, do you like this beat?
I made it so you'd dance with me
It's like a hundred ninety-nine degrees
When you're doing it with me, doing it with me

H-O-T-T-O-G-O
Snap n' clap n' and touch your toes
Raise your hands, now body roll
Dance it out, you're hot to go
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
Snap n' clap n' touch your toes
Raise your hands, now body roll
H-O-T-T-O-G-O

H-O-T-T-O-G-O
You can take me hot to go
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
You can take me hot to go

Well, I woke up alone staring at my ceiling
I try not to care, but it hurts my feelings
You don't have to stare, come here, get with it
No one's touched me there in a damn hot minute

And baby, don't you like this beat?
I made it so you'd sleep with me
It's like a hundred ninety-nine degrees
When you're doing it with me, doing it with me

H-O-T-T-O-G-O
Snap n' clap n' and touch your toes
Raise your hands, now body roll
Dance it out, you're hot to go

Okay, it's hot

"My Kink Is Karma"

We broke up on a Tuesday
Kicked me out with the rent paid
Ruined my credit, stole my cute aesthetic
Who knew that we'd let it
Get this bad when it ended

It's comical, bridges you burn
Karma's real, hope it's your turn
I heard from Katie
You're losing it lately
Moved back with your parents
And date girls who're eighteen

It's hot when you have a meltdown
In the front of your house and you're getting kicked out
It's hot when you're drinking downtown
And you're getting called out 'cause you're running your mouth
Oh, God
And it's coming around, yeah, it's coming around, yeah, it's coming around
Oh, God, oh, God
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching

You ruining your life
You losing your mind
You dyeing your hair
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching
You crashing your car
You breaking your heart
You thinking I care
People say I'm jealous but my kink is karma

Wishing you the best, in the worst way
Using your distress as foreplay
Six months since April and I'm doing better
No need to be hateful in your fake Gucci sweater

But it's hot when you have a meltdown
In the front of your house and you're getting kicked out
It's hot when you're drinking downtown
And you're getting called out 'cause you're running your mouth
Oh, God
And it's coming around, yeah, it's coming around, yeah, it's coming around
Oh, God, oh, God
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching

You ruining your life
You losing your mind
You dyeing your hair
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching
You crashing your car
You breaking your heart
You thinking I care
People say I'm jealous but my kink is karma

It's hot when you're going through hell
And you're hating yourself, I'm feeling myself
It's hot when you know that you're caught
And you're getting pissed off, it's getting me off
It's hot, it's hot
Oh, God, oh, God
Oh, God
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching

You ruining your life
You losing your mind
You dyeing your hair
People say I'm jealous but my kink is watching
You crashing your car
You breaking your heart
You thinking I care
People say I'm jealous but my kink is karma

"Picture You"

Draw the blinds, light every candle
Slip off my pretty dress, down my chest when I think of you
Every night, both lips on the mirror
It's ritualistic, counting lipstick stains where you should be

Oh, I need you around
I'm getting close now

Do you picture me like I picture you?
Am I in the frame from your point of view?
Do you feel the same? I'm too scared to say
Half of the things I do when I picture you

So tell me now, all your perversions
Tell me now
Am I doing research in a mini skirt
Am I?
At the library in your hometown?

Oh, I need you around
I'm getting close now

Do you picture me like I picture you?
Am I in the frame from your point of view?
Do you feel the same? I'm too scared to say
Half of the things I do when I picture you
When I picture you

Do you picture me like I picture you?
Am I in the frame from your point of view?
Do you feel the same? I'm too scared to say
Half of the things I do when I picture you

"Kaleidoscope"

Here we go again
Everything is fine
I guess we could pretend
We didn't cross a line
But ever since that day
Everything has changed
The way I write your name
The cursive letter A
Whenever it may be
That you go on your way
If you really wanna leave
I'll never make you stay
Whatever you decide
I will understand
And it will all be fine
Just go back to being friends

And love is a kaleidoscope
How it works we'll never know
And even all the change
Is somehow all the same
Turnin' to the left and right
Colors shining in your eye
And even upside down
It's beautiful somehow
It's never just a shape alone
Love is a kaleidoscope

And if you ever find
Someone who could write
A better song for you
Well I'd love to see them try
Put it all in words
And sing it all in tune
There's no one else who could
The only one is you
And if you change your mind
I will understand
And it'll just take time
To go back to being friends

And love is a kaleidoscope
How it works we'll never know
And even all the change
Is somehow all the same
Turning to the left and right
Colors shining in your eye
And even upside down
It's beautiful somehow

Every color of the rainbow
Don't be afraid to hold it close
It's never just a shape alone
Love is a kaleidoscope

"Pink Pony Club"

I know you wanted me to stay
But I can't ignore the crazy visions of me in LA
And I heard that there's a special place
Where boys and girls can all be queens every single day

I'm having wicked dreams
Of leaving Tennessee
Oh, Santa Monica
I swear it's calling me
Won't make my mama proud
It's gonna cause a scene
She sees her baby girl
I know she's gonna scream

God, what have you done
You're a pink pony girl
And you dance at the club
Oh mama, I'm just having fun
On the stage in my heels
It's where I belong down at the
Pink Pony Club
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony Club
I'm gonna keep on dancing down in
West Hollywood
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony Club, Pink Pony Club

I'm up and jaws are on the floor
Lovers in the bathroom and a line outside the door
Blacklights and a mirrored disco ball
Every night's another reason why I left it all

I thank my wicked dreams
A year from Tennessee
Oh, Santa Monica
You've been too good to me
Won't make my mama proud
It's gonna cause a scene
She sees her baby girl
I know she's gonna scream

God, what have you done
You're a pink pony girl
And you dance at the club
Oh mama, I'm just having fun
On the stage in my heels
It's where I belong down at the
Pink Pony club
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony club
I'm gonna keep on dancing down in
West Hollywood
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony club, Pink Pony club

Don't think I've left you all behind
Still love you and Tennessee
You're always on my mind
And mama, every Saturday
I can hear your southern drawl a thousand miles away, saying

God, what have you done
You're a pink pony girl
And you dance at the club
Oh mama, I'm just having fun
On the stage in my heels
It's where I belong down at the
Pink Pony Club
I'm gonna keep on dancing at the
Pink Pony Club
I'm gonna keep on dancing down in

"Naked In Manhattan"

Hi, it's Chappell, I know you just landed
And I know you're probably busy but
I would love to see you so
Call me when you can

New crush, high school love again
The rush of slumber party kissing
Don't touch, I'll never cross the line
So I pushed you down a million times
I'd love if you knew you were on my mind
Constant like cicadas in the summertime
Boys suck and girls I've never tried
And we both know we're getting drunk tonight

Touch me, baby, put your lips on mine
Could go to hell but we'll probably be fine
I know you want it, baby, you can have it
Oh, I've never done it, let's make it cinematic
Like that one sex scene that's in Mulholland Drive
I wanna know, baby, what is it like?
I know you want it, baby, you can have it
Oh, I've never done it, naked in Manhattan

Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)
Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)

A pisces who knew that we were so aligned
When I sing that Lana song, it makes you cry
Mean Girls, we watch it every night
And we both have a crush on Regina George
You love peach and ice cream
Bedazzled, Chanel rings
In New York, you can try things
An inch away from more than just friends

Touch me, baby, put your lips on mine
Could go to hell but we'll probably be fine
I know you want it, baby, you can have it
Oh, I've never done it, naked in Manhattan

Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)
Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)

Red lips and lip gloss
French kissing and crystals
But don't try and it's my loss
An inch away from more than just friends

Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)
Touch me, baby (Touch me, touch me, touch me, touch me)
Touch me, baby (Naked in Manhattan)

Won't you fucking touch me?
I just want to touch you (Naked in Manhattan)
I want more than you know (Naked in Manhattan)
Oh, oh, oh (Naked in Manhattan)
Naked in Manhattan

"California"

I stretched myself across four states
New lands, west coast, where my dreams lay
I trade amber clay roads for the
Sea foam and the endless sun rays

'Cause I was never told that I wasn't gonna get
The things I want the most
But people always say, "If it hasn't happened yet
Then maybe you should go"

Come get me out of California
No leaves are brown
I miss the seasons in Missouri
My dying town
Thought I'd be cool in California
I'd make you proud
To think I almost had it going
But I let you down

Too hard, to find reasons to stay
Even true love could not persuade

'Cause I was never told that I wasn't gonna get
The things I want the most
But people always say, "If it hasn't happened yet
Then maybe you should go"

Come get me out of California
No leaves are brown
I miss the seasons in Missouri
My dying town
Thought I'd be cool in California
I'd make you proud
To think I almost had it going
But I let you down

Come get me out
Come get me out
Come get me out
Come get me out

Come get me out of California
No leaves are brown
I miss the seasons in Missouri
My dying town
Thought I'd be cool in California
I'd make you proud
To think I almost had it going
But I let you down

"Guilty Pleasure"

Learned it on the internet
Wheels turning in my head
Think back to what you said
And I turn red, I'm turning red

Wild thoughts that make me melt
A good hit below the belt
Sometimes I scare myself
But I can't help what I can't help

So shame on me and shame on you
I fantasize what we would do
And how would he taste and the way you move
Oh, some good girls do bad things too

I want this like a cigarette
Can we drag it out and never quit? And
Oh my God, you are heaven-sent
With your dirty mind, yeah, you're perverted
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure

Feels like pornography watching you try on jeans
You're a pothead, you're a cinephile
It's been awhile since you turned up the dial

So shame on me, shame on you
I fantasize what we would do
And how would it taste, the way you move
Oh, some good girls do bad things too

I want this like a cigarette
Can we drag it out and never quit? And
Oh my God, you are heaven-sent
With your dirty mind, yeah, you're perverted
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure

You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure
You give me guilty, guilty pleasure, pleasure, pleasure, pleasure...

"Bitter"

Oh God, tell me that I'm not insane
With a toy gun hanging in my mouth
I'm made of jade and I'm feeling pretty jaded
It's a problem that I'll never ever figure out

Take pills for your double black eyes
Said I pack a punch and give it to ya
Don't promise you'll do better next time
I know never to believe ya

I love being bitter
It makes me feel better
Bitter feels better than tryna get better and I
Yes, I love being bitter
But it makes me feel weathered
Now I'm sick in the head and it's not even my fault
Now I'm sick in the head and it's not even my fault

I used to laugh like the cartoon children
I wasn't always this way
Once sweet like an orange creamsicle
Or lemon icing on the cake

Bite hard when I try to be nice
I know exactly what you want
Cut clean when I twist that knife
No one falls for the villain

But I love being bitter
Yeah, it makes me feel better
Bitter feels better than tryna get better and I
Yes, I love being bitter
But it makes me feel weathered
Now I'm sick in the head and it's not even my fault
Now I'm sick in the head and it's not even my fault

I'm unaware just give me some time, I'm
Having trouble fighting wars in my mind
Take it easy, take it easy

I don't care that I'm on your shelf 'cause
I'm pretty good at talking to myself
Take it easy, take it easy

Take it easy
Take it easy
Take it easy

Yes, I love being bitter
'Cause it makes me feel better
Now I'm sick in the head and I think it's my fault
Now I'm sick in the head and I think it's my fault

"Love Me Anyway"

I love you because you have those Polaroids of me inside your nightstand
And I love you because you're understanding when I'm too shy to show my skin

Sometimes I forget, wasn't always this way
It's hard to admit, I was the one to blame

When I met you at summer camp
I would never give you the chance
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
Autumn came and December went
Turned you down at your high school dance
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway

I love you because when I say "I don't wanna talk" you always call me
And I love you because you lead me back to bed when I wander in my sleep

Sometimes I forget, wasn't always this way
It's hard to admit, I was the one to blame

When I met you at summer camp
I would never give you the chance
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
Autumn came and December went
Turned you down at your high school dance
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway

And after all this time, you were right
Can we take more Polaroids for you to hide?

When I met you at summer camp
I would never give you the chance
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
Autumn came and December went
Turned you down at your high school dance
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
You still la-love me anyway
Anyway

"School Nights"

I'm feeling childish
When you draw tattoos on my forearm
Pop bubblegum too loud
We got them preachin' that we're hell-bound

But I don't think we are unless you do

I wanna be a kid with you
Talk slow on a school night
And you can disregard my virgin ears and say what you like
You wanna win me over now?
Impress me like a school fight
And I triple-dog dare ya
To pinky-promise that you'll never lie
Ooh ooh oh

We light firecrackers in the middle of the street
You hear them yellin' at us
But you, listen to me
As I pour my voice in your soul
You say "goddamn let's never get old," and
I agree

I wanna be a kid with you
Talk slow on a school night
And you can disregard my virgin ears and say what you like
You wanna win me over now?
Impress me like a school fight
And I triple-dog dare ya
To pinky-promise that you'll never lie
Ooh ooh oh

Make me a ring out of clover flowers
Sit in a teacup, spin for hours
I'm official, I know I'm official
Got a badge to your club and
One has initials
You become King Kong
You're King Kong
You grow up so strong
You're so strong
But I wannna stay young
Yeah, I wanna stay young with you
Yeah, I wanna stay young
Yeah, I wanna stay young with you
Wanna stay young
I wanna stay young with you
Wanna stay young
I wanna stay young

I wanna be a kid with you
Talk slow on a school night
And you can disregard my virgin ears and say what you like
You want to win me over now?
Impress me like a school fight
And I triple-dog dare ya
To pinky-promise that you'll never lie
Ooh ooh oh
