"Friend"

Pictures of the old us got me feelin' older
I just thought you should know I never wanted closure
But you had no problem leavin'
Now I'm the one to feel it

I just can't believe you don't know what I'm feelin'
Guess you got the best of this
Pickin' up the pieces, you just wanna leave 'em
Killin' me a little bit
And I hate the way you love me
And I hate that I still care
Funny how you feel like we would ever talk again
How could you think I'd be your friend?

I'm sure you're doin' fine, but I don't wanna hear it
And if I left my T-shirt, you can keep it

I don't wanna see you again if it's different
'Cause I'll only see all the things that I'm missin'
And I should've cut all the ties, but I didn't
I didn't let go

I just can't believe you don't know what I'm feelin'
Guess you got the best of this (Guess you got the best of this)
Pickin' up the pieces, you just wanna leave 'em
Killin' me a little bit (Killin' me a little bit)
And I hate the way you love me
And I hate that I still care (I still care)
Funny how you feel like we would ever talk again
How could you think I'd be?

You had no problem leavin'
Now I'm the one to feel it

I just can't believe you don't know what I'm feelin'
Guess you got the best of this (Guess you got the best of this)
Pickin' up the pieces, you just wanna leave 'em
Killin' me a little bit (Killin' me a little bit)
And I hate the way you love me
And I hate that I still care (I still care)
So funny how you feel like we would ever talk again
How could you think I'd be your friend?

"21"

I missed your 21st birthday, I been up at 'em
Almost tried to call you, don't know if I should
Hate to picture you half drunk, happy
Hate to think you went out without me

I'm sorry if you blame me, if I were you I would
Thought you'd see it comin' but you never could
I still haven't heard from your family
But you said your mom always loved me

Sometimes I go blurry-eyed
Small talk and you tell me that you're on fire
Lights on and it's black and white
I couldn't stay forever

I see the look in your eye and I'm biting my tongue
You'll be the love of my life when I was young
When the night is over don't call me up
I'm already under

I get a little bit alone sometimes and I miss you again
I'll be the love of your life inside your head
When the night is over don't call me up
I'm already under

Audrey said she saw you out past twelve o'clock
Just because you're hurting doesn't mean I'm not
If it doesn't go away by the the time I turn 30
I made a mistake and I'll tell you I'm sorry (Sorry)

Sometimes I go blurry-eyed
Small talk and you tell me that you're on fire
Lights on and it's black and white
I couldn't stay forever

I see the look in your eye and I'm biting my tongue
You'll be the love of my life when I was young
When the night is over don't call me up
I'm already under

I get a little bit alone sometimes and I miss you again
I'll be the love of your life inside your head
When the night is over don't call me up
I'm already under

"Under / Over"

Funny when I think about the months
That I could not get out of bed
Going back and forth over the letters that I wrote but never sent
Wake up and repeat it
But I was barely sleeping
Swimming in the memories, I'm floating in the deep end
How come you're not still in my head?

I got, you got, we got too much time on our hands
Used to be so caught up
In the things we had planned
I'm not chasing feelings that I don't understand
I'm underwater
But I'm over you

Thought that I'd be good the day
I took down all your pictures in my room
How'd it go from easier to everything still leading back to you?

Can I be honest? I think about you constantly
You're closing every door
But now I'm looking for an opening
Maybe I'm just getting confused

I got, you got, we got too much time on our hands
Used to be so caught up
In the things we had planned
I'm still chasing feelings that I don't understand
I'm underwater
Am I over you?

"tehe"

We played grown-up
Drowned in bathtubs
But you never opened up
And I never said enough

Thunder warning
Should've called it
But we never gave it up

Now I know it wasn't right, wasn't right
We pretended to hold it
Went quiet
And we blamed it on the time
On the time
On the timing, we broke it
Went silent

Slept on floors of
Angry mornings
But you never let me in
So I stopped wanting it
Tearing every wall and
Breaking down the doors
Kept bending every rule
Till all of me was yours
And pushing things aside
But nothing ever worked
Worked

Now I know it wasn't right
Wasn't right
We pretended to hold it
Went quiet
And we blamed it on the time
On the time
On the timing, we broke it
Went silent

Tearing every wall and
Breaking down the doors
Kept bending every rule
Till all of me was yours
And pushing things aside
But nothing ever worked
Worked

Now I know it wasn't right
Wasn't right
We pretended to hold it
Went quiet
And we blamed it on the time
On the time
On the timing, we broke it
Went silent

"I Miss You, I'm Sorry"

Do you remember
Happy together?
I do
Don't you?

Then all of a sudden
You're sick to your stomach
Is that
Still true?

Said forever, in the end, I fought it
Please be honest, are we better for it?
Thought you'd hate me but instead you called and
Said, "I miss you," I caught it

Good to each other
Give it the summer
I knew
You too

But I only saw you
Once in December
I'm still
Confused

You said forever and I almost bought it
I miss fighting in your old apartment
Breaking dishes when you're disappointed
I still love you, I promise

Nothing happened in the way I wanted
Every corner of this house is haunted
And I know you said that we're not talking
But I miss you, I'm sorry

I don't wanna go
Think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us

I don't wanna go
We been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you

I don't wanna go
Think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us

I don't wanna go
We been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you

I don't wanna go
Think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us

I don't wanna go
We been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you

I don't wanna go
Think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us

I don't wanna go
We been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you

"Long Sleeves"

Packing while you're asleep
You were the catalyst
I don't know what it is about how you breathe
About how you breathe

I want to be alone
Hate it that no one knows, you're good to everyone
All them but me
All them but me

And if you hear me leaving in the morning
Could you just pretend that it was only wind?

'Cause I can't love you even if I want to
Got a lot to work through
You don't know where I've been

It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming

Say something sweet to me
It never meant a thing
Used to the turbulence
I wore long sleeves
I wore long sleeves

Fought till you tethered me
Swept under surfaces
Never enough of it
You didn't think
You didn't think

If you hear me leaving in the morning
Could you please pretend that it was only wind?

'Cause I can't love you even if I want to
Got a lot to work through
You don't know where I've been

It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming

Coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down

Coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming

Coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down, I'm coming down
I'm coming down, I'm coming down

"minor"

Hit me 310
And I'll be home at some point
Past sundown, because traffic
You already know that, oh
I'll put on a show
If you just come over
I'm sorry your house is in Glendale
Or somewhere far

I would drive all night to get to you
But my curfew is early and mom's up at home
I would run for miles to get to you
But you gotta understand, I can't 'cause

M-I-N-O-R
I'm minorly stuck
And it's not your fault
Just how things are
M-I-N-O-R
I'm all out of luck
I'm minorly stuck, oh

Hit me 310
We'll meet by the freeway
It's shady, but better than nothing
Oh, take my word
I grew up not far, but never been down here
At this time
Your house is in Glendale
Or somewhere far

I would drive all night to get to you
But my curfew is early and dad's at the door
I would run for miles to get to you
But you gotta understand, I can't 'cause

M-I-N-O-R
I'm minorly stuck
And it's not your fault
Just how things are
M-I-N-O-R
I'm all out of luck
I'm minorly stuck

M-I-N-O-R
I'm minorly stuck
And it's not your fault
Just how things are
M-I-N-O-R
I'm all out of luck
I'm minorly stuck

"Feels Like"

Oh
We almost got away, we cut it close
The city's getting loud, if I choke
It's only 'cause I'm scared to be alone
Been trying to work it out, you should know

I would do whatever you wanted
We don't have to leave the apartment
Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like

Living in a movie I've watched and
Funny 'cause I couldn't have called it
Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like

Oh
The train was cold, we left Connecticut
We stayed a couple hours, our clothes
Matched enough to throw me off a bit
Your phone was playing Towers, and I

I would do whatever you wanted
We don't have to leave the apartment
Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like

Living in a movie I've watched and
Funny 'cause I couldn't have called it
Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like

And I need you sometimes
We'll be alright

Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like

And I miss you some nights
We'll be alright

Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like

I would do whatever you wanted
We don't have to leave the apartment
Met you at the right time
This is what it feels like

"Rockland"

Hey
I feel like I might say the wrong thing
I hung up when I started calling
You probably would've laughed then
If you had seen it happen

Hey
Who took my place in bed when I left?
Who laughs at everything that you've said?
I'm sure that I would like her
If I were slightly nicer

Bet you
Wish you
Never even met me
I don't
Blame you
Broke your every heartbeat

Hey
I parked across the street from your house
The lights were on the music got loud
I doubt you would've seen me
I hid from everybody

Hey
I feel like if we gave it one night
You'd hate me less and make it alright
Just wish that we could fight now
I'd hold you on the comedown

Bet you
Wish you
Never even met me
I don't
Blame you
Broke your every heartbeat

Bet you
Wish you
Never even met me
I can't
Blame you
Broke your every heartbeat

I see you every night in my sleep
Anticipating every bad dream
Like falling with a knife you cut deep
You cut deep
You cut deep

I see you every night in my sleep
Anticipating every bad dream
Like falling with a knife you cut deep
You cut deep

Bet you
Wish you
Never even met me
I don't
Blame you
Broke your every heartbeat

Bet you
Wish you
Never even met me
I can't
Blame you
Broke your every heartbeat

I see you every night in my sleep
Anticipating every bad dream
Like falling with a knife you cut deep
You cut deep
You cut deep

I see you every night in my sleep
Anticipating every bad dream
Like falling with a knife you cut deep
You cut deep
You cut deep

"For Real This Time"

I think that maybe I was right
Back when I knew to draw the line
Already gave what I could offer
Maybe we'll work another time

I guess the thought of it's enough
No going back or switching up
I really wish that I could do that
Walking away from you is tough

I know we've run it dry
I've heard that happens sometimes
I shouldn't be surprised
Should I?

I've packed my bags in the middle of the night
A thousand times I got up to say goodbye
I could be wrong but I think that I'm for real this time

I've taken down all the pictures in my room
I've hidden things that reminded me of you
I know I've lied but I think that I'm for real this time

Couldn't you tell when I was off
You never asked me what it was
I kind of hope you feel the same way
So that I'm not the only one

Who thinks we've run it dry
But still we've stayed a long time
I'm sorry if I make you cry tonight

'Cause I've packed my bags in the middle of the night
A thousand times I got up to say goodbye
I could be wrong but I think that I'm for real this time

I've taken down all the pictures in my room
I've hidden things that reminded me of you
I know I've lied but I think that I'm for real this time

I know that I've lied
But we're running dry
Know I won't come back this time

I know that I've lied
But we're running dry
Think that I'm for real this time

I've packed my bags in the middle of the night
A thousand times I got up to say goodbye
I could be wrong but I think that I'm for real this time

"Camden"

I never said it but I know that I
Can't picture anything past twenty-five
Not like I care to know the timing
Not like I'm looking for that silence
Self-diagnosing 'til I'm borderline
I'll do whatever helps to sleep at night
Until I'm feeling like an island
Until I'm strong enough to hide it
What was I thinking looking for a sign?
As if I've ever seen the stars align
Somebody take over the driving
Somebody notice how I'm trying

Somebody notice how I'm trying

When I'm toeing that line
All of the time
Calling it fine
Calling it fine
Toeing that line
All of the time
Calling it fine
Calling it fine

How do you call it when
You're in your head?
Like when you're really keep inside of it
I only talk into the mirror
I'm only scared of getting bigger
At least I'll never turn to cigarettes
My brother shielded me from all of that
He said that smoking was a killer
He said he knows that I've been bitter
Maybe I'm waiting for the go ahead
The validation that I never get
Most of the game is unfamiliar
Most of the girls are getting thinner

When I'm toeing that line
All of the time
Calling it fine
Calling it fine
Toeing that line
All of the time
Calling it fine
Calling it fine

All of me, a wound to close
But I leave the whole thing open
I just wanted you to know
I was never good at coping
All of me, a wound to close
But I leave the whole thing open
I just wanted you to know
I was never good at coping
All of me, a wound to close
But I leave the whole thing open
I just wanted you to know
I was never good at coping
All of me, a wound to close
But I leave the whole thing open
I just wanted you to know
I was never good at coping

I never said it but I know that I
Can't picture anything past twenty-five
Not like I care to know the timing
Not like I'm looking for that silence
I never said it but I know that I
I bury baggage 'til it's out of sight
I think it's better if I hide it
I really hope that I'll survive this

"The Bottom"

I told you I was down bad
You hate to see my like that
I don't know how you look passed
My stupid fucking setbacks

When you opened up the door
You let me in when you should have your guard up
What a painful back and forth
Oh

It's hard to ignore all of my problems
Gonna regret being too honest
Calling it love but this isn't falling
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom

'Cause I'm no good
You could do better
You should walk out
It's now or never
I took the most that you could offer
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom

I told you I was down bad
You could never fix that
I'm happier when I'm sad
So leave and never come back

When you opened up the door
You let me in when you should have your guard up
What a painful back and forth
Oh

It's hard to ignore all of my problems
Gonna regret being too honest
Calling it love but this isn't falling
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom

'Cause I'm no good
You could do better
You should walk out
It's now or never
I took the most that you could offer
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom

Watch me drag you down
No saving you now
Watch me drag you down
There's no getting out
Watch me drag you down
No saving you now
Watch me drag you down

It's hard to ignore all of my problems
Gonna regret being too honest
Calling it love but this isn't falling
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom

'Cause I'm no good
You could do better
You should walk out
It's now or never
I took the most that you could offer
I'm gonna drag you right down to the bottom

"Wishful Thinking"

Meet you down at the bottom
Finish a bottle
You know I know all your problems now

Flaked on me back in August
And if I'm honest
You've gotten harder to figure out

I know that you got everything you wanted
I heard a rumor everybody's talking
About you now

I really thought that I could fix this
But nothing's different
How come I'm stuck on thinking you'd grow up?
I really hoped that we'd be passed this
Problems past tense
Is it just wishful thinking that you'd grow up?

Dropped it all in a second
After your message
Do you remember me calling out?

Meet you back in the wreckage
Right where you left it
Do you regret how I see you now?

You said that you got better you saw me
I heard a rumor
It's medicine and molly
You're blacking out

I really thought that I could fix this
But nothing's different
How come I'm stuck on thinking you'd grow up?
I really hoped that we'd be passed this
Problems past tense
Is it just wishful thinking that you'd grow up?

"Older"

Pinch me now
You're caught in my crossfire
Fell into my arms but they got tired
We were so good, weren't we?
Till it just stopped working

Almost like we tore out the same page and
Left a lot of room for new mistakes
You never quite let me in
When you felt cracks again

I stopped waving a flag
I just dropped all caring for that
I went quiet
And you went cold
Guess that happened
When we got older

Humor me
Could taking a break be the better thing?
Just letting each other breathe
Won't you just look at me?
Or am I too draining?

You spent hours awake holding back
I know I'm to blame for the small talk and tip toeing over
Guess that happened when we got older

You spent hours awake holding back
I know I'm to blame for the small talk and tip toeing over
Guess that happened when we got older

"Better"

Don't feel it all
Talk slow and leveled
Foot off the pedal
Same shirt and perfume on

The two of us were accidental
But so good together
Now all I feel is

So bad about it
I barely left my bed
We talk around it
All for nothing

So if that's all it was
If you're good giving in, giving up
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now
And if that's what you want
If you don't wanna see me at all now
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now

It's been a while
Old clothes fit larger
You're looking smaller
What happened when I left

I'm still sad about it
You've barely left my head
We talk around it
All for nothing

So if that's all it was
If you're good giving in, giving up
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now
And if that's what you want
If you don't wanna see me at all now
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now

I'd turn the car round if you'd let me
If you let me, you let me
You know I'd cry my eyes out till I'm empty
Till I'm empty, I'm empty

So if that's all it was
If you're good giving in, giving up
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now
And if that's what you want
If you don't wanna see me at all now
So if that's all it was
Hope you feel better now

Hope you feel better now
Hope you feel better

"Hard To Sleep"

I only thought it for a minute but it got me down
That kind of feeling when you've got something to cry about
And all the talking turned to screaming that I couldn't help
This isn't me, me, me
I only thought it for a moment but it's crippling
I guess the gravity have growing out of sinking in
What if I'm missing the capacity for all of it
This isn't me, me, me

And I'm so scared of losin' all control
Don't you tell me it's better to let go
When the weight of the world feels so close
It's only me, me, me

Audrey told me that she thinks I might be in my head
How I'm overthinking everything I never said?
How it's killing me a little to be different, oh?
It isn't me, me, me

But I'm so scared of losin' all control
Don't you tell me it's better to let go
When the weight of the world feels so close
It's only me, me, me

Hard to sleep, could it be
Only me, only me?
Hard to sleep, could it be
Only me, only me?
Hard to sleep, could it be
Only me, only me?
Hard to sleep, could it be
Only me, only me?
Mm-mm, mm-hmm

I'm so scared of losin' all control
When they tell me it's better to let go
When the weight of the world feels so close
It's only me, me, me
And I'm so scared of losin' all control
When they tell me it's better to let go
When the weight of the world is so close
It's only me (Me), me (Me), me
It's only me, me, me

"Augusta"

Feel like maybe I might go to Boston
Cut my hair in the way that I've wanted
Change my number and bury my wallet
California makes me exhausted

I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost

Heard a poem about mid October
How the leaves in the fall feel like closure
About a girl that the guy wasn't over
Think that I might relate when I'm older

I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost

Tough I don't know a lot that could hurt me
Learned the hard way to forget my body
Till you're walking around like a zombie
Still don't know how to talk through that story

I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost

"Painkillers"

I almost liked the way you fooled me
To make me feel like this would last forever
But twice a night, I'd wake up sweating
To sleep without you here would do me better

I-I, I-I
Called you out and labeled you a problem
I-I, I-I
I should know that it takes one to know one

You represent the codependence
I was down, you wore the shining armor
The side-effect is cold resentment
Tricked me into thinking you were stronger

I-I, I-I
Called you out and knew you were my problem
I-I, I-I
I should know that it takes one to know one

Hold me slowly
You don't even know me
Home now, lights out
Pictures just destroy me
Come through late, and
Tell me that you want it bad
Hold me slowly
You don't even know me
Home now, lights out
Pictures just destroy me
Come through late, and
Tell me that you want it bad

"Alright"

I still avoid medication
I'd rather take a vacation
Drive around all of the outlets
Buy things and later regret it
Spend the whole week in Hawaii
Fall asleep under the palm trees
Down a whole bottle of whiskey
Countin' the people who hate me

I don't know if I'll be alright
What will it take to make this good?
Oh, someone tell me it gets better
Better, better, better
Because for tonight, I'm just not alright

What if I drove to you backwards?
Jump in the shallow end headfirst
Burn my emergency contact
Run for the hills when it gets bad
What if I never move out?
I'd live in the basement my whole life
I got the chills when I said that
I never thought of a fallback

I don't know if I'll be alright (Alright)
What will it take to make this good?
Oh, someone tell me it gets better
Better, better, better
Because for tonight, I'm just not alright

"Best"

I was bored out my mind
Lost my whole appetite
When I could come to life, I didn't
You were there all the time
You're the worst of my crimes
You fell hard
I thought good riddance

I never was the best to you
I never was the best to you
I never was
I never was

Used to lie to your face
Twenty times in a day
It was my little strange addiction
But you still tried to stay
While I'd self isolate
And I knew but I stayed hidden

I never was the best to you
I never was the best to you
I never was
I never was
I never was the best to you
I never was the best to you
I never was
I never was

And I destroyed every silver lining you had in your head
All of your feelings, I played with them
Go ahead, we can just call it conditioning
We were too different
You were so sensitive
Gave me the best of that, I was so negligent
Now I feel terrible about how I handled it

And now I
Now I bet you resent all of me, all of it
Angry, blocking me over the internet
Promise, I don't forget all of my fault in this
'Cause look at me, I'm alone, sitting here, staying home
All of my self control kinda got difficult
But I deserve it though
But I deserve it though

You were there all the time
You're the worst of my crimes
You fell hard
I thought good riddance

I never was the best to you
I never was the best to you
I never was
I never was
Oh, I never was the best to you
I never was the best to you
I never was
I never was

"I Know It Won't Work"

I left you here
Heard you keep the extra closet empty
In case this year
I come back and stay throughout my twenties
What if I won't?
How am I supposed to put that gently?
And down the road
You will love me until you resent me

I've had the thought
Tried to work it out through anxious pacing
What if I'm not
Worth the time and breath I know you're saving?
But it's a lot
All the shine of half a decade fading
The whole facade
Seemed to fall apart, it's complicated

And part of me wants to walk away till you really listen
I hate to look at your face and know that we're feeling different
'Cause part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh?
Why won't you try moving on for once? That might make it easy
I know we cut all the ties but you're never really leaving
And part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh?

I know it won't work like that

I'll open up
I'm thinking everything you wish I wasn't
The call was tough
But you're better off, I'm being honest
So won't you stop
Holding out for me when I don't want it
Just brush me off
'Cause I'm your ghost right now, your house is haunted

And part of me wants to walk away till you really listen
I hate to look at your face and know that we're feeling different
'Cause part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh?
Why won't you try moving on for once? That might make it easy
I know we cut all the ties but you're never really leaving
And part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh?

I know it won't work like that, huh?
I know it won't work like that, huh?

"Full Machine"

I'm a rollercoaster
You're a dead end street
But won't you stay for a while
I wish that you'd never leave

I know I know better
You're no guarantee
But if you asked me to run away
I'd go easily

I almost lost it
I'll heal eventually
But faster if you're next to me
Next to me
I'm codependent
But trying hard not to be
I'm better when you're next to me

I'm a shameless caller
You're a full machine
But won't you answer tonight
And say something nice to me
And you don't have to mean it

You can lie to me
But if you asked me to run away
I'd go easily

I almost lost it
I'll heal eventually
But faster if you're next to me
Next to me
I'm codependent
But trying hard not to be
I'm better when you're next to me, next to me

But do you think we could talk?
'Cause I've been trying to tell you
How you're the one that I turn to

But I should probably stop
Instead of forcing a break through
It's just that I'll always choose you

I'm a forest fire
You're the kerosene
I had a life here before you
But now it's burning

I know I know better and
You're ignoring me
Still if you asked me to run away
I'd go easily

I almost lost it
I'll heal eventually
But faster if you're next to me
Next to me
I'm codependent
But I'm trying hard not to be
I'm better when you're next to me, next to me

Do you think we could talk?
'Cause I've been trying to tell you
How you're the one that I turn to (Turn to)

But I should probably stop
Instead of forcing a break through
It's just that I'll always choose you

"Where Do We Go Now?"

24th street
Where you held me, grabbed my arm
What a mental fire alarm
'Cause a lot of that felt wrong
Like I miss you
But when I kissed you back I lied
You don't know how hard I tried
Had to fake the longest time

Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?

You look hopeful
Like we're supposed to work somehow
Can't you tell our light burned out
Got a lot to cry about
There's nothing left here
All our best years are behind
What a brutal way to die
But you choose it every time

So, where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?

We could meet down the line
After all of the time and
Give an actual try
I can't promise you'll like it
I know I changed overnight
So I can't blame you for fighting
And I'd be losing my mind
If you lived in your writing

'Cause
Now I'm half of myself here without you
You're the best in my life and I lost you
And we had no control when it fell through
It was one-sided hate how I hurt you
If I could I'd have changed every feeling
Reservations were up to the ceiling
Guess the space was the thing that I needed
But I miss you

Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?

"I Should Hate You"

Last night, I spiralled alone in the kitchen
Making pretend that the furniture listened
Wasn't the best of my mental conditions, but I tried
Thinkin' of you without any forgiveness

Because I was the one who would stay up and call you
And I'd drive to your house for the shit that you went through
Then I wasted my breath when I tried to console you, didn't I?
'Cause we didn't happen the way we were supposed to

I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you

Pulled the knife out my back, it was right where you left it
But your aim's kinda perfect, I'll give you the credit
I just drank something strong to try to forget, but it wasn't right
No, you're not even here, but you're doin' my head in

I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
Ooh, ooh

I should hate you, I feel stupid
Like I almost crashed my car
Drivin' home to talk about you
At my table in the dark
All I ever think about is
Where the hell you even are
And I swear to God I'd kill you
If I loved you less hard

After all of this time, I still get disappointed
Bet you're doing alright and you don't even know it
How it's all 'cause of you that my standards are broken in my mind
I would bend back to you if you left the door open

I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
Ooh, ooh
I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
I know that I should hate you
Ooh, ooh

"Will You Cry?"

When you talk you get shallow
Where I walk you don't follow
When I scream you're my echo
Will you cry if I let go?

Damage
Lined up
Wreckage left behind us
How'd we get stuck?
Now I'm what you're bored of

Now you walk through me
With my heart heavy
Breaking my reverie
I could die early
With your arms 'round me
Habits go slowly
Would it not kill to say goodbye?

When you talk you get shallow
Where I walk you don't follow
When I scream you're my echo
Will you cry if I let go?

Pieces broken
All we left unspoken
Aimless hoping
Left my mouth wide open

It's kinda funny when it goes from all to nothing
You have to laugh before you start to cry
'Cause now I stop myself from holding on to something
That makes me feel a little less alive

When you talk you get shallow
Where I walk you don't follow
When I scream you're my echo
Will you cry if I let go?

You don't move me
I see through you
I don't follow
I don't want to

You don't move me
I see through you
I don't follow
I don't want to

You don't move me
I see through you
I don't follow
I don't want to

You don't move me
I see through you
I don't follow
I don't want to

Now you walk through me
With my heart heavy
Breaking my reverie
I could die early
With your arms 'round me
Habits go slowly
Would it not kill to say goodbye?

When you talk you get shallow
Where I walk you don't follow
When I scream you're my echo
Will you cry if I let go?

When you talk you get shallow
Where I walk you don't follow
When I scream you're my echo
Will you cry if I let go?

Will you cry if I let go?

Will you cry if I let go?

Will you cry if I let go?

Will you cry if I let go?

"Amelie"

I met a girl once
She sort of ripped me open
She doesn't even know it
She doesn't know my name
We sat on the sofa
She asked me a million questions
I answered and by eleven
Memorized her face

Where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie?
Where'd you go?
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie?
I don't know

Why'd it feel louder
When all of it went unspoken?
All I can do is hope that
This will go away
She had her hair up
She cried about her obsessions
But she doesn't know I'd let her
Ruin all my days

Where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie?
Where'd you go?
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie?
I don't know
Where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie?
Where'd you go?
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie?
Tell me no

Tell me more, I would give all my time
All your words felt like a nursery rhyme
Comfortable, handing you my whole life
When all your words felt like a funeral rite

So where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie?
Where'd you go?
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie?
I don't know, oh
Where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie?
Where'd you go?
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie?
I don't know

So where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie?
Where'd you go?
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie?
I don't know, oh
Where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie?
Where'd you go?
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie?
Tell me no

"Difficult"

My double vision
Is only amplifying everything he isn't
Till I feel less attached and bored to death but listen
It's no one's fault, it's just my terrible condition

And I've been thinking if I move out this year
I'll feel my parents slipping
Away and also I'm just scared of that commitment
I really think sometimes there's something that I'm missing

Oh I know spiraling is miserable
I should probably go back home
Why does that feel difficult, difficult?
Oh I hope I wake up invisible
I'd be someone no one knows
I guess I'm just difficult

To name this feeling
Would take a hundred thousand years, some kind of grieving
But over what I never had, so I've been speaking
To my therapist, I call her every weekend

I meant to tell you
How I've hated how we left things when it fell through
'Cause you were everything to me, where did you run to?
Was it something that I said that colored you blue?

Oh I know spiraling is miserable
I should probably go back home
Why does that feel difficult, difficult?
Oh I hope I wake up invisible
I'd be someone no one knows
I guess I'm just difficult, difficult

Difficult
Difficult

I've been drinking
And staying up too late reliving bad decisions
I thought eventually my ranting here would fix it
I really think sometimes there's something that I'm missing

Oh I know spiraling is miserable
I should probably go back home
Why does that feel difficult, difficult?
Oh I hope I wake up invisible
I'd be someone no one knows
I guess I'm just difficult, difficult

Oh I know spiraling is miserable
I should probably go back home
Why does that feel difficult, difficult?
Oh I hope I wake up invisible
I'd be someone no one knows
I guess I'm just difficult, difficult

"This Is What The Drugs Are For"

This is what the drugs are for
Turn the lights off on the come down
I still get emotional
When I think about your old house

Hopefully, the high
Works to change my mind

Now, I feel you in my room
Haven't seen you in a lifetime
What am I supposed to do
When you used to be my lifeline?

I've counted all the days
Since you walked away

Look now I'm alone again
I've gotten used to sleeping here without you
Though I've tried I can't pretend
That I don't sit around and think about you
When all I ever do is think about you

In the middle of the night
I got caught inside a fever
Almost called a hundred times
Just to ask if you might leave her

She appears in dreams
Chasing after me

Look now I'm alone again
I've gotten used to sleeping here without you
Though I've tried I can't pretend
That I don't sit around and think about you

Look how I just lost a friend
I'm burying your things inside my bedroom
All distractions in the end
Don't work, I'm left to sit and think about you
Like all I ever do is think about you

I'm still waiting by the phone
You painted my life indigo
A kind of blue I hate to know
Where everything turns kind of cold

Look now I'm alone again
I've gotten used to sleeping here without you
Though I've tried I can't pretend
That I don't sit around and think about you

Look how I just lost a friend
I'm burying your things inside my bedroom
All distractions in the end
Don't work, I'm left to sit and think about you
Like all I ever do is think about you

"Fault Line"

You could go, and I won't even feel it
Wouldn't hold up the road when you're leaving
You're a bad holiday
You're the drug that I take
When I want to forget how I'm feeling

I know you're a fault line
But I'll break too
Cracking at the same time
Does it shock you?

When I'm down
I fall right back to you, it happens
I know you're a fault line
But I'll break too
I'll break too

You could go, and I bet I'd recover
Overnight, finish hurting each other
You feel light years away
If I met you today
I would run to the arms of another

I know you're a fault line
But I'll break too
Cracking at the same time
Does it shock you?

When I'm down
I fall back in to you, it happens
I know you're a fault line
But I'll break too
I'll break too

And all my imaginary friends are scared of you
I've gone and cried to them in our bedroom
Most nights I will pretend
I left this sooner

But I know you're a fault line
But I'll break too
Cracking at the same time
Does it shock you?

When I'm down
I fall back in to you, it happens
I know you're a fault line
But I'll break too

I'll break too
I'll break too
I'd break too

"The Blue"

You live in Hollywood
You're half an hour from me
Your reputation's good
I hope we've got a lot in common

I kinda think you should
Just drop it all and call me
You'd tell me on the phone
You really want to meet my family

What are you doing to me now?
What are you doing to me now?

You'd talk about your dad
He used to get so angry
He'd scare you and your brother
Till you felt you needed saving

I know I'd let you in
On all my bad decisions
You'd make them feel less terrible
The second that you'd listen

What are you doing to me now?
What are you doing to me now?

You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted

You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted

I wonder if you know
If you can tell I'm losing
I'm going down without a fight
I don't know how you do it

You say we share a brain
Apologizing for it
But I take it as a compliment
You make me really nervous

What are you doing to me now?
What are you doing to me now?

You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted

You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted

What are you doing to me now?
What are you doing to me?
What are you doing to me now?
Mmm, mmm

Send me every song
That keeps you up from sleeping
I bet I could recite 'em all
I won't forget the feeling

Of staying up with you
Despite the space between us
I've never felt this close to someone
What if you're my weakness?

You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted

You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted

You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted

You came out of the blue like that
You came out of the blue like that
I never could've seen you coming
I think you're everything I've wanted

"Right Now"

Look at me, I feel homesick
Want my dog in the door
And the light in the kitchen
From the fridge, on the floor
And the faint overhearing
Of my mom on the phone
Through the walls of my bedroom
Things that I shouldn't know

Think the bus might be broken
'Cause the shocks never work
We're collectively hoping
That the drive will be short

People 24/7
It's the best and a curse
All they do is remind me
That I'm still introverted

I'm so high, but can't look down
Left my past life on the ground
Think I'm more alive somehow
I feel like myself right now

Pretty far from the ocean
Never thought that would hurt
Every lake here is frozen
Which is making it worse

This is somebody's hometown
Never been here before
Writing down every street sign
Missed the spelling, I'm sure

And I ended a friendship
On the day that I left
And though I really meant it
It still makes me upset

Am I losing my family
Every minute I'm gone?
What if my little brother
Thinks my leaving was wrong?

Oh, oh, I'm so high, but can't look down
Left my past life on the ground
Think I'm more alive somehow
I feel like myself right now

I'm so tired, but can't sit down
What if this is it for now?
Think I'm more alive somehow
I feel like myself right now

I feel like myself right now
I feel like myself right now
I feel like myself right now
Mmmm

"Block Me Out"

I'll say whatever you want, but I've become such a liar
I used to follow my gut, but now I'm just getting higher
It's been a couple of months since I turned to something violent
I should be happier now, so why do I feel this quiet?

Now I only let me down
When there's no one else around
I've been thinking way too loud
I wish that I could block me out

I wish that I could block me out
Out

I think I'm burning alive, but nobody sees the fire
'Cause when I open my mouth, I seem to be stuck in silence
I thought of leaving tonight, but I couldn't drive this tired
Plus after all of this time, I should be a pretty crier

And now I only let me down
When there's no one else around
I've been thinking way too loud
I wish that I could block me out
Don't know how they see me now
Feeling lost in every crowd
I feel ten feet off the ground
I wish that I could block me out

And in my head, I make a mess of it
I'm getting tired of feeling delicate
I look around, to find it desolate
I used to try, but nothing's helping it
And in my head, I make a mess of it
I'm getting tired of feeling delicate
I look around, to find it desolate
I used to try, but nothing's helping it

Wish I were heavier now I'm floating outside my body
It's not their fault, but I've found that none of my friends will call me
Until I'm left to myself, it's honestly kind of funny
How every voice in my head is trying its best to haunt me

'Cause now I only let me down
When there's no one else around
I've been thinking way too loud
I wish that I could block me out
Don't know how they see me now
Feeling lost in every crowd
I feel ten feet off the ground
I wish that I could block me out
Out

I wish that I could block me out
I wish that I could block me out

"Unsteady"

Hiding
I kinda feel like an island
I should go home
But I'm fighting that right now
People freak me out
And I panic
I should be cool but I panic
Out of the blue
And I end up on the ground
Weaker all around

But it's so hard
When it feels like my fault
When I keep 'em so far
Happens when I go dark
I'm so unsteady
It's so hard
When it feels like my fault
When I keep 'em so far
Happens when I go dark
I'm so unsteady

Deeper
Words seem to cut so much deeper
Right to the bone
And I let 'em break me down
Someone pull me out right now
And I'm in danger
The girl in the mirror is a stranger
At all of the parties
I talk but there's no sound
Violet shrinking down

And it's so hard
When it feels like my fault
When I keep 'em so far
Happens when I go dark
I'm so unsteady
It's so hard
When it feels like my fault
When I keep 'em so far
Happens when I go dark
I'm so unsteady

Lately I've been staring at the ceiling
It's a sort of funny quiet feeling
Lately I don't know what to believe in
None of this is changing with the seasons

Hiding
I kinda feel like an island
I should go home
But I'm fighting that right now
People freak me out

But it's so hard
When it feels like my fault
When I keep 'em so far
Happens when I get dark
I'm so unsteady
It's so hard
When it feels like my fault
When I keep 'em so far
Happens when I go dark
I'm so unsteady

I'm so unsteady
I'm so unsteady
I'm so un-
I'm so unsteady

"405"

I, I took the 405
I drove 100 miles an hour to forget you
And I blew through the traffic light
If I were to go tonight, I think I would regret you

You took the half of me that I needed
And how'd you walk away so easy?
It's almost like you like to let me down
You took half of me, could you leave it
And go back to when we were speaking?
I hate the fact that I miss you around

Please, you won't even look at me
It's getting embarrassing, I'm crying to my family
And now I'm, I'm harder to recognize 'cause
I cut all my hair last night while you think of me barely

You took the half of me that I needed
And how'd you walk away so easy?
It's almost like you like to let me down
You took the half of me, could you leave it
And go back to when we were speaking?
I hate the fact that I miss you around

Tell me why
How the hell I slipped your mind
You forgot me overnight
Didn't even try to hide it
All the while, lost my head and appetite
You've consumed, like, all my nights
Now I know it's unrequited

'Cause I, I took the 405
I drove 100 miles an hour to forget you

You took the half of me that I needed
And how'd you walk away so easy?
It's almost like you like to let me down, down
You took half of me, could you leave it
And go back to when we were speaking?
I hate the fact that I miss you around

"Two People"

Turn around, why are you talking so slowly
Why's it feel like you don't even know me?
How are you looking at me like a stranger?
I'm the radar for every deal breaker

I loved you so hard for a time
I've tried to ration it out all my life
We could go yellow to black overnight
I take you for granted because you are mine

Don't know what to say
Two people can change
Don't think we're above
Might happen to us
Oh, isn't it strange?
We'll die anyway
Don't think we're above
Might happen to us
Mmm

Now to make sense of half of a decade
Feels like walking alone on the freeway
'Cause you know everything that could kill me
And you know, you know every inch of my body

I loved you so hard for a time
So why am I clawing you to survive?
Hate how we touch just to push things aside
When you take me for granted, I make it alright

Don't know what to say
Two people can change
Don't think we're above
Might happen to us
Oh, isn't it strange?
We'll die anyway
Don't think we're above
Might happen to us

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm

Don't know what to say
Two people can change
Don't think we're above
Might happen to us
Isn't it strange?
We'll die anyway
Don't think we're above
Might happen to us
Mmm

"Abby (Demo)"

Climb up the ivy, come through the window
Hide from your family, here with your face close
Tell on your brother, how he's been so cold
I'll make you dinner, put on your headphones
Tune out the bad news, letters from college
You miss your best friend, she should be calling
Just fall asleep right here on the carpet
I'd never wake you, stay 'til the morning light

I'm right here, fall to me, to me
Fill your head with sweet dreams, sweet dreams
You'd never hurt a thing, nothing
I hope you know to talk to me

When we were little, we shared a haircut
Wanted to kill you, I was embarrassed
Mothers insisted that we would grow up
And things would be different 'cause we would be closer
Tell me your secrets, ask every question
My door is open 24/7
Think you were made from something in heaven
You made me love the number 11

I'm right here, fall to me, to me
Fill your head with sweet dreams, sweet dreams
You'd never hurt a thing, nothing
I hope you know to talk to me

I was just thinking, do you remember
Going to New York back in November?
Swallowing chocolate, sharing a king bed
Judging an album, judging my boyfriend
Isn't it funny, we're getting older
You used to fit right up on my shoulders
I can't believe our childhood is over
I'm really grateful I get to know you

I'm right here, fall to me, to me
Fill your head with sweet dreams, sweet dreams
You'd never hurt a thing, nothing
I hope you know to talk to me

I'm right here, fall to me, to me
Fill your head with sweet dreams, sweet dreams
You'd never hurt a thing, nothing
I hope you know to talk to me

"Brush Fire"

Started as a simple lie
Thinking love had chose us
We would talk into the night
And nobody noticed

And I held on to every word
Couldn't let you go and called it hope
Now I'm so low, I can't ignore
We only ever made it worse

Then we become a brush fire, burning all the pain
How can we survive a desert without rain?
And all along your promise is that you're changing
Boy, you know what to say before I turn away
Your words hit me like a hard rain in LA

Scared to turn and look behind
Think I'd see you hurting
And even when I close my eyes
I feel like the burden

But I'm not yours anymore
Everything you broke is ash and smoke now
I'm so low, I can't ignore
We only ever made it worse

Then we become a brush fire, burning all the pain
How can we survive a desert without rain?
And all along your promise is that you're changing
Boy, you know what to say before I turn away
Your words hit me like a hard rain in LA

Then we become a brush fire, burning all the pain
How can we survive a desert without rain?
And all along your promise is that you're changing
Boy, you know what to say before I turn away
Your words hit me like a hard rain in LA

"Cedar"
(from "The Buccaneers: Season 1" soundtrack)

It's been good to know ya
This goodbye felt worst of all
No defining closure
No instruction manual
If you thought to call me
I would answer every time
Breaking up is funny
I forget you aren't mine

I forget you aren't mine
I forget you aren't mine
I forget you aren't mine

It's impossible to acclimate
Every time we talk, we understate
Oh, I know we both could die
We both could die
But you told me that you felt the same
When I told you how I needed space
But I think it was a lie
It was a lie

It's been tough to leave you
Every empty Sunday night
You come back in pieces
Every detail amplified
If you think to write me
It'll go internalized
Breaking up is funny
I forget you aren't mine

I forget you aren't mine

It's impossible to acclimate
Every time we talk, we understate
Oh, I know we both could die
We both could die
But you told me that you felt the same
When I told you how I needed space
But I think it was a lie
It was a lie

And it's wild how it dissipates
How you're further from me every day
This could be the worst goodbye
The worst goodbye
I don't even know what's left to say
'Cause we called it back then anyway
Could you just remind me why?
Remind me why

It's been weird to miss you
Hits me at the strangest times
Seven years would cut through
Other people like a knife
If I tried to meet you
Couldn't look you in the eye
Breaking up is funny
I forget you aren't mine

I forget you aren't mine

"Delusional"

Look at me now
Said I wouldn't do it, but I hunted you down
Know you had a girl, but it didn't work out
Know you bought a house, but you had to move out
I'm not proud, 'cause I'm just scared of you shootin' it down
You can just talk and I'll stare at your mouth
It could be bad, but I won't find out

And I wake up, in the middle of the night
With the light on
I feel like I could die
'Cause you're not here
And it don't feel right
'Cause you're not here

God, I'm actually invested
Haven't even met him
Watch this be the wrong thing, classic
God, I'm jumping in the deep end
It's more fun to swim, and
Heard the risk is drowning, but I'm gonna take it
I'm gonna take it
Oh whoa, oh whoa

Isn't it fun thinkin' I'm right when I'm probably wrong?
Holding my breath, livin' in slowmo
Knowing damn well that I haven't been touched by you
Behind you in the club, you're coming to me
You get to my door, and you can't even speak
But I think that it's sweet, yeah I think that you're sweet

And I wake up, in the middle of the night
With the light on
And you're not here

God, I'm actually invested
Haven't even met him
Watch this be the wrong thing, classic
God, I'm
Jumpin' in the deep end
It's more fun to swim and
Heard the risk is drowning, but I'm gonna take it

I'm gonna bend 'til I break and
You'll be my favorite mistake
I wish you would hold me, you're shakin'
You're the risk, I'm gonna take it
Why aren't you here in my bedroom
Hopelessly boring without you
Too soon to tell you, I love you
Kiss you and tell you I love you!

God, I'm actually invested
Think I really want this
I'm not even kidding
No, I'm actually invested
Haven't even met yet
Wish that I was kidding, I'm not and
I hate it
God, I'm actually invested
Haven't even met him
Watch this be the wrong thing, classic
God, I'm jumping in the deep end
It's more fun to swim and
Heard the risk is drowning, but I'm gonna take it
Whoa-oh-oh
I'm gonna take it
Heard the risk is drowning, but I'm gonna take it

Too soon to tell you I love you
Too soon to tell you I love you
Too soon to tell you I love you
You're the risk, I'm gonna take it

"Mean It"

Talk to me more
You're a little bit bored, I'm a little bit tired
We don't fight though
You've been acting so cold, I don't know what you wanted

Every time we touch it's like the last time
Holding onto something when it's not right
Tell me to my face that you are all mine
You don't know what I'm feeling

Maybe that thing you said under your breath, you mean it
Holding on to thin lines till we just walk between 'em
Getting so loud, I can't pretend that I don't hear 'em
Maybe that thing you said under your breath, you mean it
I know you mean it

Do we let go?
Are we too far gone? I don't know what we started
I guess I don't know
Where we took a wrong turn, everything got harder

Every time we touch it's like the last time
Holding onto something when it's not right
Tell me to my face that you are all mine
You don't know what I'm feeling

Maybe that thing you said under your breath, you mean it
Holding on to thin lines till we just walk between 'em
Getting so loud, I can't pretend that I don't hear 'em
Maybe that thing you said under your breath, you mean it
I know you mean it
I know you mean it
I know you mean it
I know you mean it

"Mess It Up"

Open to double doors
Typical, pretty sure I could grow up
Probably chemical
I took up walking to turn it all off
Doesn't feel bearable
Guess I thought when I left it would all stop
It would all stop

Did I fall out of line when I called you?
When I told you I'm fine you were lied to
How could I think that all that I gave you was enough?
'Cause every time I get too close I just go mess it up

Funny that didn't work
I could be anywhere
I'm on your block
Cynical
Terrible
Kicking myself with my gut in a knot
'Cause I heard that you're happier
Hope that you're sleeping well, knowing I'm not
I'm doing too much

Did I fall out of line when I called you?
When I told you I'm fine, you were lied to
How could I think that all that I gave you was enough?
'Cause every time I get too close I just go mess it up

I keep thinking maybe if you let me back in
We could make it better, breaking every habit
Pull myself together
You could watch it happen
Let it happen
Let it happen

I keep thinking maybe if you let me back in
We could make it better, breaking every habit
Pull myself together
You could watch it happen
Let it happen
Let it happen

I keep thinking maybe if you let me back in
We could make it better, breaking every habit
Pull myself together
You could watch it happen
Let it happen
Let it happen

I keep thinking maybe if you let me back in
We could make it better, breaking every habit
Pull myself together
You could watch it happen
Let it happen
Let it happen

"Spark"

I heard a spark, something that glowed hundred feet higher
I opened my eyes when there is light to see if I'm closer
What if I stopped just for a while to make it go slower
Still up the night, just for a while to see if I'm finer, live like I'm finer

Tell me a tale, something with fire to break from the sorrow
To break through the dirt, piles of earth, to see where the sun goes
What if I stopped just for a while to see if I'm closer
Still up the night, just for a while to see where the sun goes

I heard a spark, something that glowed hundred feet higher
I opened my eyes when there is light to see if I'm closer
What if I stopped just for a while to see where the sun goes
Still half the night, just for a while to see if I'm finer, live like I'm finer

"Stay"

You told me something when I left but I don't remember
Maybe 'cause all I could do then was stare at the floor
I held myself 'cause you wouldn't, all wrapped in my sweatshirt
Wonder if you even noticed that that one was yours

And maybe I should've but I never told you I'm sorry
Know that I tried but my words always got in the way

Could you hold me without any talking
We could try to go back where we started
I don't even have to stay
I don't even have to stay but

If I woke up with you in the morning
I'd forget all the ways that we're broken
I don't care if you've changed
I don't even have to stay

I don't remember the last time I heard from your sister
Didn't expect to but I sort of thought that I would
Wish I could tell you by now that I felt more indifferent
Catch myself thinking about you more than I should

And maybe I should have but I never told you I miss you
I almost said it but don't know if you feel the same

Could you hold me without any talking
We could try to go back where we started
I don't even have to stay
I don't even have to stay but

If I woke up with you in the morning
I'd forget all the ways that we're broken
I don't care if you've changed
I don't even have to stay

"You Aren't Mine (Demo)"

It's been good to know you
This goodbye felt worst of all
No defining closure
No instruction manual
If you thought to call me
I would answer every time
Breaking up is funny
I forget you aren't mine

I forget you aren't mine
I forget you aren't mine
I forget you aren't mine

It's impossible to acclimate
Every time we talk we understate
How I know we both could die, we both could die
But you told me that you felt the same
When I told you how I needed space
But I think it was a lie, it was a lie

It's been tough to leave you
Every empty Sunday night
You come back in pieces
Every detail amplified
If you think to write me
It would go internalized
Breaking up is funny
I forget you aren't mine

I forget you aren't mine

It's impossible to acclimate
Every time we talk we understate
How I know we both could die, we both could die
But you told me that you felt the same
When I told you how I needed space
But I think it was a lie, it was a lie

And it's wild how it dissipates
How you're further from me everyday
This could be the worst goodbye, the worst goodbye
I don't even know what's left to say
Cuz' we called it back then anyway
Could you just remind why, remind me why

It's been weird to miss you
Hits me at the strangest times
Seven years would cut through
Other people like a knife
If I try to meet you
Couldn't look you in the eye
Breaking up is funny
I forget you aren't mine

I forget you aren't mine
