"All We Know"

We've tried so hard to understand
But we can't
We held the world out in our hands
And you ran away

It takes some time to let you go
And it shows

'Cause all we know is falling, it falls
And remember 'cause I know that we won't forget at all

Now we could follow you back home
But we won't
Is this what you had waited for?
Just to be alone?

It takes some time to let you go
And it shows

'Cause all we know is falling, it falls
And remember 'cause I know that we won't forget at all

You never
You never said
This wasn't what you wanted
Was it? Was it?
This isn't what you wanted
This isn't what you wanted

'Cause all we know is falling, it falls
And remember 'cause I know that we won't forget at all

"Pressure"

Tell me where our time went
And if it was time well spent
Just don't let me fall asleep
Feeling empty again

'Cause I fear I might break
And I fear I can't take it
Tonight I'll lie awake
Feeling empty

I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off
Without you
I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off
Without you

Now that I'm losing hope
And there's nothing else to show
For all of the days that we spent
Carried away from home

Some things I'll never know
And I had to let them go
I'm sitting all alone
Feeling empty

I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off
Without you
I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off
Without you
(Without you)

Some things I'll never know
And I had to let them go
Some things I'll never know
And I had to let them go
But I'm sitting all alone
Feeling empty

I can feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
We're better off
Without you
Feel the pressure
It's getting closer now
You're better off
Without me

"Emergency"

I think we have an emergency
I think we have an emergency
If you thought I'd leave then you were wrong
'Cause I won't stop holding on
So are you listening?
So are you watching me?

If you thought I'd leave then you were wrong
'Cause I won't stop holding on
This is an emergency
So are you listening?
And I can't pretend that I don't see this

It's really not your fault
That no one cares to talk about it
To talk about it

'Cause I've seen love die
Way too many times
When it deserved to be alive
(When it deserved to be alive)
And I've seen you cry
Way too many times
When you deserved to be alive
Alive

So you give up every chance you get
Just to feel new again
I think we have an emergency
I think we have an emergency
And you do your best to show me love
But you don't know what love is

So are you listening?
So are you watching me?
Well, I can't pretend that I don't see this

But it's really not your fault
That no one cares to talk about it
To talk about it

'Cause I've seen love die
Way too many times
When it deserved to be alive
(When it deserved to be alive)
And I've seen you cry
Way too many times
When you deserved to be alive
Alive

These scars, they will not fade away

No one cares to talk about it
To talk about it

'Cause I've seen love die
Way too many times
When it deserved to be alive
(When it deserved to be alive)
And I've seen you cry
Way too many times
When you deserved to be alive
Alive

"Brighter"

So this is how it goes
Well, I, I would have never known
And if it ends today
Well, I'll still say that you shine brighter than anyone

Now I think we're taking this too far
Don't you know that it's not this hard?
Well, it's not this hard
But if you take what's yours and I take mine
Must we go there?
Please, not this time
No, not this time

Well, this is not your fault
But if I'm without you then I will feel so small
And if you have to go
Well, always know that you shine brighter than anyone does

Now I think we're taking this too far
Don't you know that it's not this hard?
Well, it's not this hard
But if you take what's yours and I take mine
Must we go there?
Please, not this time
No, not this time

If you run away now
Will you come back around?
And if you ran away
I'd still wave goodbye watching you shine bright

Now I think we're taking this too far
Don't you know that it's not this hard?
Well, it's not this hard
But if you take what's yours and I take mine
Must we go there?
Please, not this time
No, not this time

(You shine bright)
And I'll wave goodbye watching you shine bright
(You shine bright)
And I'll wave goodbye tonight
(You shine bright)

"Here We Go Again"

And here we go again
With all the things we said
And not a minute spent
To think that we'd regret
So we just take it back
These words and hold our breath
Forget the things we swore we meant

I'll write you just to let you know
That I'm alright
Can't say I'm sad to see you go
'Cause I'm not
(No, I'm not)
Well, I'm not

And here we go again
With all the things we did
And now I'm wondering
Just who would I have been
To be the one attached
At all times to your hip?
Forget the things we swore we meant

I'll write you just to let you know
That I'm alright
Can't say I'm sad to see you go
'Cause I'm not
(No, I'm not)
Well, I'm not
(No, I'm not)
Oh-oh
(No, I'm not)

I'll write you to let you know
That I'm alright
Can't say I'm sad to see you go
'Cause I'm not
(No, I'm not)
Well, I'm not
(No, I'm not)
I'm not
I'm not

(And here we go again)
(With all the things we said
And not a minute spent)
(To think that we'd regret
So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
No
(So we just take it back)
I'm not
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
I'm not
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back)
(So we just take it back...)

"Never Let This Go"

Maybe if my heart stops beating, it won't hurt this much
And never will I have to answer again to anyone

Please, don't get me wrong

Because I'll never let this go
But I can't find the words to tell you
I don't wanna be alone (Don't wanna be alone)
But now I feel like I don't know you
Whoa

One day, you'll get sick of saying that everything's alright
And by then, I'm sure I'll be pretending just like I am tonight

Please, don't get me wrong

Because I'll never let this go
But I can't find the words to tell you
I don't wanna be alone (Don't wanna be alone)
But now I feel like I don't know you

Let this go
Let this go

But I'll never let this go
But I can't find the words to tell you
I don't wanna be alone (Don't wanna be alone)
But now I feel like I don't know you
And I'll never let this go (Never let this go)
But I can't find the words to tell you
That now I feel like I don't know you

"Whoa"

I've hoped for change
And it gets better everyday
I've hoped for change
But still I feel the same

There's something wrong
'Cause everybody knows
That we can do this on our own

And we've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

We're doing fine
And it gets better every time
We're doing fine
But I'll let you decide

There's something wrong
'Cause everybody knows
That we can do this on our own

And we've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
And we've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

And I'll confess
That I can be a little selfish
Yeah, I'll admit
I don't want you to help me through this
I don't want to start over again

And we've got everybody singing
And we've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
And we've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

And I'll confess
That I can be a little selfish, I can, I can
Yeah, I'll admit
I don't want you to get me through this
I don't want to start over again

"Conspiracy"

Please, speak softly for they will hear us
And they'll find out why we don't trust them
Speak up, dear, 'cause I cannot hear you
I need to know why we don't trust them

Explain to me this conspiracy against me
Yeah-eh, yeah
And tell me how I've lost my power
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

Where can I turn? 'Cause I need something more
Surrounded by uncertainty, I'm so unsure
Tell me why I feel so alone
'Cause I need to know to whom do I owe

Explain to me this conspiracy against me
Yeah-eh, yeah
And tell me how I've lost my power
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

I thought that we'd make it
Because you said that we'd make it through
And when all security fails
Will you be there to help me through?

Explain to me this conspiracy against me
Yeah-eh, yeah
And tell me how I've lost my power
Oh-oh

I've lost my power

"Franklin"

And when we get home, I know we won't be home at all
This place we live, it is not where we belong
And I miss who we were and the town that we could call our own
Going back to get away after everything has changed

'Cause you remind me of a time when we were so alive
Everything has changed
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?
Everything has changed
'Cause you help me push aside all that I have left behind
Everything is changed
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?

So we stand here now and no one knows us at all
I won't get used to this, I won't get used to being gone
And going back won't feel the same if we aren't staying
Going back to get away after everything has changed

'Cause you remind me of a time when we were so alive
Everything has changed
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?
Everything has changed
'Cause you help me push aside all that I have left behind
Everything is changed
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?

(Taking up our time)
(Taking up our time)
(Taking up our time)
It's taking up our time
We can't go back, we can't go back at all
It's taking up our time
We can't go back, we can't go back at all
It's taking up our time
We can't go back, we can't go back at all
It's taking up our time
Taking up our time

'Cause you remind me of a time
When we were so alive
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?

"My Heart"

I am finding out
That maybe I was wrong
That I've fallen down
And I can't do this alone

Stay with me
This is what I need, please

Sing us a song
And we'll sing it back to you
We could sing our own
But what would it be without you?
Oh-oh

I am nothing now
And it's been so long
Since I've heard a sound
The sound of my only hope

This time
I will be listening

Sing us a song
And we'll sing it back to you (Sing it back to you)
We could sing our own
But what would it be without you?

Alive

"Oh Star"

Oh, star
Fall down on me
Let me make a wish upon you
Hold on
Let me think
Think of what I'm wishing for

Wait
Don't go away
Just not yet
'Cause I thought
I had it
But I forget

And I won't let you fall away
From me
You will never fade

"This Circle"

Take this time to realize
That you always shut your eyes
In the midst of trial
And everything is always right

(And I think that it's time)
This battle must be won
(But you pushed it aside)
Pushed it aside, pretend that it's gone

This circle never ends

Just face it, don't pretend
That it's over

"For A Pessimist, I'm Pretty Optimistic"

Just talk yourself up and tear yourself down
You've hit your one wall, now find a way around
Well, what's the problem? You got a lot of nerve

So what did you think I would say?
No, you can't run away
No, you can't run away
So what did you think I would say?
No, you can't run away
No, you can't run away
You wouldn't

I never wanted to say this
You never wanted to stay
I put my faith in you, so much faith
And then you just threw it away
You threw it away

I'm not so naive, my sorry eyes can see
The way you fight shy of almost everything
Well, if you give up, you'll get what you deserve

So what did you think I would say?
No, you can't run away
No, you can't run away
So what did you think I would say?
No, you can't run away

You were finished long before
We had even seen the start
Why don't you stand up? Be a man about it
Fight with your bare hands about it now

I never wanted to say this (Say this)
You never wanted to stay, well, did you?
I put my faith in you, so much faith
And then you just threw it away
I never wanted to say this
You never wanted to stay
And I put my faith in you, so much faith
And then you just threw it away

"That's What You Get"

No, sir
Well, I don't wanna be the blame, not anymore
It's your turn
So take a seat we're settling the final score
And why do we like to hurt so much?

I can't decide
You have made it harder just to go on
And why?
All the possibilities, well I was wrong

That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa

I wonder
How am I supposed to feel when you're not here
'Cause I burned
Every bridge I ever built when you were here?
I still try
Holding onto silly things, I never learn
Oh why?
All the possibilities I'm sure you've heard

That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating (beating)
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa

Pain, make your way to me, to me
And I'll always be just so (so) inviting
If I ever start to think straight
This heart will start a riot in me
Let's start, start, hey!

Why do we like to hurt so much?
Oh why do we like to hurt so much?

That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa!
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
That's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa
Now I can't trust myself with anything but this
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, whoa

"Hallelujah"

Somehow everything's gonna fall right into place
If we only had a way to make it all fall faster every day
If only time flew like a dove
Well, God, make it fly faster than I'm falling in love

This time, we're not giving up
Let's make it last forever
Screaming, "Hallelujah!"
We'll make it last forever

Holding on to patience wearing thin
I can't force these eyes to see the end
If only time flew like a dove
Well, we could watch it fly and just keep looking up

This time, we're not giving up
Let's make it last forever
Screaming, "Hallelujah!"
We'll make it last forever

And we've got time on our hands
(We've got time) Got nothing but time on our hands
Got nothing but, got nothing but
(We've got time) Got nothing but time on our hands

This time, we're not giving up
Oh, let's make it last forever
Screaming, "Hallelujah!" ("Hallelujah!")
"Hallelujah!"

"Misery Business"

(Hit that, hit that snare)

I'm in the business of misery
Let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine she caught him by the mouth

I waited eight long months
She finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie he was the only one for me
Two weeks we caught on fire
She's got it out for me
But I wear the biggest smile

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But, God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could then you know you would
'Cause, God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

Second chances they don't ever matter, people never change
Once a whore you're nothing more, I'm sorry, that'll never change
And about forgiveness, we're both supposed to have exchanged
I'm sorry, honey, but I passed it up, now look this way
Well there's a million other girls who do it just like you
Looking as innocent as possible to get to who
They want and what they like, it's easy if you do it right
Well I refuse, I refuse, I refuse!

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But, God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him right now
And if you could then you know you would
'Cause, God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

I watched his wildest dreams come true
Not one of them involving you
Just watch my wildest dreams come true
Not one of them involving

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now

Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa, it was never my intention to brag
To steal it all away from you now
But, God, does it feel so good
'Cause I got him where I want him now
And if you could then you know you would
'Cause, God, it just feels so
It just feels so good

"When It Rains"

And when it rains
On this side of town it touches everything
Just say it again and mean it
We don't miss a thing

You made yourself a bed
At the bottom of the blackest hole (blackest hole)
And convinced yourself that
It's not the reason you don't see the sun anymore

And no, oh, how could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming
No, oh, I need the ending
So why can't you stay
Just long enough to explain?

And when it rains
Well, you always find an escape
Just running away
From all of the ones who love you
From everything

You made yourself a bed
At the bottom of the blackest hole (blackest hole)
And you'll sleep 'til May
And you'll say that you don't wanna see the sun anymore

And no, oh, how could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming
And no, oh, I need the ending
So why can't you stay just long enough to explain?

Take your time
Take my time

Take these chances to turn it around (take your time)
Just take these chances, we'll make it somehow
And take these chances to turn it around (take my...)
Just turn it around

No, how could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming
No, oh, how could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming
No, oh, how could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming
No, oh I need an ending
So why can't you stay
Just long enough to explain?

You can take your time
Take my time

"Let The Flames Begin"

What a shame we all became such fragile, broken things
A memory remains just a tiny spark
I give it all my oxygen
To let the flames begin
So let the flames begin

Oh, glory
Oh, glory
This is how we'll dance when
When they try to take us down
This is what we'll be, oh, glory

Somewhere weakness is our strength
And I'll die searching for it
I can't let myself regret such selfishness
My pain and oh the trouble caused
No matter how long
I believe that there's hope
Buried beneath it all and
Hiding beneath it all, and
Growing beneath it all

This is how we'll dance when
When they try to take us down
This is how we'll sing (oh)
This is how we'll stand when
When they burn our houses down
This is what we'll be, oh, glory

Reaching as I sink down into light (Into light)
Reaching as I sink down into light (Into light)

This is how we'll dance when
When they try to take us down
This is how we'll sing (oh)
This is how we'll stand when
When they burn our houses down
This is what we'll be, oh, glory

"Miracle"

I've gone for too long living like I'm not alive
So I'm gonna start over tonight
Beginning with you and I
When this memory fades
I'm gonna make sure it's replaced
With chances taken
Hope embraced
And have I told you?

I'm not going
'Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
And I'm not leaving
I won't let you
Let you give up on a miracle
When it might save you

We've learned to run from
Anything uncomfortable
We've tied our pain below and no one ever has to know
That inside we're broken
I try to patch things up again
To count my tears and kill these fears
But have I told you, have I?

I'm not going
'Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
And I'm not leaving
I won't let you
Let you give up on a miracle
When it might save you

It's not faith if (faith if), if you use your eyes
Oh why
We'll get it right this time (this time)
Let's leave this all behind
Oh why
We'll get it right this time
It's not faith if you're using your eyes
Oh why

I've gone for too long living like I'm not alive
So I'm gonna start over tonight
Beginning with you and

I don't want to run from anything uncomfortable
I just want, no
I just need this pain to end right here

I'm not going
'Cause I've been waiting for a miracle
And I'm not leaving
I won't let you
Let you give up on a miracle
'Cause it might save you

Yeah, it might save you
Oh, it might save you

It's not faith if, if you use your eyes
If you use your eyes
If you use your eyes

"crushcrushcrush"

I got a lot to say to you, yeah, I got a lot to say
I notice your eyes are always glued to me
You're keeping them here and it makes no sense at all

They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies
They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies

Crush, crush, crush
Crush, crush
(Two, three, four!)

Nothing compares to a quiet evening alone
Just the one, two, I was just counting on
That never happens, I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than this

If you want to play it like a game
Well, come on, come on, let's play
'Cause I'd rather waste my life pretending
Than have to forget you for one whole minute

They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies
They taped over your mouth
Scribbled out the truth with their lies
Your little spies

Crush, crush, crush
Crush, crush
(Two, three, four!)

Nothing compares to a quiet evening alone
Just the one, two, I was just counting on
That never happens, I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than this now

Rock and roll, baby, don't you know
That we're all alone now? I need something to sing about
Rock and roll, honey, don't you know, baby
We're all alone now? I need something to sing about
Rock and roll, hey, don't you know, baby
We're all alone now? Give me something to sing about

Nothing compares to a quiet evening alone
Just the one, two, I was just counting on
That never happens, I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than, no!

Nothing compares to a quiet evening alone
Just the one, two, I was just counting on
That never happens, I guess I'm dreaming again
Let's be more than, more than this

Ohoh ohoh ohoh
Oooh...

"We Are Broken"

I am outside
And I've been waiting for the sun
With my wide eyes
I've seen worlds that don't belong
My mouth is dry with words I cannot verbalize
Tell me why we live like this

Keep me safe inside
Your arms like towers
Tower over me

Yeah
'Cause we are broken
What must we do to restore
Our innocence
And all the promise we adored?
Give us life again
'Cause we just wanna be whole

Lock the doors
'Cause I'd like to capture this voice
It came to me tonight
So everyone will have a choice
And under red lights
I'll show myself it wasn't forged
We're at war
We live like this

Keep me safe inside
Your arms like towers
Tower over me

'Cause we are broken
What must we do to restore
Our innocence
And all the promise we adored?
Give us life again
'Cause we just wanna be whole

Tower over me
Tower over me

And I'll take the truth at any cost

'Cause we are broken
What must we do to restore
Our innocence
And all the promise we adored?
Give us life again
'Cause we just wanna be whole

"Fences"

I'm sitting in a room
Made up of only big white walls and in the hall
There are people looking through
The window in the door
They know exactly what we're here for

Don't look up
Just let them think
There's no place else
You'd rather be

You're always on display
For everyone to watch and learn from
Don't you know by now?
You can't turn back
Because this road is all you'll ever have

And it's obvious that you're dying, dying
Just living proof that the camera's lying
And oh oh open wide, 'cause this is your night
So smile, 'cause you'll go out in style
You'll go out in style

If you let me I could
I'd show you how to build your fences
Set restrictions, separate from the world
The constant battle that you hate to fight
Just blame the limelight

Don't look up
Just let them think
There's no place else
You'd rather be

And now you can't turn back
Because this road is all you'll ever have

And it's obvious that you're dying, dying
Just living proof that the camera's lying
And oh oh open wide, 'cause this is your night
So smile

Yeah, yeah you're asking for it
With every breath that you breathe in
Just breathe it in
Yeah, yeah well you're just a mess
You do all this big talking
So now let's see you walk it
I said let's see you walk it

Yeah, yeah well you're just a mess
You do all this big talking
So now let's see you walk it
I said let's see you walk it

And it's obvious that you're dying, dying
Just living proof that the camera's lying
And oh oh open wide, yeah oh oh open wide
Yeah, oh oh open wide
'Cause you'll go out in style
You'll go out in style

"Born For This"

Oh no I just keep on falling
(Back to the same old...)
And where's hope when misery comes crawling?
(Oh my way, ay...)
With your faith you'll trigger a landslide
(Victory)
To kill off this common sense of mine

It takes acquired minds to taste, to taste, to taste this wine
You can't down it with your eyes
So we don't need the headlines
We don't need the headlines
We just want

(We want the airwaves back, we want the airwaves back)

Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now?
Everybody live like it's the last day you will ever see
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now?

Right now you're the only reason
(I'm not letting go, oh...)
And time out if everyone's worth pleasing
(Ha-ha!)
You'll trigger a landslide
(Victory)
To kill off their finite state of mind

It takes acquired minds to taste, to taste, to taste this wine
You can't down it with your eyes
So we don't need the headlines
No, we don't want your headlines
We just want

(We want the airwaves back, we want the airwaves back)

Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now?
Everybody live like it's the last day you will ever see
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now?
Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure?

Alright, so you think you're ready?
OK, then you say this with me
Go!
We were born for this
We were born for this
Alright, so you think you're ready?
OK, then you say this with me
Go!
We were born for this
We were born for this
We were born for this
We were born for this

We were born for
We were born for

Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure?
Everybody live like it's the last day you will ever see
Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure now?
Everybody sing like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure?
Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure?

We were born for this
We were born for this
We were born for this

"Temporary"

I used to be so quick, so clever
I used to know myself much better
Anyone can see that this is only permanent
Temporary, it never hurts to try

And it's all a game
I know we'll stay the same
But repetition ends in failure
And every time I see it in your eyes
When repetition ends, we'll start over

Now I'm a walking contradiction
So tell me what's wrong with this picture
Cause anyone can see that this is only permanent
Temporary, so don't hurt me this time

And it's all a game
I know we'll stay the same
But repetition ends in failure
And every time I see it in your eyes
When repetition ends, we'll start over

So give it up, just give up
Give it up, give up
So give it up, just give up
Give it up, give up

And it's all a game
I know we'll stay the same
But repetition ends in failure
And every time I see it in your eyes
When repetition ends, we'll start over

We'll start over

"Decoy"

Close your eyes and make believe this is where you wanna be
Forgetting all the memories, try to forget love 'cause love's forgotten me

Well, hey, hey, baby, it's never too late
Pretty soon you won't remember a thing
And I'll be distant
The stars reminiscing
Your heart's been wasted on me

You've never been so used as I'm using you, abusing you
My little decoy
Don't look so blue, you should've seen right through
I'm using you, my little decoy
My little decoy

Live your life inside a dream
Time is changing everything
Forgetting all the memories
And I'm forced into you just 'cause you're into me

Well, hey, hey, baby, it's never too late
When I'm gone you won't remember a thing
But I can't stay
And you know I won't wait
I was gone from the very first day

You've never been so used as I'm using you, abusing you
My little decoy
Don't look so blue, you should've seen right through
I'm using you, my little decoy

Oh, oh
I'm not sorry at all
(Not sorry at all, not sorry. No.)
I won't be sorry at all
(Not sorry at all, not sorry. No.)
I'd do it over again

Don't look so blue, my little decoy
You should've seen right through, my little decoy
You've never been so used, my little decoy
And so I'm using you, my little decoy

"Stop This Song (Lovesick Melody)"

You say the sweetest things and I can't keep my heart from singing
Along to the sound of your song My stupid feet keep moving
To this 4/4 beat, I'm in time with you
Whoa, to this 4/4 beat I would die for you (die for you)

(Someone stop this)
I've gone too far to come back from here
But you don't have a clue
You don't know what you do to me

Won't someone stop this song
So I won't sing along
Someone stop this song
So I won't sing

I never let love in
So I could keep my heart from hurting
The longer that I live with this idea, the more I sink into this 4/4 beat
I'm in time with you
Whoa, to this 4/4 beat I would die for you (let's stop this song)

I've gone too far to come back from here
But you don't have a clue
You don't know what you do to me
I've come too far to get over you
And you don't have a clue
You don't know what you do to me

Can't someone stop this song
So I won't sing along
Someone stop this song
So I won't sing

Your lovesick melody
Is gonna get the best of me tonight
But you won't get to me if I don't sing

It creeps in like a spider
Can't be killed, although I try and try to
Well, don't you see I'm falling?
Don't wanna love you, but I do

(Lovesick melody) Can someone stop this song, so I won't sing along?
(Lovesick melody, oh) Can someone stop this song, so I won't sing?
Your lovesick melody
Is gonna get the best of me tonight
But you won't get to me, no
You won't get to me 'cause I won't sing

"Rewind"

Don't come looking for me
'Cause I'll be right here with the words you said
Looking for the words that you say
You know what you did you know
And how can anybody forget the promise that you made?
'Cause this is how a promise breaks
I always knew you'd fall through
And now you're proof

Rewind to the first time
That I felt it coming
I knew it would not last
Rewind to the first time
That I felt it coming
Make it quick, make it painless
Don't tell me lies just say goodbye

And now you're running from me
So cool, so scared of what you might have said
And no one's ever looked away
'Cause we know what you did, we know
If I told anybody, that we would soon forget your name
And you would never have a place
I always knew you'd fall through
And now you're proof

Rewind to the first time
That I felt it coming
I knew it would not last
Rewind to the first time
That I felt it coming
Make it quick, make it painless
Don't tell me lies just say goodbye

Please don't say too much oh, I
Think we've heard enough from you
Oh

Rewind to the first time
That I felt it coming
I knew it would not last
Rewind to the first time
That I felt it coming
Make it quick, make it painless
Don't tell me lies just say goodbye
Don't tell me lies just say goodbye

"Careful"

I settled down a twisted up frown
Disguised as a smile, well
You would've never known

I had it all
But not what I wanted
'Cause hope for me was a place uncharted and overgrown

You'd make your way in
I'd resist you just like this

You can't tell me to feel
The truth never set me free
So, I did it myself

You can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out a little more
More
More
More, more

Open your eyes
Like I opened mine
It's only the real world
A life you will never know

Shifting your weight
To throw off the pain
Well you can ignore it
But only for so long

You look like I did
You resist me just like this

You can't tell me to heal
And it hurts remembering
How it felt to shut down

Can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out a little more
More
More
More, more

The truth never set me free
The truth never set me free
The truth never set me free
So, I'll do it myself

You can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out

Can't be too careful anymore
When all that is waiting for you
Won't come any closer
You've got to reach out
More
More
More
More, more

"Ignorance"

If I'm a bad person, you don't like me
Well, I guess I'll make my own way
It's a circle, a mean cycle
I can't excite you anymore

Where's your gavel? Your jury?
What's my offense this time?
You're not a judge but if you're gonna judge me
Well, sentence me to another life

Don't wanna hear your sad songs
I don't wanna feel your pain
When you swear it's all my fault
'Cause you know we're not the same
No, we're not the same, no, oh, we're not the same

Yeah, the friends who stuck together
We wrote our names in blood
But I guess you can't accept that the change is good, hey
It's good, hey, it's good

Well, you treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you, sir
I guess I'll go, I best be on my way out

You treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you, sir
I guess I'll go, I best be on my way out

Ignorance is your new best friend
Ignorance is your new best friend

This is the best thing that could've happened
Any longer, and I wouldn't have made it
It's not a war, no, it's not a rapture
I'm just a person, but you can't take it

The same tricks that, that once fooled me
They won't get you anywhere
I'm not the same kid from your memory
Well, now I can fend for myself

Don't wanna hear your sad songs
I don't wanna feel your pain
When you swear it's all my fault
'Cause you know we're not the same
No, we're not the same, no, oh, we're not the same

Yeah, we used to stick together
We wrote our names in blood
But I guess you can't accept that the change is good, hey
It's good, hey, it's good

Well, you treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you, sir
Well, I guess I'll go, I best be on my way out

You treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you, sir
Well, I guess I'll go, I best be on my way out

Ignorance is your new best friend
Ignorance is your new best friend
Ignorance is your new best friend
Ignorance is your new best friend

Well, you treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you, sir
Well, I guess I'll go, I best be on my way out

You treat me just like another stranger
Well, it's nice to meet you, sir
I guess I'll go, I best be on my way out

"Playing God"

I can't make my own decisions
Or make any with precision
Well, maybe you should tie me up
So I don't go where you don't want me

You say that I've been changing
That I'm not just simply aging
Yeah, how could that be logical?
Just keep on cramming ideas down my throat
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

You don't have to believe me
But the way I, way I see it
Next time you point a finger
I might have to bend it back
Or break it, break it off
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror

If God's the game that you're playing
Well, we must get more acquainted
Because it has to be so lonely
To be the only one who's holy

It's just my humble opinion
But it's one that I believe in
You don't deserve a point of view
If the only thing you see is you
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

You don't have to believe me
But the way I, way I see it
Next time you point a finger
I might have to bend it back
Or break it, break it off
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror

This is the last second chance
(I'll point you to the mirror)
I'm half as good as it gets
(I'll point you to the mirror)
I'm on both sides of the fence
(I'll point you to the mirror)
Without a hint of regret
I'll hold you to it

I know you don't believe me
But the way I, way I see it
Next time you point a finger
I might have to bend it back
Or break it, break it off
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror

I know you won't believe me
But the way I, way I see it
Next time you point a finger
I might have to bend it back
Or break it, break it off
Next time you point a finger
I'll point you to the mirror

"Brick By Boring Brick"

She lives in a fairy tale
Somewhere too far for us to find
Forgotten the taste and smell
Of a world that she's left behind
It's all about the exposure the lens I told her
The angles are all wrong now
She's ripping wings off of butterflies

Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds
Well go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle

Ba da ba ba da ba ba da

So one day he found her crying
Coiled up on the dirty ground
Her prince finally came to save her
And the rest you can figure out
But it was a trick
And the clock struck twelve
Well make sure to build your home brick by boring brick
Or the wolf's gonna blow it down

Keep your feet on the ground
When your head's in the clouds

Well go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle, bury the castle
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
We'll bury the castle, bury the castle

Oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa

Well you built up a world of magic
Because your real life is tragic
Yeah you built up a world of magic

If it's not real
You can't hold it in your hand
You can't feel it with your heart
And I won't believe it
But if it's true
You can see it with your eyes
Oh, even in the dark
And that's where I want to be, yeah

(You'll be better off without me)
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle (Ooh), bury the castle
(You'll be better off without me)
Go get your shovel
And we'll dig a deep hole
To bury the castle (Ooh), bury the castle

Ba da ba ba da ba ba da
Ba da ba ba ba da ba ba
Ba da ba ba da ba ba da
Ba da ba ba ba ba ba ba

Ba da ba ba da ba ba da
Ba da ba ba ba da ba ba
Ba da ba ba da ba ba da
Ba da ba ba ba ba ba ba

"Turn It Off"

I scraped my knees while I was praying
And found a demon in my safest haven
Seems like it's getting harder to believe in anything
Than just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts

I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride
To see nothing in the light
But turn it off in all my spite, in all my spite
I'll turn it off

And the worst part is, before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I will realize that
I'm better off when I hit the bottom

The tragedy, it seems unending
I'm watching everyone I looked up to breaking, bending
We're taking shortcuts and false solutions
Just to come out the hero

Well I can see behind the curtain (I can see now)
The wheels are cranking turning
It's all wrong the way we're working
Towards a goal, that's non-existent, it's non-existent
But we just keep believing

And the worst part is, before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom

I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride
To see nothing in the light
But turn it off in all my spite, in all my spite
I'll turn it off
Just turn it off

Again
Again, again

And the worst part is, before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom

And the worst part is, before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I will realize
I'm better off when I hit the bottom

"The Only Exception"

When I was younger I saw my daddy cry
And curse at the wind
He broke his own heart and I watched
As he tried to reassemble it

And my momma swore
That she would never let herself forget
And that was the day that I promised
I'd never sing of love if it does not exist

But darling
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

Maybe I know somewhere deep in my soul
That love never lasts
And we've got to find other ways to make it alone
Or keep a straight face

And I've always lived like this
Keeping a comfortable distance
And up until now I had sworn to myself
That I'm content with loneliness

Because none of it was ever worth the risk

Well, you are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

I've got a tight grip on reality
But I can't let go of what's in front of me here
I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up
Leave me with some kind of proof it's not a dream
Oh-oh-oh-oh

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception
You are the only exception

And I'm on my way to believing
Oh, and I'm on my way to believing

"Feeling Sorry"

We still live in the same town, well, don't we?
But I don't see you around anymore
I go to all the same places
Not even a trace of you
Your days are numbered at 24

And I'm getting bored waiting 'round for you
We're not getting any younger
And I won't look back 'cause there's no use
It's time to move forward

I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cave
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time for feeling sorry

Well, I try not to think of what might happen
When your reality it finally cuts through
Well, as for me I got out and I'm on the road
The worst part is that this (this), this could be you

You know it, too
You can't run from your shame
You're not getting any younger
And time keeps passing by
But you wave it away
It's time to roll over

I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cave
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time for feeling sorry

And all the best lies
They are told with fingers tied
So cross 'em tight
Won't you promise me tonight
If it's the last thing you do
You'll get out

I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cave
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
Got no time, got no time

I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cave
You barely get by, the rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time
I've got no time for feeling sorry
I've got no time for feeling sorry

"Looking Up"

Things are looking up
Oh, finally
I thought I'd never see the day
When you'd smile at me

We always pull through
Oh, when we try
I'm always wrong
But you're never right
Oh, you're never right

Honestly, can you believe
We crossed the world while it's asleep?
I'd never trade it in
'Cause I've always wanted this and
It's not a dream anymore, no
It's not a dream anymore
It's worth fighting for

Could've given up so easily
I was a few cheap shots away
From the end of me

Taking for granted
Most everything
That I would've died for
Just yesterday
Just yesterday

Honestly, can you believe
We crossed the world while it's asleep?
I'd never trade it in
'Cause I've always wanted this and
It's not a dream anymore, no
It's not a dream anymore
It's worth fighting for

God knows the world doesn't need another band
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
But what a waste it would've been
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
I can't believe we almost hung it up
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
We're just getting started
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

Honestly, can you believe
We crossed the world while it's asleep?
I'd never trade it in
'Cause I've always wanted this and
It's not a dream anymore, no
It's not a dream anymore, no, oh
It's not a dream anymore, no, oh
It's not a dream anymore
It's worth fighting for

I can't believe we almost hung it up
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
We're just getting started
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
I can't believe we almost hung it up
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
We're just getting started
Yeah, we're just getting started

"Where The Lines Overlap"

Give me attention
I need it now
Too much distance
To measure it out
Out loud
Tracing patterns across a personal map
And making pictures where the lines overlap
Where the lines overlap

No one is as lucky as us
We're not at the end but oh we already won
No, no, no one is as lucky as us
Is as lucky as us

Call me over
And tell me how, well, you got so far
Never making a single sound
I'm not used to it but I can learn
There's nothing to it
I've never been happier
Never been happier

No one is as lucky as us
We're not at the end but oh we already won
Oh, no, no one is as lucky as us
Is as lucky as us

Now I've got a feeling
If I sang this loud enough
You would sing it back to me
I've got a feeling
If I sang this loud enough
You would sing it back to me

I've got a feeling
I've got a feeling
That you would sing it back to me
That you would sing it back to me

No one is as lucky as us
We're not at the end but oh we already won
Oh, no, no one (no one) is as lucky as us
Is as lucky as us
Is as lucky as us

"Misguided Ghosts"

I am going away for a while
But I'll be back don't try and follow me
'Cause I'll return as soon as possible

See, I'm trying to find my place
But it might not be here where I feel safe
We all learn to make mistakes

And run from them, from them
With no direction
We'll run from them, from them
With no conviction

'Cause I'm just one of those ghosts
Travelin' endlessly
Don't need no roads
In fact, they follow me
And we just go in circles

But now I'm told that this is life
And pain is just a simple compromise
So we can get what we want out of it

Would someone care to classify
Our broken hearts and twisted minds
So I can find someone to rely on?

And run to them, to them
Full-speed ahead
Oh, you are not useless
We are just

Misguided ghosts
Travelin' endlessly
The ones we trusted the most
Pushed us far away
And there's no one road
And we should not be the same
But I'm just a ghost
And still they echo me
They echo me in circles

"All I Wanted"

Think of me when you're out
When you're out there
I'll beg you nice from my knees
And when the world treats you way too fairly
Well it's a shame I'm a dream

All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you

I think I'll pace my apartment a few times
And fall asleep on the couch
And wake up early to black and white reruns
That escape from my mouth

Oh-oh, oh-oh

All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you

I could follow you to the beginning
Just to relive the start
Maybe then we'd remember to slow down
At all of our favorite parts

All I wanted was you

All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you
All I wanted was you

"Decode"

How can I decide what's right
When you're clouding up my mind?
I can't win your losing fight all the time
How can I ever own what's mine
When you're always taking sides
But you won't take away my pride
No not this time
Not this time

How did we get here?
Well, I used to know you so well
How did we get here?
Well, I think I know

The truth is hiding in your eyes
And it's hanging on your tongue
Just boiling in my blood
But you think that I can't see
What kind of man that you are
If you're a man at all
Well, I will figure this one out
On my own
(I'm screaming, "I love you so!")
On my own
(My thoughts you can't decode)

How did we get here?
Well, I used to know you so well, yeah
How did we get here?
Well, I think I know

Do you see what we've done?
We've gone and made such fools of ourselves
Do you see what we've done?
We've gone and made such fools of ourselves

Yeah...!

How did we get here?
Well, I used to know you so well, yeah, yeah
How did we get here?
[Album version:] Well, I used to know you so well
[Acoustic version:] Why won't you show yourself?

I think I know
I think I know

Ooh, there is something
I see in you
It might kill me
I want it to be true

"Fast In My Car"

Been through the wringer a couple times
I came out callous and cruel
And my two friends know this very well
Because they went through it too

The three of us were initiates
We had to learn how to deal
And when we spotted a second chance
We had to learn how to steal

Hollowed out and filled up with hate
All we want is you to give us a break

We're driving fast in my car
We've got our riot gear on but we just want to have fun
No, we're not looking for violence, no oh oh oh
Tonight we want to have fun

No one's the same as they used to be
Much as we try to pretend
No one's as innocent as could be
We all fall short, we all sin

But now we aren't looking backward
We won't try raising the dead
We only see what's in front of us
We only see straight ahead

Hollowed out and filled up with hate
All we want is you to give us a break

We're driving fast in my car
We've got our riot gear on but we just want to have fun
No, we're not looking for violence, no oh oh oh
Tonight we want to have fun

Get in my car and we'll drive around
We'll make believe we are free
Already proved we can tough it out

And we get along so sweetly

We're driving fast in my car
We've got our riot gear on but we just want to have fun
No, we're not looking for violence, no oh oh oh
Tonight we want to have fun (Oh, oh, oh, oh)

We're driving fast in my car
We're driving fast in my car
And we're not looking for violence, no oh oh oh
We're driving fast in my car
And we just want to have fun

"Now"

Don't try to take this from me
Don't try to take this from me
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow

Don't try to take this from me
Don't try to take this from me
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow

Feels like I'm waking from the dead
And everyone's been waitin' on me
'Least now I'll never have to wonder
What it's like to sleep a year away
But weren't we indestructible?
I thought that we could brave it all (all)
I never thought that what would take me out
Was hiding down below

Lost the battle, win the war
I'm bringing my sinking ship back to the shore
Starting over or head back in
There's a time and a place to die, but this ain't it

If there's a future, we want it
(Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow)
If there's a future, we want it
(Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow)
If there's a future, we want it
(Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow)
If there's a future, we want it
(Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow)

Don't try to take this from me
Don't try to take this from me
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow

Don't try to take this from me
Don't try to take this from me
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow

Wish I could find a crystal ball
For the days I feel completely worthless
You know I'd use it all for good
I would not take it for granted (granted)
Instead I have some memories... For the days I don't feel anything
At the least, they will remind me not to make the same mistakes again

Lost the battle, win the war
I'm bringing my sinking ship back to the shore
We're starting over or head back in
There's a time and a place to die but this ain't it

If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow

There's a time and a place to die
There's a time and a place to die
And this ain't it
There's a time and a place to die
And this ain't it, this ain't it
This ain't it

There's a time and a place to die
There's a time and a place to die
But this ain't it, no

If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
If there's a future, we want it now
Now!
(Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow)

If there's a future, we want it
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
Now-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow

"Grow Up"

I told 'em all where to stick it
I left town with a dime to my name
Said I'm done with all of my fake friends
Self-righteous pawns in a losing game

Got my band and a light that won't go out
Been burning since the day I was born
So I cried just a little then I'll dry my eyes
'Cause I'm not a little girl no more

Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind

Stood in line for so long just to picket
Something I won't ever understand
Aren't you tired of always being mad at the world?
Won't you just admit you don't care?

And, lady, I don't want your pity
So don't feel sad for me
I got a love I would die for and a song to sing
Maybe we're both just living out our dream

And some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind

We get along for the most part
Me and reality, the light and the dark
We live alone, two different worlds
Me in a fantasy, you in your memories
But we get along

We get along
(For the most part)
We get along
(yeah, for the most part)
We get along
(For the most part)
We get along

We get along
We get along

Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind (leave you behind)
Some of us have to grow up sometimes
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind (leave you behind)

Some of us have to grow up sometimes (we grow up, never grow old)
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind
Some of us have to grow up sometimes (we grow up, never grow old)
And so, if I have to I'm gonna leave you behind

"Daydreaming"

Living in a city of sleepless people
Who all know the limits and won't go too far outside the lines
'Cause they're out of their minds
I wanna get out and build my own home
On a street where reality is not much different from dreams I've had
A dream is all I have

Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming
Daydreaming into the night

Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming
Daydreaming into the night

And I'm alright

Creep past the hours like the shorter hand on the clock
Hanging on a wall of a schoolhouse somewhere
We wait for the bell
And we dream of somewhere else

Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming
Daydreaming into the night

Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time
Daydreaming
Daydreaming into the night

And I'm alright

It's not that I won't remember where I'm from
Just don't wanna be here no more
It's not enough, ha-ah-ah-ah-oh
(We're only half alive)
I'm gonna go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(We're only half alive)
Where the rest of the dreamers go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
(We're only half alive)
Where the dreamers go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-ooh

Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time (a dream is all I have)
Daydreaming
Daydreaming into the night
And I'm alright

Daydreaming
Daydreaming all the time (a dream is all I have)
Daydreamer
We used to be half alive
Now I'm alright

I'm alright
I'm alright

"Interlude: Moving On"

Let 'em have their time
Sit back and let 'em shine
Let 'em rise and rise
'Cause one day they're gonna fall
Let 'em soak in the sun
Sit back and let 'em have their fun
Let 'em spill their guts
'Cause one day they're gonna slip on 'em

Well, I could be angry, but you're not worth the fight
And besides I'm moving on
I've counted to ten and now I'm feeling alright
And besides I'm moving on

Let 'em play their songs
Let 'em say what's right and wrong
Let 'em do their thing
'Cause they'll never be you and me
We've got our own style
We've got a way of living life
If they can't get down
Well, we don't need them around

Well, I could be angry, but you're not worth the fight
And besides I'm moving on
I've counted to ten and now I'm feeling alright
And besides I'm moving
Yes, I'm moving
Besides I'm moving on

"Ain't It Fun"

I don't mind
Lettin' you down easy, but just give it time
If it don't hurt now, well, just wait, just wait a while
You're not the big fish in the pond no more
You are what they're feedin' on

So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you?
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, uh-uh-uh)
So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you?

Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world?
Ain't it good
Bein' all alone?

Where you're from
You might be the one who's runnin' things
Well, you could ring anybody's bell and get what you want
You see, it's easy to ignore trouble
When you're livin' in a bubble

So what are you gonna do
When the world don't orbit around you?
(Mm-mmm, uh-uh)
So what are you gonna do
When nobody wants to fool with you?
(Oh-oh-oh, uh-uh-uh)

Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world?
Ain't it good
Bein' all alone?
(Oh-oh-oh) Ain't it good to be on your own?
(Oh-oh-oh) Ain't it fun you can't count on no one?
(Uh-uh-uh) Ain't it good to be on your own?
(Uh-uh-uh) Ain't it fun you can't count on no one?
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world?

Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' to your mama
'Cause you're on your own in the real world

Ain't it fun? Ain't it fun?
Baby, now you're one of us
Ain't it fun? Ain't it fun?
Ain't it fun?

Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world?
Ain't it good (Ain't it goo-oo-ood)
Bein' all alone?
Ain't it fun
Livin' in the real world?
('Cause the world don't orbit around you)
Ain't it good (Ain't it goo-oo-ood)
Bein' all alone?
Uh-uh, uh-uh-uh-uh

Don't go cryin' to your mama (Not to your mama)
'Cause you're on your own in the real world (Don't go cryin')
Don't go cryin' to your mama (To your mama)
'Cause you're on your own in the real world (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Don't go cryin' to your mama (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause you're on your own in the real world (This is the real world)
Don't go cryin' to your mama (Don't go cryin')
'Cause you're on your own in the real world (This is the real world)
Don't go cryin' to your mama (This is the real world, don't go cryin')
'Cause you're on your own in the real world (Oh, oh)
Don't go cryin' to your mama (Don't you cry to your mama)
'Cause you're on your own in the real world
Don't go cryin' (Don't you go, don't you go cryin')
Don't go cryin' (You're on your own)
Don't go cryin' (Don't go cryin' to your mama)
Don't go cryin' (Don't you cry, don't you cry)

"Part II"

What a shame, what a shame we all remain
Such fragile broken things
A beauty half betrayed
Butterflies with punctured wings
Still there are darkened places deep in my heart
Where once was blazing light, now
There's a tiny spark

Oh glory
Come and find me
Oh glory
Come and find me

Dancing all alone to the sound of an enemy's song
I'll be lost until you find me
Fighting on my own in a war that's already been won
I'll be lost until you come and find me here
Oh glory

Here

What a mess, what a mystery we've made
Of love and other simple things
Learning to forgive even when it wasn't a mistake
I question every human who won't look in my eyes
Scars left on my heart formed patterns in my mind

Oh glory
You will find me

Dancing all alone to the sound of an enemy's song
I'll be lost until you find me
Fighting on my own in a war that's already been won
I'll be lost until you come and find me here
Oh glory

(I'll be lost until)
Like the moon we borrow our light
I am nothing but a shadow in the night
So if you let me I will catch fire
To let your glory and mercy shine

"Last Hope"

I don't even know myself at all
I thought I would be happy by now
The more I try to push it, I realize
Gotta let go of control

Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Just let it happen

It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

Every night I try my best to dream
Tomorrow makes it better
Then I wake up to the cold reality
And not a thing has changed

But it will happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen

It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

And the salt in my wounds
Isn't burning any more than it used to
It's not that I don't feel the pain
It's just I'm not afraid of hurting anymore
And the blood in these veins
Isn't pumping any less than it ever has
And that's the hope I have
The only thing I know that's keeping me alive
Alive

Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen
Gotta let it happen

It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
(So if I let go of control now, I can be strong)
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing
It's just a spark, but it's enough
To keep me going
(So if I keep my eyes closed, with the blind hope)
And when it's dark out, no one's around
It keeps glowing

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

"Still Into You"

Can't count the years on one hand
That we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better

It's not a walk in the park
To love each other
But when our fingers interlock,
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it
'Cause after all this time I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)

Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time I'm still into you

Recount the night that
I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya

You felt the weight of the world
Fall off your shoulder
And to your favorite song
We sang along to the start of forever
And after all this time I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far
'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time I'm still into you

Well, some things just, some things just make sense
And one of those is you and I (Hey)
Some things just, some things just make sense
And even after all this time (Hey)

I'm into you, baby, not a day goes by
That I'm not into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)
And baby even on our worst nights
I'm into you (I'm into you)
Let 'em wonder how we got this far

'Cause I don't really need to wonder at all
Yeah, after all this time
I'm still into you
I'm still into you
I'm still into you

"Anklebiters"

Why do you care what people think?
Are you hooked up to their leash?
You know anklebiters
Ate up your personality

Try to remember how it felt
To just make up your own steps
And let anklebiters
Chew up, spit out someone else

Fall in love with yourself

Because someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got
Someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got

Why you wanna please the world
And leave yourself to drop dead?
Someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got

What do you actually expect?
A broken mirror to reflect?
You know, anklebiters
Gave you a false perception

And why do I defend
(C'mon, c'mon) your ignorance?
Oh, why do I defend
(C'mon, c'mon) the state you're in?

You should fall in love
With yourself, oh, again
Fall in love with yourself

Because someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got
Someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got

Why you wanna please the world
And leave yourself to drop dead?
Someday you're gonna be
The only one you've got

Anklebiters! Anklebiters!
Someday you're gonna be alone!
Anklebiters! Anklebiters!

"Interlude: Holiday"

(Mmhmm)

Now I can move on to facing
Big girl problems
No more high school drama
Graduated with honors

And I'm drinkin' coffee while I
Read the paper
I've been savin' money, eatin'
Only top ramen

Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Now I get a holiday
Wherever I go I might stay
I don't plan on coming back
Ever if I can help it

Now I get a holiday
I think I'll stay
Holiday, think I'll stay
Now I get a holiday

"Proof"

It's really hard
I can't cry in your arms
'Cause you're not here
It's not your fault
And if it was I wouldn't care

My heart is bigger
Than the distance
In-between us
I know it 'cause I
Feel it beating

So strong it'll knock you down
So strong, so strong

Over here
I can't count the miles away
From where I wanna be
I bet your skin is warm
And that you're smiling

Yeah, that's what I always
Loved the most about you
You're so strong
Come and knock me down, hey

Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am
(Whoa-oh-oh), if I'm a woman with no fear
Just like I claim I am, (whoa-oh-oh)
Then I believe in what you say
There's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you

I'll get in my car
Drive it faster than I
Ever did before
Head out west until I finally
Reach the shore

And then I'll swim out
To wherever you are
And we'll ride the undercurrent
Down to the floor

Making friends with all
The unfamiliar creatures
And pushing back
All the unnecessary pressure
Come up for air just so you
Know we won't drown

You're so strong
The world can't keep us down, hey!

Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am
(Whoa-oh-oh), if I'm a woman with no fear
Just like I claim I am, (whoa-oh-oh)
Then I believe in what you say
There's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you

Yeah, ooh, yeah, hey
Yeah, ooh, yeah, hey

So do you love me? (Yeah)
All you gotta do is say yes
Now do you love me? (Yeah, hey)
And I won't ever second guess

Now do you love me? (Yeah)
All you gotta do is say yes
Now do you love me? (Yeah, hey)
Then you already proved it

Yeah, yeah, hey

Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am
(Whoa-oh-oh), if I'm a woman with no fear
Just like I claim I am, (whoa-oh-oh)
Then I believe in what you say
There's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is

Baby, if I'm half the man I say I am
(Whoa-oh-oh), if I'm a woman with no fear
Just like I claim I am, (whoa-oh-oh)
Then I believe in what you say
There's nothing left for you to do
The only proof that I need is you

"Hate To See Your Heart Break"

There is not a single word in the whole world
That could describe the hurt
The dullest knife just sawing back and forth
And ripping through the softest skin there ever was

How were you to know?
Oh, how were you to know?

And I, I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before
And I, I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before

Love happens all the time
To people who aren't kind
And heroes who are blind
Expecting perfect scripted movie scenes
Who wants an awkward silent mystery?

How were you to know?
Well, how were you to know-oh-oh?

And I, I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before
And I, I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before

For all the air that's in your lungs
For all the joy that is to come
For all the things that you're alive to feel
Just let the pain remind you hearts can heal

Oh, how were you to know? (How were you to know?)
Oh, how were you to know?

And I, I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before
And I, I hate to see your heart break
I hate to see your eyes get darker as they close
But I've been there before

"(One Of Those) Crazy Girls"

Now when you say you wanna slow down
Does it mean you wanna slow dance?
Maybe you just want a little extra time
To focus on our romance

What do you mean I got it backwards?
You know we're gonna be forever
Why are you tellin' me goodbye?
Aren't you gonna stay the night?

Are we really over now?
Maybe I can change your mind?
Soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times

Now I walk under a pink sky (ooh)
Lovers float along and pass me by
I pour my heart out to your voice mail
Let you know I caught a bus
To your side of town

And now I'm standing at your doorstep
With Los Angeles behind me
If you don't answer I'll just use the key
That I copied 'cause I really need to see you

If you're not here when I break in
I'm gonna go to your closet
Just so I can smell your skin
As the chemicals swim
I know I'll never love again
I swear I'll never love again!

Baby, are we over now?
Maybe I can change your mind?
As soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times!

I'm not one of those crazy girls
I'm not one of those crazy girls
I'm not one of those crazy girls
I'm not one of those crazy girls

Hey, baby, are we over now?
Maybe I can change your mind?
As soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times!

Baby, are we over now?
Maybe I can change your mind?
Soon as you walk out my door
I'm gonna call a hundred times!

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Now I'm one of those crazy girls
Now I'm one of those crazy girls
Now I'm one of those crazy girls
Now I'm one of those crazy girls

"Interlude: I'm Not Angry Anymore"

I'm not angry anymore
Well, sometimes I am
I don't think badly of you
Well, sometimes I do

It depends on the day
The extent of all my worthless rage
I'm not angry anymore

I'm not bitter anymore
I'm syrupy sweet
I rot your teeth down to their core
If I'm really happy

Depends on the day
If I wake up in a giddy haze
Well, I'm not angry
I'm not totally angry
I'm not all that angry anymore

"Be Alone"

So what if I don't have
A lot to talk about?
I shut my mouth and keep it
Locked until it counts

And what if I don't ever want
To leave my house?
Stay on the couch while
All my friends are going out

Alone

You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too lonely

I'll make the journey down the hall
Back to my room
And kill more time, and let it rot
Inside its tomb (inside its tomb)

See, I ain't one to climb
Some social ladder too
Some Shangri-La
That all the cool kids will abuse

Alone

You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too lonely

(We could be alone together)

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm a loner, I'm in love with you alone

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Come, be a loner, be in love with me alone

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh

You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too lonely

You should be alone
Yeah, you should be alone
You should be alone with me
We could be alone
Yeah, we could be alone
But never get too lonely

"Future"

That's how you had it, yeah
Pretty sure

It is. It goes clapping a bit

Something just in that way
Alright, here we go

You go octave down this time

I'm writing the future
I'm writing it out, loud
We don't talk about the past
We don't talk about the past now

So, I'm writing the future
I'm leaving a key here
Something won't always be missing
You won't always feel emptier

Just think of the future
And think of your dreams
You'll get away from here
You'll get away eventually

So, just think of the future
Think of a new life
And don't get lost in the memories
Keep your eyes on a new prize

"Escape Route"

I've got a life out there somewhere
It's waiting
Lined with palm trees and only new faces
If I could look past the present and get there
Well baby, it's worth a shot

Just enough time to plan an escape route
I put my map on the wall in the basement
Not quite a victory to run from your problems
But it's the only plan that I got
It's the only plan that I got

And if you try to find me now

Oh
Oh oh oh!

I'm in all the echoes that have faded out
So... I'm moving on
'Cause I just want to feel for once that I belong
That's what's going on
That's what's going on

Crossed the state line and called out a warning
Not too long now, I'll breathe California
Paid my dues and I tried to be loyal
But now I'm done with all that

Where I'm going is everyone's story
We want
You left
And we're left to start over

It's not a question of who are we really
It's who we want to be

And if you try to find me now

Oh
Oh oh!

I'm in all the echoes that have faded out
So... I'm moving on
'Cause I just want to feel for once that I belong
And that's what's going on

All that's in between
A brand new life and I is time
But time has not been kind
It's not been kind to me
It's winding backwards

Time has not been kind
It's crawling by
So
Slowly

And if you try to find me now

Oh
Oh oh oh!

I'm in all the echoes that have faded out
So... I'm moving on
'Cause I just want to feel for once that I belong
And that's what's going on
And if you try to find me now

Oh
Oh oh oh

I'm in all the echoes that have faded out
So... I'm moving on
'Cause I just want to feel for once that I belong
And that's what's going on

"Native Tongue"

How can they say
That it's one way
When it's the opposite?
And how can they know
The end of the story
Before I tell it?

'Cause when I walk
Your feet, they fall
To the same beat
Or maybe we're from two different worlds
But we got our own language!

We talk to people
But they never understand!
They think we're crazy
'Cause it sounds like noise

When we're speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue!
We're speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue!

We used to live
Like we were strangers
We didn't know any better!
We didn't fit
In with the out crowd
So we gave in
And we shut our mouths!

But oh I love your history
And I can take it!
And when you talk in code to me
I can translate it!
We talk to people
But they never understand!

They think we're crazy
'Cause it sounds like noise to them
Ain't it strange
All the things you hear
When you sit
And listen?

We're speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue!
We're speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue!

And all this time I've been wasting my breath
Just wasting my words on everyone else!

Now I'm speaking in my native
Speaking in my native tongue!

So come on
Talk it out!
So come on
Talk it out!
So come on
And talk talk talk talk talk -
Talk it out
(Your voice, it brought me back from the dead, somehow)
So come on and
Talk talk talk talk talk
Talk it out!

OUT!

OUT!

OUT!

Speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue!
We're speaking in our native
Speaking in our native tongue!

(You know we speak in my native aoohh)
And all this time I've been wasting my breath
Just wasting my words on everyone else!
(You know we speak in my native aoohh)
Now speaking in my native
Speaking in my native tongue!

"Tell Me It's Okay"

Maybe it's been years since I genuinely smiled
And maybe it's been years since I wanted to be a part of anything

But lately I've been good
You know, I've actually been great
Man, I even laughed a little today

Oh, it's so strange
It's so strange

Tell me it's okay to be happy now
because I'm happy now
Tell me it's okay to be happy now
because I'm happy now

Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay

I thought it was my right to be as sorry as I wanted to be
I wasted all my teenage years being a misery factory

But something had to give
I had to finally see the light
I think at 23 it's time to practice what I preach
And what I preach is...

Tell me it's okay to be happy now
because I'm happy now
Tell me it's okay to be happy now
because I'm happy now

Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay

All my wasted hope
I let go when I should've held tighter
And now when the sun is out
I let it burn
Not afraid to feel it shine on me

Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay

Tell me it's okay to be happy now
because I'm happy now
Tell me it's okay to be happy now
My life is finally leveling out so

Tell me it's okay to be happy now
because I'm happy now
Tell me it's okay to be happy now
My life is finally leveling out so

Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay
Tell me it's okay
Tell me it's okay-ay

"Hard Times"

All that I want
Is to wake up fine
Tell me that I'm alright
That I ain't gonna die
All that I want
Is a hole in the ground
You can tell me when it's alright
For me to come out

Hard times
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times
Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
These lives
And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times
Hard times

And I gotta get to rock bottom

Walking around
With my little rain cloud
Hanging over my head
And it ain't coming down
Where do I go?
Gimme some sort of sign
You hit me with lightning!
Maybe I'll come alive

Hard times
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times
Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
These lives
And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times
Hard times

And I gotta hit rock bottom

Tell my friends I'm coming down
We'll kick it when I hit the ground
Tell my friends I'm coming down
We'll kick it when I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground

Hard times
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times
Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
These lives
And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times (hard times)
Hard times (hard times)

Hard times
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
Hard times
Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
These lives
And I still don't know how I even survive
Hard times (hard times)
Hard times

(Makes you wonder why you even try
Makes you wonder why you even try
Makes you wonder why you even try
Makes you wonder sometimes)

(Still don't know how I even survive
Still don't know how I even survive
Still don't know how I even survive
Still don't know how I survive)

And I gotta get to rock bottom

"Rose-Colored Boy"

Low-key, no pressure, just hang with me and my weather
Low-key, no pressure, just hang with me and my weather

Rose-colored boy
I hear you making all that noise
About the world you want to see
And oh, I'm so annoyed
'Cause I just killed off what was left of the optimist in me

Hearts are breaking, wars are raging on
And I have taken my glasses off
You got me nervous
I'm right at the end of my rope
A half-empty girl
Don't make me laugh, I'll choke

Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy

Low-key, no pressure, just hang with me and my weather

And I want you to stop insisting that I'm not a lost cause
'Cause I've been through a lot
Really all I've got is just to stay pissed off
If it's alright by you

But hearts are breaking, and wars are raging on
And I have taken my glasses off
You got me nervous
When you're turning it into a joke
A half-empty girl
Don't make me laugh, I'll...

Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey, man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy

Leave me here a little bit longer
I think I wanna stay in the car
I don't want anybody seeing me cry now
You say "We gotta look on the bright side"
I say "Well maybe if you wanna go blind"
You say my eyes are getting too dark now
But boy, you ain't ever seen my mind

Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
Hey, man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy
Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile if I don't want to
I know we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy

Low-key, no pressure, just hang with me and my weather
Low-key, no pressure, just hang with me and my weather

"Told You So"

For all I know
The best is over and the worst is yet to come
Is it enough?
To keep on hoping when the rest have given up?
And they go

I hate to say I told you so
But they love to say they told me so
I hate to say I told you so
But they love to say they told me

Say they say they told me
Say they say they told me
You say, you say you told me

I know you like
When I admit that I was wrong and you were right
At least I try
To keep my cool when I am thrown into a fire
And they go

I hate to say I told you so
But they love to say they told me so
I hate to say I told you so
But they love to say they told me

Say they say they told me
Say they say they told me
You say, you say you told me

Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again

Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again
Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again

I hate to say I told you so
But they love to say they told me so
I hate to say I told you so
But they love to say they told me

(Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again)
Say they say they told me
(Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again)
Say they say they told me
(Throw me into the fire
Throw me in, pull me out again)
You say, you say you told me
Say they told me, say they told me, told you so

"Forgiveness"

You hurt me bad this time, no coming back
And I cried till I couldn't cry, another heart attack
If I lay on the floor, maybe I'll wake up
And I don't pick up when you call
'Cause your voice is a gun
Every word is a bullet hole
Shot a hole in the sun
If I never look up maybe I'll never notice

And you, you want forgiveness
But I, I just can't do it yet

There's still a thread that runs from your body to mine
And you can't break what you don't see, an invisible line
If I follow it down will we just be alright?
But it could take me all your life to learn to love
How I thought I could love someone
I haven't even begun
If it's all up to us we might as well give up

And you, you want forgiveness
(I can barely hang on to myself)
But I, I can't give you that
(I can't give you, I can't give you that)
And you, you want forgiveness
(I'm afraid that I'll have nothing left)
But I, I just can't do it yet
(I can't do, I just can't do it yet)

Don't you go and get it twisted
Forgiving is not forgetting
Don't you go and get it twisted
Forgiving is not forgetting
No, it's not forgetting
No, I'll never forget it, no

And you, you want forgiveness
(I can barely hang on to myself)
But I, I can't give you that
(I can't give you, I can't give you that)
And you, you want forgiveness
(I'm afraid that I'll have nothing left)
But I, I just can't do it yet
(I can't do, I just can't do it yet)

"Fake Happy"

I love making you believe
What you get is what you see
But I'm so fake happy
I feel so fake happy
And I bet everybody here
Is just as insincere
We're all so fake happy
And I know fake happy

So I've been doing a good job of makin' 'em think
I'm quite alright, better hope I don't blink
You see it's easy when I'm stomping on a beat
But no one sees me when I crawl back underneath

If I smile with my teeth
Bet you believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I believe me

Oh please don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh what's the use
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too

And if I go out tonight, dress up my fears
You think I look alright with these mascara tears?
See I'm gonna draw up my lipstick wider than my mouth
And if the lights are low they'll never see me frown

If I smile with my teeth
Bet you believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I believe me

Oh please don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh oh what's the use?
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too

I know I said that I was doing good and that I'm happy now
I should've known when things were going good that's when I'd get knocked down

Oh please, just don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh no, oh what's the use?
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too

(Oh please)
(Oh please)

Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too

(Carlos...)

"26"

Man, you really know how to get someone down
Everything was fine until you came around
I've been chasing after dreamers in the clouds
After all wasn't I the one who said
To keep your feet on the ground?
Man, you really brought me back down

Hold on to hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
They say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

You got me tied up but I stay close to the window
And I talk to myself about the places that I used to go
I'm hoping someday maybe I'll just float away
And I'll forget every cynical thing you say
When you gonna hear me out
Man, you really bring me down

Hold on to hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
They say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

Reality will break your heart
Survival will not be the hardest part
It's keeping all your hopes alive
When all the rest of you has died
So let it break your heart

And hold on to hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody

Hold on to hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
They say that dreaming is free
I wouldn't care what it cost me

"Pool"

As if the first cut wasn't deep enough
I dove in again cause I'm not into giving up
Coulda got the same rush from any lover's touch
But why get used to something new
'Cause no one breaks my heart like you

When you kiss me I wish we could see what happens next
For a moment I could forget what happens in my head
If I doubt you will you come through, happy second chance
Or happy ending
This time you don't leave me sinking

I'm under water
No air in my lungs
My eyes are open
And I'm giving up
You are the wave
I could never tame
If I survive I'll dive back in

As if the first blood didn't thrill enough
I went further out to see what else was left of us
Never found the deep end of our little ocean
Drain the fantasy of you headfirst into shallow pools

And I wonder is it better to get it over with
The illusion can shatter before we begin
If you're really sorry, happy second chance
I think I could forgive
This time you won't leave me sinking

I'm under water
No air in my lungs
My eyes are open
And I'm giving up
You are the wave
I could never tame
If I survive I'll dive back in

Dive back into
Right back into
Dive right back into you
Now I know you
Now I know you
Now that I know you
Dive right back into you

Back into
Right back into you
Dive right back into you
Now I know you
Now I know you
Now that I know you
Dive right back into you

I'm under water
No air in my lungs
My eyes are open
And I'm giving up
You are the wave
I could never tame
If I survive I'll dive back in

I'm under water
No air in my lungs
My eyes are open
And I'm giving up
You are the wave
I could never tame
If I survive I'll dive back in
I'll dive back in
I'll dive back

"Grudges"

Strange how we found ourselves exactly where we left off
I know you're shaking my hand like it is the first time
Are we alright?
Are you recounting all my faults?
And are you racking your brain just to find them all?
Could it be that I've changed or did you?

Stop asking why
Why we had to waste so much time
Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again
'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges

Time is a bastard I won't break my neck to get around it
But aren't we so brave to give up a fight
And let the years go by without us
'Cause now I feel you by my side
And I don't even care if it's been a while
I can feel that we've changed and we're better this way

Stop asking why
Why we had to waste so much time
Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again
'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges

And if you wanna call me up or come over
Come on, we'll laugh 'till we cry
Like we did when we were kids
'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges

Why did it take so long?
Why did it take so long?
Why did it take us so long to just let it go?
Why did it take us so long to stop holding on?

Stop asking why
Why we had to waste so much time
Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again
'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges

And if you wanna call me up or come over
Come on we'll laugh till we cry
Like we did when we were kids
'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges

We can't keep holding on to grudges
Could it be that I've changed
Could it be that I've changed
Could it be that I've changed
Could it be that I've changed or did you?

"Caught In The Middle"

I can't think of getting old
It only makes me want to die
And I can't think of who I was
'Cause it just makes me want to cry, cry, cry, cry
Can't look back, can't look too far ahead
I got the point, I got the message

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
Gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah I'm caught in the middle

I was dreaming life away
All the while just going blind
Can't see the forest for the trees
Behind the lids of my own eyes
Nostalgia's cool, but it won't help you now
A dream is good, if you don't wear it out

And I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
Gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah I'm caught in the middle

No, I don't need no help
I can sabotage me by myself
Don't need no one else
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no help
I can sabotage me by myself
Don't need no one else
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no help (all the glory days are gone)
I can sabotage me by myself
Don't need no one else (it's over now I'm on my own)
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no help (all the glory days are gone)
I can sabotage me by myself
Don't need no one else (it's over now I'm on my own)
I can sabotage me by myself

And I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
Gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah I'm caught in the middle

I'm caught in the middle

"Idle Worship"

Standing here like I'm supposed to say something
Don't hold your breath, I never said I'd save you, honey
And I don't want your money
If I was you I'd run from me or rip me open
You'll see you're not the only one who's hopeless
Be sure to put your faith in something more
I'm just a girl and you're not as alone as you feel
We all got problems, don't we?
We all need heroes, don't we?
But rest assured there's not a single person here who's worthy

Don't let me let you down

Hey, baby I'm not your superhuman
And if that's what you want
I hate to let you down
I got your hopes up
Now I got you hoping
But I'm gonna be the one to let you down

Oh, it's such a long and awful lonely fall
Down from this pedestal that you keep putting me on
What if I fall on my face?
What if I make a mistake?
If it's okay a little grace would be appreciated
Remember how we used to like ourselves?
What little light that's left, we need to keep it sacred
I know that you're afraid to let all the dark escape you
But we could let the light illuminate these hopeless places

Just let me let you down

Hey, baby I'm not your superhuman
And if that's what you want
I hate to let you down
I got your hopes up
Now I got you hoping
But I'm gonna be the one to let you down

Oh, no, I ain't your hero
You're wasting all your faith on me
Oh, no, I know where this goes
Think it's safe to say your savior doesn't look a thing like me

Don't let me let you down

Hey, baby I'm not your superhuman
And if that's what you want
I hate to let you down
I got your hopes up
Now I got you hoping
But I'm gonna be the one to let you down

Hey, baby I'm not your superhuman
And if that's what you want
I hate to let you down
I got your hopes up
Now I got you hoping
But I'm gonna be the one to let you down

"No Friend"
(feat. Aaron Weiss)

I found these old letters from years ago
I felt it was fitting to continue this correspondence
Can't help I'm sentimental
Thanks for talking with me today
Hope this is helpful for you
I also hope Birdie is happy and healthy
And staying out of trouble to a reasonable extent
What I wrote was sort of my way
Of finally being able to address how it feels

Another brick-red room, another black-top town
Another misspelled band burning their own houses down
Another pine-box tune to fill the cemetery day
Another star, a touch of orange over purgatory gray

Another thorny field to scatter fruitless seed
Another song that runs too long, God knows no one needs
More misguided ghosts, more transparent hands
To drop a nickel in our basket and we'll do our riot!

Dance beneath another burning sky, behind our painted lips
In scores of catatonic smile-covered ankle-bitten ships
So throw your pedestal of stone in the forgetful sea
As protection from the paper-thin perfection you project on me

When this repetition ends behind the window shades
A semi-conscious sorrow sleeping in the bed I've made
That most unrestful bed, that most original of sins
And you'll say that's what I get when I let ambition win again

I'd hate to let you down, so I'll let the waters rise
And drown my dull reflection in the naÃ¯ve expectation in your eyes
Back in a cast bit-part, back when I felt most free
I had a butcher's heart and no one thought they knew me

So before the regiment resumes, before the dreaded sun appears
My driver's waiting, so let's make one point crystal clear:
You see a flood-lit form, I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours, and you're no friend of mine

You're no friend of mine, you're no friend of mine
I'm no savior of yours, and you're no friend of mine
You see a flood-lit form, I see a shirt design
I'm no savior of yours, and you're no friend of mine

It's kind of hard to see myself in the reflection of people's eyes
Realizing what they see may not be even close to the image I see in myself
And I hate I might actually be more afraid
To let my own self down than anything else
I feel like the man in the story
Who saw a bear floating in the river and thought it was a fur coat
Twelve years ago I stood on the shore
Jumped in and grabbed the coat
And the river is rushing toward a waterfall
And my friend stood at the shore and shouted to let go of the coat and swim back to land
I let go of the coat but the coat won't let go of me
In any case please let me know if there's more I can give you
If nothing comes of it, then just know we are grateful

"Tell Me How"

I can't call you a stranger
But I can't call you
I know you think that I erased you
You may hate me, but I can't hate you
And I won't replace you

Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh oh oh oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go?

Think I'm tired of getting over it
And just starting something new again
I'm getting sick of the beginnings
And always coming to your defenses
I guess it's good to get it off my chest
I guess I can't believe I haven't yet
You know I got my own convictions
And they're stronger than any addiction
But no one's winning

Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh oh oh oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go?
Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh oh oh oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go?

Keep me up with your silence
Take me down with your quiet
Of all the weapons you fight with
Your silence is the most violent

Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh oh oh oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go?
Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh oh oh oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go?

You don't have to tell me
If you ever think of me
I know you see me dancing
Wildly in the fog of your memory
You don't have to tell me
I can still believe

"This Is Why"

If you have an opinion
Maybe you should shove it
Or maybe you could scream it
Might be best to keep it

To yourself (To yourself)
To yourself (To yourself)

This is why
I don't leave the house
You say the coast is clear
But you won't catch me out
Oh, why?
This is why

Better have conviction
'Cause we want crimes of passion
Survival of the fittest

So far
From a front line
Quite the opposite I'm safe inside

And I feel useless behind this computer
And that's just barely scratched the surface of my mind

"Running Out Of Time"

Said I was gonna take some flowers to my neighbor, but I
Ran out of time
Didn't wanna show up to the party empty-handed, but I
Ran out of time
Said I'd walk the dog a little further than the driveway tonight
The extra mile
Thought I'd send a card with my condolences, but, damn, I
Just ran out of time

Intentions only get you so far
What if I'm just a selfish prick? No regard

I, I'm always running out of time
I'm always running out of time

Never mind, I hit the snooze on my alarm twenty times
But I was just so tired
There was traffic, spilled my coffee, crashed my car, otherwise
Woulda been here on time
Shoulda, coulda, wouldn't matter, ultimate alibi
You know it's a lie
There was a fire (Metaphorically)
Be there in five (Hyperbolically)

Intentions only get you so far (It was on my list, I swear I meant to get to it)
A harsh reality to discover

I, I'm always running out of time
She's always running out of time
I'm always running out of time

Why we gotta be in a rush?
My watch is just for decoration (Mm)
Look, I showed up early for once
Now that's a new sensation (Mm)

We're always running out of time
She's always running out of time
I'm always running out of time
I'm always running out of time
She's always running out of time, out of time
I'm always running out of time

"Big Man, Little Dignity"

Don't mean to stare at you from across the room
It's like I'm glued to the sheer sight of you
And you're so smooth, it's pitiful
Know you could get away with anything
So that's exactly what you do

Big man, little dignity (Ooh-ooh)
Big man, little dignity (Ooh-ooh)
No offense but you
You got no integrity
Big man (Ooh)
Ooh, la-la-la little dignity

Well-well-well-well look at you
Don't you clean up nice?
Bet it feels good to leave the past behind
Your subscription to redemption has been renewed
You keep your head high
Smooth operator in a shit-stained suit

Big man, little dignity (Ooh-ooh)
Big man, little dignity (Ooh-ooh)
No offense but you
You got no integrity
Big man (Ooh)
Ooh, la-la-la little dignity

Oh, I can't look away

I memorized all your lies
I can't look away, you're like a movie that I love to hate
I fantasize your demise
I should look away because I know you're never gonna change
I keep thinking
This time the end will be different
But it isn't
I keep thinking (Keep thinking)
The end is gonna be different
But you keep on winning

"You First"

Living well is not my kind of revenge
You should take it from me
Living well is just a privilege
Thought I'd simmer down as I got older
Can't shake the devil sitting on my shoulder
Who invited you?

Just like a stray animal
I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy
And it keeps on coming back
Just like a stray animal
I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy
And it keeps on coming

Everyone is a bad guy
And there's no way, no way to know who's the worst
Karma's gonna come for all of us
And I hope, I hope, I just hope, she comes, comes for you first, oh

Which wolf wins?
I guess it really depends
Just gotta wait and see
Which one's appetite's the biggest
Turns out I'm living in a horror film
Where I'm both the killer and the final girl
So who, who are you?

Just like a stray animal
I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy
And it keeps on coming back
Just like a stray animal
I keep feeding scraps
I give it my energy
And it keeps on coming

Everyone is a bad guy
And there's no way, no way to know who's the worst
Karma's gonna come for all of us
And I hope, I hope, I just hope, she comes, comes for you first, oh

Never said I wasn't petty
Never said I wasn't petty

I never said I wasn't petty
You can bet I don't regret it for a second
It's a pleasure, it's a reckoning
Never said I wasn't petty
I'll do better when you're better
Let me revel in your defeat

Everyone is a bad guy
And there's no way, no way to know who's the worst
Karma's gonna come for all of us
And I hope, I hope, I just hope, she comes, comes for you first, oh

"Figure 8"

Drained me dry
Down to the last drop
Pearls before swine
All flowers die
Tapped the last good vein
Don't know how to shut it off

Yeah, once you get me going
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
Once you get me going
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to

All for your sake
Became the very thing that I hate
I lost my way
Spinning in an endless figure 8

I
Won't miss the feeling
My flimsy spine
Unsuspicious mind
I was only being kind
But you mistook me for weak

And once I get going
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to stop
Going
I don't know how to stop
I don't know how to

All for your sake
Became the very thing that I hate
I lost my way
Spinning in an endless figure 8

Candle light
Candle light
Burning 'til broad daylight
Candle light
Candle light
Burning at both ends tonight

How could I?
How could I?
If I'm made of thin ice
How could I?
How could I?
You'd be wise if you thought twice

All for your sake
Became the very thing that I hate
I lost my way
Spinning in an endless figure

What remains?
And now I think I'm losing my shape
Not a trace
No end and no beginning, figure 8

"Liar"

What was the moment? It's hard to say
I'm sure I don't remember anyway
Before I only knew to hesitate
Pin back in the grenade
And all the ways I'd keep you safe
I keep you safe
From me

And, oh my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth

I got too good at fighting chemicals
And dodging arrows I was asking for
Wading through the fog, and then it disappeared
Naked when I'm here
And why should I deny what's all at once so crystal clear?
(And why should I deny what's all at once so crystal clear?)

And, oh my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth

Love is not an easy thing to admit
But I'm not ashamed of it
Love is not a weakening
If you feel it rushing in
Don't be ashamed of it

Love is not an easy thing to admit
But I'm not ashamed of it
Love is not a weakening
If you feel it rushing in
Don't be ashamed of it

And, oh my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth

And, oh my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth

"Crave"

I can't wait to memorize this day
Oh, a picture could not contain
The way it feels
You say, "Live in the present."
I'm already dreaming of how it begins
And trying to savor the moment
But I know the feeling will come to an end

So I
Crave
Crave to do it again
All again
Crave
Crave to do it again, I
Just for a second it all felt simple
I'm already missing it
So I
Crave
Crave to do it again
All again

I romanticize even the worst of times
When all it took to make me cry
Was being alive
Look up and see a reflection of someone who never gave way to the pain
What if I told 'em, now that I'm older, there isn't a moment that I'd wanna change

Now I
Crave
Crave to do it again
All again
Crave
Crave to do it again, I
Just for a second it all felt simple
I'm already missing it
So I crave
Crave to do it again
All again

Any second
Feel the present
Future and the past
Connecting

Any second
Feel the present
Future and the past
Connecting

Crave
Crave, to do it again (Do it)
All again
Crave
Crave to do it again, I
Just for a second it all felt simple
I'm already missing it
So I crave
Crave to do it again
All again

"Thick Skull"

I am a magnet for broken pieces
I am attracted to broken people
I pick 'em up, and now my fingers are bleeding
And it looks like my fault
And it looks like I'm caught
Red-handed

Hit over the head
Epiphany
Over my head
Repeatedly
Thick skull never did
Nothing for me
Same lesson again?
Come on, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

Only I know where all the bodies are buried
Thought by now I'd find 'em just a little less scary
Might get easier, but you don't get used to it
Keep on autopilot, mmm
Hey, hey
What's the body count up to now, captain?

Hit over the head
Epiphany
Over my head
Repeatedly
Thick skull never did
Nothing for me
Same lesson again?
C'mon, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

Come on out with your hands up
Come on out with your hands up
I'm coming out with my hands up, mmm
Come on out with your hands up

Hit over the head
Epiphany
Over my head
Repeatedly
Thick skull never did
Nothing for me
Same lesson again?
C'mon, give it to me
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me

I pick 'em up and now my fingers are bleeding
And it looks like I'm caught

The energy I waste
Be better shared with you?

And, oh my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth

I got too good at fighting chemicals
And dodging arrows I was asking for
Wading through the fog, and then it disappeared
Naked when I'm here
I'm getting good at giving alibis
Imagination runs wild
No fear and self-doubt
Heart beating in my mouth
Now every time I catch my line
I want to set it free

Love is not an easy thing to admit
But I'm not ashamed of it
Love is not a weakening
If you feel it rushing in
Don't be ashamed of it

Oh, oh-oh
Love is not an easy thing to admit
But I'm not ashamed of it
Oh, oh-oh
Love is not a weakening
If you feel it rushing in
Don't be ashamed of it

And, oh my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh my love, I lied to you
But I never needed to
Oh my love, I lied to you
But you always knew the truth

"Crave (Re: Claud)"

I can't wait to memorize this day
Oh, a picture could not contain
The way it feels
You say, "Live in the present"
I'm already dreaming of how it begins
And trying to savor the moment
But I know the feeling will come to an end

So I
Crave
Crave to do it again
All again
Crave
Crave to do it again, I
Just for a second, it all felt simple
I'm already missing it
So I
Crave
Crave to do it again
All again

I romanticize even the worst of times
When all it took to make me cry
Was being alive
Look up and see a reflection of someone who never gave way to the pain
What if I told 'em that now that I'm older, there isn't a moment that I'd wanna change

Now I
Crave
Crave to do it again
All again
Crave
Crave to do it again, I
Just for a second, it all felt simple
I'm already missing it
So I crave
Crave to do it again
All again

Any second
Feel the present
Future and the past
Connecting

Any second
Feel the present
Future and the past
Connecting

Crave
Crave, to do it again
All again
Crave
Crave to do it again, I
Just for a second, it all felt simple
I'm already missing it
So I crave
Crave to do it again
All again

"Thick Skull (Re: Julien Baker)"

I am a magnet for broken pieces
I am attracted to broken people
I pick 'em up and now my fingers are bleeding
And it looks like I'm
And it looks like I'm caught
Red-handed

Hit over the head
Epiphany
Over my head
Repeatedly
Thick skull never did
Nothing for me
Same lesson again?
Come on, give it to me

Only I know where all the bodies are buried
Thought by now I'd find 'em just a little less scary
Might get easier, but you don't get used to it
Keep on autopilot
What's the body count up to now, captain?

Hit over the head
Epiphany
Over my head
Repeatedly
Thick skull never did
Nothing for me
Same lesson again?
Come on, give it to me

I pick 'em up and now my fingers are bleeding
And it looks like I'm caught
Red-handed

Come on out with your hands up
Come on out with your hands up
I'm coming out with my hands up
Coming out with your hands up

Hit over the head
Epiphany
Over my head
Repeatedly
Thick skull never did
Nothing for me
Same lesson again?
Come on, give it to me

"Sanity (Demo)"

Sanity, why must you make a fool of me?
You been a friend to me, now I think that we're enemies, yeah, yeah

If I fall on my knees, I hear you laughin'
If I call on your name, you don't come

No one home, but the void is loud
This must be the void
Echoes around my empty house
This must be the void
Synapses are slowin' down
But this must be the void they always talk about
This must be the void

Levity, fill me up, let me flow
I'll let you take care of me, you can help me let go

If I fall on my knees, I hear you laughin'
If I call on your name, you don't come

No one home, but the void is loud
This must be the void
Echoes around my empty house
This must be the void
Synapses are slowin' down
But this must be the void they always talk about
No one home, but the void is loud
This must be the void
Echoes around my empty house
This must be the void
Synapses are slowin' down
But this must be the void they always talk about
This must be the void

Finally, I have arrived
Finally, I have arrived
And there is nothin' to see
Finally, I have arrived
And there is nothin' to grieve
Finally, I have arrived, arrived, arrived, 'rived

No one home, but the void is loud
This must be the void
Echoes around my empty house
This must be the void
Synapses are slowin' down
But this must be the void they always talk about
This must be the void
No one home, but the void is loud
This must be the void
Echoes around my empty house
This must be the void
Synapses are slowin' down
But this must be the void they always talk about
This must be the void

"Adore"

I don't mean to run
But every time you come around I feel
More alive, than ever
And I guess it's too much
Maybe we're too young
And I don't even know what's real
But I know I've never wanted anything so bad
I've never wanted anyone so bad

If I let you love me
Be the one adored
Would you go all the way?
Be the one I'm looking for?
If I let you love me, (If I say,)
Be the one adored, (It's okay,)
Would you go all the way? (Stay,)
Be the one I'm looking for?

Help me come back down
From high above the clouds
You know I'm suffocating
But I blame this town
Why do I deny
The things that burn inside
Down deep I'm barely breathing
But you just see a smile
And I don't wanna let this go
Really, I just want to know

If I let you love me
Be the one adored
Would you go all the way?
Be the one I'm looking for?
If I let you love me, (If I say,)
Be the one adored, (It's okay,)
Would you go all the way? (Stay,)
Be the one I'm looking for?

If I let you love me
Be the one adored
Would you go all the way?
Be the one I'm looking for?

If I let you love me
Be the one adored
Would you go all the way?
Be the one I'm looking for?
If I let you love me, (If I say,)
Be the one adored, (It's okay,)
Would you go all the way? (Stay,)
Be the one I'm looking for?

"Another Day"

And if you're listening, I miss you
And if you hear me now, I need you

Where did you go?
'Cause you're not gone
Everyone knows that something's wrong
The wires were cut and I'm alone

I know we're getting closer
I know you're coming back for me this time
This time

And do you ever want me, do you ever need me?
I know that you left before goodbye
And it's okay, there's always another day
And anytime you want me, anytime you see me
I don't think you meant to say goodbye
But it's okay, there's always another day

Your voice comes in and now it's fading
I can't believe this is so frustrating
'Cause you never seem to understand
And you let me slip straight through your hands
And how does it feel to be alone?

I know we're getting closer
I know you're coming back for me this time
This time

And do you ever want me, do you ever need me?
I know that you left before goodbye
And it's okay, there's always another day
And anytime you want me, anytime you see me
I don't think you meant to say goodbye
And it's okay, there's always another day

If you ever find what you were looking for
I will be waiting there, I will be there

And do you ever want me, do you ever need me?
I know that you left before goodbye
And it's okay, there's always another day
And anytime you want me, anytime you see me
I don't think you meant to say goodbye
But it's okay, there's always another day

"Brand New Eyes Tour Intro"
(Live)

So your father told you once
That you were his princess
You don't see the castle
And you cannot find your prince

And now you've grown a lot
And your dresses don't fit right
Your daddy's not a hero
He stole your chariot

So here you are in pieces
Trying to prove to us it's real
The softness of your smile
And the lies you want to feel

The scales beneath your skin
Are showing off today
There's evil in your heart
And it wants out to play

There's evil in your heart
And it wants out to play
There's evil in your heart

And I made a home here for me
Don't burn it down with your fantasies
And I made a home here for me
Don't burn it down with your fantasies

"Breathe (Until Tomorrow)"

I climb, I slip, I fall
Reaching for your hands
But I lay here all alone
Sweating all your blood

If I could find out how
To make you listen now
Because I'm starving for you here
With my undying love
And I, I will

Breathe for love tomorrow
Cause there's no hope for today
Breathe for love tomorrow
Cause maybe there's another way

I climb, I slip, I fall
Reaching for your hands
But I lay here all alone
Sweating all your blood

If I could find out how
To make you listen now
Because I'm starving for you here
With my undying love
And I, I will

Breathe for love tomorrow
Cause there's no hope for today
Breathe for love tomorrow
Cause maybe there's another way

Breathe for love tomorrow
Cause there's no hope for today
Breathe for love tomorrow
Cause maybe there's another way

I climb, I slip, I fall
Into your empty hands
But I lay here all alone
Sweating all your blood

"Evil In Your Heart"

Don't burn it down with your fantasies

"Hello Cold World"

I feel happy, I feel sad, I feel like running through the walls
I'm overjoyed, I'm undecided, I don't know who I am
Well maybe I'm not perfect, at least I'm working on it
22 is like the worst idea that I've ever had
It's too much pain, it's too much freedom, what should I do with this?
It's not the way you plan it, it's how you make it happen
Yeah, it's how you make it happen

It's such a cold, cold world (hello cold world)
And I can't get out, so I'll just make the best of everything I'll never have
It's such a cold, cold world (hello cold world)
And it's got me down, but I'll get right back up, as long as it spins around
Hello cold world
Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh

Girls and boys keep lining up to see if they can measure up
They look good, and they feel wild, but it will never be enough
You say you're really hurting, at least you're feeling something
We can hope and we can pray that everything will work out fine
But you can't just stay down on your knees, the revolution is outside
You wanna make a difference, get out and go begin it
Whoa, get out and go begin it

It's such a cold, cold world (hello cold world)
And I can't get out, so I'll just make the best of everything I'll never have
It's such a cold, cold world (hello cold world)
And it's got me down, but I'll get right back up, as long as it spins around
Hello cold world

Oh oh
(Oh oh...) Don't need my eyes open... wide
(Oh oh...) I just wanna feel something

Such a cold, cold world (hello cold world)
And I can't get out, so I'll just make the best of everything I'll never have
It's such a cold, cold world (hello cold world)
And it's got me down, but I'll get right back up, as long as it spins around (spins around)
Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh (Hello cold world)
Whoa oh oh
Whoa oh oh (Hello cold world)

"Hello Hello"

Hello, hello?
Is anyone home?
Hello, hello?
Just pick up the phone

I opened up my life to you
I told you everything I knew
You listened so closely to
You listened so close when love was just a way out
But you're going deaf now
Yeah you turned your head around

Hello, hello?
Is anyone home?
Hello, hello?
Just pick up the phone
You'll be sorry to hear
I'm doing fine now
Sorry to hear
You're without me now

You blew up the world I built for us
Destroyed our secret universe
Threw out the trust I, put in you
Making me feel like I'd been used
And now I'm reminded
That I was just blinded

Hello, hello?
Is anyone home?
Hello, hello?
Just pick up the phone
You'll be sorry to hear
I'm doing fine now
Sorry to hear
You're without me now

I'm doing fine
You'll be alright
Maybe you'll think of me tonight
You're doing fine
And I'll be alright
Just give me time, yeah

Hello, hello?
Is anyone home?
Hello, hello?
Just pick up the phone
I don't wanna hear
You're doing fine now
Don't wanna hear
I'm without you now

I'm without you now
I'm without you

"I Caught Myself"
(from "Twilight" soundtrack)

Down to you
You're pushing and pulling me down to you
But I don't know what I
Now when I caught myself
I had to stop myself
From saying something
That I should've never thought
Now when I caught myself
I had to stop myself
From saying something
That I should've never thought of you of you

You're pushing and pulling me down to you
But I don't know what I want
No, I don't know what I want

You got it you got it
Some kind of magic
Hypnotic hypnotic
You're leaving me breathless
I hate this I hate this
You're not the one I believe in
With God as my witness

Now when I caught myself
I had to stop myself
From saying something
That I should've never thought
Now when I caught myself
I had to stop myself
From saying something
That I should've never thought of you of you

You're pushing and pulling me down to you
But I don't know what I want
No, I don't know what I want

Don't know what I want
But I know it's not you
Keep pushing and pulling me down
When I know in my heart it's not you

Now when I caught myself
I had to stop myself
I'm saying something
That I should've never thought
Now when I caught myself
I had to stop myself
I'm saying something
That I should've never thought of you

I knew, I know in my heart it's not you
I knew, but now I know what I want, I want, I want
Oh no, I should have never thought

"In The Mourning"

You escaped like a runaway train
Off the tracks and down again
And my heart's beating like a steam boat tugging all your burdens
On my shoulders

And in the mourning I'll rise
In the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning, all my worries

And now there's nothing but time that's wasted
And words that have no backbone
And now it seems like the whole world's waiting
Can you hear the echoes fading?

In the mourning I'll rise
In the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning, all my sorries

And it takes all my strength not to dig you up
From the ground in which you lay
The biggest part of me
You were the greatest thing
And now you're just a memory
To let go of

And in the mourning I'll rise
And in the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning, all my sorries

In the mourning I'll rise
In the mourning I'll let you die
In the mourning, all my sorries

"Just Like Me"

I slipped down the stairs
Tripped over your fragile ego
I slid down the hallway
Right into the web you'd woven

And you never said
That you meant to save someone
Somebody just like me
And you never told me
You wanted to love someone
Somebody just like me

You locked all the doors
You felt it was safer that way
You put up a wall
And now your whole world is caving in

And you never said
That you meant to save someone
Somebody just like me
And you never told me
You wanted to love someone
Somebody just like me

You swallow your pride as
You left behind
Counting stars to name your lies
You let the rain
Push you away
And now you're drowning in the waves

Yeah
And you never said
That you meant to save someone
Somebody just like me
And you never told me
You wanted to love someone
Somebody just like me

And you never told me
You wanted to love someone
Somebody just like
Somebody just like me
And you never said
That you meant to save someone
Like me
Somebody just like me

"Monster"
(from "Transformers: Dark of the Moon" soundtrack)

You were my conscience
So solid, now you're like water
And we started drowning
Not like we'd sink any farther

But I let my heart go
It's somewhere down at the bottom
But I'll get a new one
And come back for the hope that you've stolen

I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world from turning into a monster eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder how we survive?
Well, now that you're gone, the world is ours

Ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah, ah

I'm only human
I've got a skeleton in me
But I'm not the villain
Despite what you're always preaching

Call me a traitor
I'm just collecting your victims
And they're getting stronger
I hear them calling, calling, calling

I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world from turning into a monster eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder how we survive?
Well, now that you're gone, the world is ours

Well, you find your strength in solutions
But I like the tension
And not always knowing the answers
But you're gonna lose it
You're gonna lose it

I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world from turning into a monster eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder how we survive?
Well, now that you're gone, the world

I'll stop the whole world
I'll stop the whole world from turning into a monster eating us alive
Don't you ever wonder how we survive?
Now that you're gone, the world is ours

"My Number One"

You're my number one (you're my number one)
You're my golden star
I look at Earth from here
Still you don't seem so far

But you will never know
(You will never know)
Oh you will never know

Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
Oh, I would never admit that I
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
Oh, I would never admit that I
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
Oh, I would never admit that I
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh

Do you think of me?
Do you wonder
If we could ever be residing under

Because we will never know
(We will never know)
Until I see you show through

Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
Oh, I would never admit that I
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
Oh, I would never admit that I
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
Oh, I would never admit that I
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh

I
I wish I could tell you how I feel
And show you what's inside of me is real
Don't know what I'm waiting for
Can't explain it anymore, yeah

Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
Oh, I would never admit that I
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
No, I would never admit that I
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
Oh, I would never admit that I
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh

I
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
And I love
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
I love
Oh oh oh oh ooh oh oh
I love you

"Oh Father (Outro)"

Oh father
Oh father
Oh father
Oh father! [or "My Jesus!"]

Father, well I'm ready
Won't you let it begin?
'Cause I'm here now
I want to dance in the mighty palm of your hand

"Renegade"

And the grass wasn't green enough here
After watering it with my tears
I'm not sure where you went
Now we are just past tense

And the snakes, they are slithering in
Chasing me to my end
I can't say where that is
I'm running again

And when I get there
It won't be far enough
I'm a renegade
It's in my blood
If ever I get there
It won't be fast enough
I'm a renegade
I always was

And the spark never lit up a fire
Though I tried and tried and tried
The wind came from your lungs
A hurricane from your tongue

And I'll keep your secrets with me
Right behind my teeth
Your anger, your anchor
But I'll sail much further on, on, on

And when I get there
It won't be far enough
I'm a renegade
It's in my blood
If ever I get there
It won't be fast enough
I'm a renegade
I always was

I'll keep running
I'll keep running again, keep running
I'll keep running, running, running
Keep running, running, running

I'll keep running
I'll keep running again, keep running
I'll keep running, running, running
Keep running, running, running

And when I get there
It won't be far enough
I'm a renegade
It's in my blood
If ever I get there
It won't be fast enough
I'm a renegade
It's in my blood

I'm a renegade
I always was

"Stay Away"

Your lies are bleeding through your teeth
Your eyes see only one thing in me
Your promises never really meant a thing
But they flowed from your lips so easily

Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay away from me
Stay, stay, stay, stay away
Stay, stay, stay, stay away from me
Stay, stay, stay, stay away, away 

It's my best at your heart
The glass that rips your word apart
Is it the guilt that keeps you up at night when you're in bed?
Well you can sleep sound honey, I'll write you a check

Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay away from me
Stay, stay, stay, stay away
Stay, stay, stay, stay away from me
Stay, stay, stay, stay away, away 

I never was too good with goodbyes
You made it easy when your glee presided
With all the evil that you've provided
You still put the "good" in "goodbye"
In goodbye, in goodbye

Stay away, stay, stay, stay away from me
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay away from me
Stay, stay, stay, stay away from me
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay away from me

"Swim In Silence"

Meet me here beneath the burning skies
Where the ocean comes and takes us from all of our lives
You never said that you were coming back
I have waited although I have found the place you hide

What keeps you so far away?

We can swim in silence
You can pull me under
I will not come up for anyone
I can slowly sink and
Watch you as you leave but
I will drown until you care

I will drown until you care

I imagine what it must be like
To have everything you need and not be satisfied
Run the water 'til it burns
And you can't see through the waves that crash into your pride

What keeps you so far away?

We can swim in silence
You can pull me under
I will not come up for anyone
I can slowly sink and
Watch you as you leave but
I will drown until you care

Going under
Going under

Getting close to what we cannot recognize
Floating face down in the lies
Here we are without a trace
Oh, but the lies we used to blame
And you're so far away

What keeps you so far away?

We can swim in silence
You can pull me under
I will not come up for anyone
I can slowly sink and
Watch you as you leave but
I will drown until you care

I will drown until you care

We can swim in silence
You can pull me under
I will not come up for anyone

We can swim in silence
You can pull me under
I will not come up for anyone

(Yeah, whoa, yeah)

I will drown until you care

"Throwing Punches"

There's an empty room
At the end of the hall
And it's begging to
Swallow you whole

Each step you take
Makes it easier to
Fall on your face
Each tear you fake
Makes it easier to
See straight through you, now

And you're so hateful sometimes
Throwing punches and lies
Fall from somewhere above
Just to say you're in love

So you hang yourself
From stolen dreams
And under the table, you hide
Every stain

Each step you take
(Getting closer)
Makes it easier to
Fall on your face
Each death you fake
(Getting closer)
Makes it easier to
Live this way
Hey, now

And you're so hateful sometimes
Throwing punches and lies
Fall from somewhere above
Just to say you're in love

Watch it disappear
The dream you hold so dear
Let it fade
(Let it fade)
Let it fade
(Let it fade)
Let it fade
(Let it fade)
Now

And you're so hateful sometimes
Throwing punches and lies
Fall from somewhere above
Just to say you're in love

And you're so hateful sometimes
Throwing punches and lies
Fall from somewhere above
Just to say you're in love

Just to say you're in love
