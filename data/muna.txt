"Loudspeaker"

What you want from me
Is all of my time wasted on you
Trying to teach me a lesson
Well baby I learned one thing from you
You can try to be my hell, to be my beating
But every time I love myself, it hurts your feelings

So if I feel real good tonight
I'm gonna put it high on the loudspeaker
And if I feel like crying, I won't hide it
I am a loudspeaker
I am a loudspeaker
I am a loudspeaker

What you've done to me
Well I've seen many a friend be silenced
Thinking nobody would believe them
Well baby you've got another thing coming
You can try to make me stop, call it delusion
But every time I don't shut up, it's revolution

So if I feel real good tonight
I'm gonna put it high on the loudspeaker
And if I feel like crying, I won't hide it
I am a loudspeaker
I am a loudspeaker
I am a loudspeaker

I don't know where the blame lies
But you better believe I'm not gonna carry it all
I don't know where the shame dies
But it's helping me to scream this is not my fault
I don't know where the blame lies
But you better believe I'm not gonna carry it all
I don't know where the shame dies
But it's helping me to scream this is not my fault
I don't know where the blame lies
But you better believe I'm not gonna carry it all
I don't know where the shame dies
But it's helping me to scream this is not my fault
But it's helping me to scream
Not, not my fault

So if I feel real good tonight
I'm gonna put it high on the loudspeaker
If I feel like crying, I won't hide it
I am a loudspeaker

"So Special"

There's a few bad things I've done
That nobody made me do
Most just to get myself off
And the rest to get over you
Meant the things you said
Turns out I had no idea
You'd ever tell me we were done
Or what that would feel like to hear

Now I know I'm not so special
Cause I'm all dressed up
And you think that I'm beautiful
But it's not enough
Now I know I'm not so special
Cause I'm all dressed up
And you think that I'm beautiful
But it's not enough

Guess I'm gonna find another ride
Guess I'll see you in another life
Guess I'm gonna tell one more lie
I'm surprised you don't wanna stay by my side

I think about the time
And I went down on you in the gallery
And I was always out of line
But I thought you were right there with me

Now I know I'm not so special
Cause you're all dressed up
And I think you're so beautiful
But I'm not your love

Guess I'll never find another ride
Guess I'll see you in another life
Guess I'm gonna tell one more lie
I'm surprised you don't wanna stay by my side

Guess I'm gonna find another ride
Guess I'll see you in another life
Guess I'm gonna tell one more lie
I'm surprised you don't wanna stay by my side

"Winterbreak"

You say I'd best be going cause it's getting late
And I say
Why don't I walk you home cause it's on the way
But the last time
That we made love, you left in tears
So this time
You're wondering how to leave it here
And I haven't seen you since last winter break
And I know that I broke your heart
But always such a smart one, always so intelligent
You must know that I took it hard

Oh, baby I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try
Oh, baby, I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try

You pull
That face like, 'here we go again'
So I pull
A flask out the back of my jeans
And then you take a pull
And in my mind we're in my bed
And I'm pulling
Your sweater up over your head
And I haven't seen you since last winter break
And I know that you hate how that went
But always such a smart one, always so intelligent
You must know what's happening

Oh, baby I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try
Oh, baby, I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try

Oh it's magnetic, isn't it?
The sense of something underneath the surface
When you're laying on thin ice
Just a little bit masochistic
A tentative ellipses
The parting of your lips and the ache in your eyes
But I think I'm gonna kiss you

All despite
What we both know

This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try
Oh, baby, I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try

"Promise"

I told a lot of lies
And called it a compromise
To keep you in your seat
I was so afraid to lose
But the things that I did to you
You would never do to me

Why do I
Why do I do it
Why do I do it
You wanna
Hold my hand I make a fist
A false promise
And even if you said you would forgive me
I don't know if I could ever say I'm sorry

I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can
I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can

So I look at you now
Bruised and broken down
By what you thought was love
You tell me you want to stay
And you wanna watch me change
But I'm scared so I tell you to fuck off

Why do I
Why do I do it
Why do I do it
You wanna
Hold my hand I make a fist
A false promise
And even if you said you would forgive me
I don't know if I could ever say I'm sorry

I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can
I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can

Mean hearted girls will kill their loves to hurt themselves
They can't believe that they deserve anything else
And even if you said you know that I'm sorry
I don't know if I could ever forgive me

I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can
I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can

I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can
I don't know if I-

I don't know if I can

"I Know A Place"

I knew
When you told me you don't wanna go home tonight
And you tried to just shrug it off when I asked you why
Somebody hurt you
Somebody hurt you
But you're here by my side
And I knew
'Cause I can recall when I was the one in your seat
I still got the scars and they occasionally bleed
Cause somebody hurt me
Somebody hurt me
But I'm staying alive

And I can tell
When you get nervous
You think being yourself
Means being unworthy
And it's hard to love
With a heart that's hurting
But if you want to go out dancing

I know a place (ooh)
I know a place we can go (yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Just give me trust and watch what'll happen
'Cause I know (ooh)
I know a place we can run (yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Don't you be afraid of love and affection
Just lay down your weapon

Right now
It's like you're carrying all the weight of your past
I see all your bruises, yellow, dark blue, and black
But baby a bruise is, only your body
Tryna keep you intact
So right now
I think we should go get drunk on cheap wine
I think we should hop on the purple line
'Cause maybe our purpose
Is to never give up when we're on the right track

And I can tell
When you get nervous
You think being yourself
Means being unworthy
And it's hard to love
With a heart that's hurting
But if you want to go out dancing

I know a place (ooh)
I know a place we can go (yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Just give me trust and watch what'll happen
'Cause I know (ooh)
I know a place we can run (yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Don't you be afraid of love and affection
Just lay down your weapon
(Lay down your weapon)

They will try to make you unhappy
Don't let them
They will try to tell you you're not free
Don't listen
I, I know a place where you don't need protection
Even if it's only in my imagination
I, I know a place we can go
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Just give me trust and anything can happen

'Cause I know (ooh)
I know a place we can go (yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Just give me trust and watch what'll happen
'Cause I know (ooh)
I know a place we can stay (yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Don't you be afraid of love and affection

"Around U"

I would swear I'd never plan again
But I can see the irony
I'm humbled by the passing of time
I am brought down onto my knees
An Arizona half and half
A half a pack of cigarettes
A vacant lot, my tangled thoughts
Suburbia give me my God again

All senses say, nothing has changed
The soft lines from the streetlights fall the same on my face

But something massive happened here
I can feel it in the atmosphere
Something false that once was true
I no longer revolve around you
I no longer revolve around you

And the house still stands where it was built
I know 'cause I drove by tonight
A candle in the bedroom
Where I once performed a holy rite
And I did stop to hang my head
Just for a moment at the light
'Cause now the altar is a bed
And now you're just a friend that once was mine

Oh civilian, idling along
How can you understand that there's a whole world gone wrong?

But something massive happened here
Can you feel it in the atmosphere?
Something false that once was true
I no longer revolve around you
I no longer revolve around you

How can I try to be civilized
When inside there is a shift in paradigm
And everything we built, we built on our love
Everything spinning on one assumption
How can I try to say sorry
When my words don't carry the same gravity
And everything I say, I say it knowing
Full well you still don't want to believe

Something massive happened here
But you can feel it in the atmosphere
Something false that once was true
I no longer revolve around you

Something massive happened here
But you can feel it in the atmosphere
Something false that once was true
I no longer revolve around you
I no longer revolve around you

"After"

It comes on slow but
It leaves much faster
We need something to hold us
During and after

Is it all alright?
Is it all alright?
Is it all alright now?
Is it all alright?

After the beauty
After the sunrise
After the come down
After the big fight
I am asking

Is it all alright? (Even if it is not)
Is it all alright? (Even if it is not)
Is it all alright now? (Even if it is not)
Is it all alright? (Even if it is not)

It feels like a dream, what happened last night
In the morning I am waiting in a long, long line
I felt so connected, I felt so high
I am going to be lonely for a long, long time

And it's all alright (Even if it is not)
And it's all alright (Even if it is not)
And it's all alright now (Even if it is not)
And it's all alright (Even if it is not)

"Promise"

I told a lot of lies
And called it a compromise
To keep you in your seat
I was so afraid to lose
But the things that I did to you
You would never do to me

Why do I
Why do I do it
Why do I do it
You wanna
Hold my hand I make a fist
A false promise
And even if you said you would forgive me
I don't know if I could ever say I'm sorry

I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can
I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can

So I look at you now
Bruised and broken down
By what you thought was love
You tell me you want to stay
And you wanna watch me change
But I'm scared so I tell you to fuck off

Why do I
Why do I do it
Why do I do it
You wanna
Hold my hand I make a fist
A false promise
And even if you said you would forgive me
I don't know if I could ever say I'm sorry

I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can
I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can

Mean hearted girls will kill their loves to hurt themselves
They can't believe that they deserve anything else
And even if you said you know that I'm sorry
I don't know if I could ever forgive me

I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can
I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can

I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can
I don't know if I-
(You said you would)
I don't know if I can

I told a lot of lies
And called it a compromise
To keep you
(You said you would)

"If U Love Me Now"

I could read your mind
I know what you're thinking
This is not what you signed up for
I could pray to God
But I'm not invested
And you get what you pay for

I've been trying to find out if anyone
Feels truly happy because of all that they have done
'Cause I always seem to want more
Provided that I can get some

There's me in the corner throwing a fit
Making a mess of it
Don't you love me now?
There's me under the table, hiding from my
Lovers and my allies
Don't you love me now?
It's just a hypothesis or test, that I should not exist
Don't you love me now?
There's me in the doorway telling you please
You should just let me leave
If you love me now

I could bite my tongue
Trying not to say that my love
For you looks different
I could bide my time
Hoping I can fix it
But it goes against my instincts

And I've been trying to find out if anyone
Feels super sure that they are deserving of someone
'Cause I always seem to give it up
Provided that I can get some

There's me in the corner throwing a fit
Making a mess of it
Don't you love me now?
There's me under the table hiding from my
Lovers and my allies
Don't you love me now?
It's just a hypothesis or test, that I should not exist
Don't you love me now?
There's me in the doorway telling you please
You should just let me leave
If you love me now

It's just a hypothesis or test, that I should not exist
Don't you love me now
There's me in the doorway telling you please
You should just let me leave
If you love me now

"Crying On The Bathroom Floor"

Give me that diamond ring
Give me that love on the movie screen
And I won't feel a thing
Promise I won't feel a thing
Give me that kiss goodnight
Give me that gold, tell me it's alright
And I won't feel a thing
Promise I won't feel a thing

And I guess that I got rewired
'Cause you're cold as ice but it feels like fire, fire, fire, fire
And the drugs don't work and I don't know why
But when you hurt me I go higher, higher, higher, higher

But when I'm crying on the bathroom floor
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could never ask for more
If I'm never gonna ask for more from a lover
Crying on the bathroom floor
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could never ask for more
If I'm never gonna ask for more from a lover

Give me your disrespect
Give me your pain and loneliness
And I'll love you the best
Promise I'll love you the best
Give me no peace of mind
Give me distress, give me all your lies
And I'll love you for life
Promise I'll love you 'til I die

But I'm crying on the bathroom floor
(Give me some more)
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could ever ask for more
(Would you give me some more)
If I'm never gonna ask for more from a lover
Crying on the bathroom floor
(Give me some more)
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could never ask for more
(Would you give me some more)
If I'm never gonna ask for more from a lover

It's asking a lot of myself
I'm asking a lot of myself
It's taking a lot out of me, loving you
It's taking a lot out of me, loving you
Asking a lot of myself
I'm asking a lot of myself
It's taking a lot out of me, loving you
There isn't a lot that I think I can do

I'm crying on the bathroom floor
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could ever ask for more
(Would you give me some more)
If I'm never gonna ask for more from a lover
Crying on the bathroom floor
(Give me some more)
Tearing off the dress I wore, I wonder
If I could never ask for more
(Would you give me some more)
If I'm never gonna ask for more from a lover

"End Of Desire"

Oh God, save me
I want an impossible thing
I want to be free of this ache, of this need
I want not to want anything
Someone said, "God is here tonight"
Said they saw her outside getting high
Turn your head to the side
Hold your gaze against mine
And there it is
A mark of the divine

Are you taking me to the end of desire? (end of desire)
Are you taking me home? (taking me home)
Are you taking me home? (taking me home)
Are you taking me to the end of desire? (end of desire)
Are you taking me home? (taking me home)
Are you taking me home? (taking me home)

I am consumed
All my nights I think only of you
Taking all I have left
In exchange for a death
That is painless
That will make me new

Are you taking me to the end of desire? (end of desire)
Are you taking me home? (taking me home)
Are you taking me home? (taking me home)
Are you taking me to the end of desire? (end of desire)
Are you taking me home? (taking me home)
Are you taking me home? (taking me home)

Deep down I know
I am worshiping a false idol
Deep down I know
It's a false hope
But I won't let go of this feeling
Like I've got something to believe in
Like your love can maybe make me whole

My love, are you taking me home?

Are you taking me to the end of desire? (end of desire)
Are you taking me home? (taking me home)
Are you taking me home? (taking me home)
Are you taking me to the end of desire? (end of desire)
Are you taking me home? (taking me home)
Are you taking me home? (taking me home)

My love, are you taking me home?

"Everything"

I saw a beautiful girl on the street
She looked nothing like me, I think
But I wanted to call you
And tell you about
The way that her hair got caught in her mouth

I saw the wing of a bird on the road
It was early, I was walking alone
And I found it lovely
And I found it sad
I don't know how you'd find it but I wanted to ask

Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you

And at the bar, on TV
They were talking about the casualties
Four hundred and counting
And my only question
Was, how would you feel if one was me?

Would you wish we'd made love again?
Would you want to revisit the marks on my skin?
'Cause the world could be burning
And all I'd be thinking is
"How are you doing, baby?"

Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you

I'm sorry to be so serious
I know you don't like my long face
I am only here to tell you
That I am eviscerated
I'm sorry to be so serious
I know you can't stand me this way
But I took hope in half-desire
You are wildfire and I'm standing in the rain

After everything, everything, everything, everything, everything, everything

Everything's about you to me (it's about you to me)
Everything's about you to me (about you to me)
Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you

Everything's about you to me
Everything's about you

"Outro"

(Why do I do it, why do I)

What happened then, happened then
There's no use in recap
You said that you gave your best
And you think maybe it's time
But how long do you plan
To keep me in the back of your mind
For someday, maybe next time, oh

I start to cry
You're reaching out
I let you in, you're leaving now
I scream, "This is not the end!"
Cause I could
And you hurt me 'cause you should
Yeah, you should
I said "try," I thought we could
I thought we could
You said you would

"Grow"

I want to grow up
I want to put away my childish things
I think that I'm ready to
Take this song off repeat
I want to grow up
I'm tried of the party games
I'm calling their bluff
They always turn out the same

And I want to grow up
I want to grow old
I want to lay down
I want to let go

I want to grow
I want to grow

"Number One Fan"

So I heard the bad news
Nobody likes me and I'm gonna die alone
In my bedroom
Looking at strangers on my telephone
Well, wouldn't you?
Wouldn't you like if I believed those words?
If I'm born to lose
I'll never try and I will never learn, but

I've been looking at myself in the mirror, saying
"Don't leave me now, don't leave me now"
I've been looking at myself in the mirror, saying
"Don't leave me now," and I turn around like

"Oh my God, like, I'm your number one fan
So iconic, like big, like stan, like
I would give my life just to hold your hand
I'm your number one fan
I'm your number one, number one fan"

So here's the bad news
I'm coming for everyone and I'm coming on strong
New hair and new shoes
Yeah, I get what I like because I do what I want

I've been looking at myself in the mirror, saying
"Don't leave me now, don't leave me now"
I've been looking at myself in the mirror, saying
"Don't leave me now," and I turn around like

"Oh my God, like, I'm your number one fan
So iconic, like big, like stan, like
I would give my life just to hold your hand
I'm your number one fan
I'm your number one, number one fan"

Number one, number one
Number one, number one

In the thick of it
Will you stick up for me?
In the thick of it
Are you gonna believe that I can do it?
Love me in the way that only you can
Be my number one, number one

"Oh my God, like, I'm your number one fan
So iconic, like big, like stan, like
I would give my life just to hold your hand
I'm your number one fan
I'm your number one, number one fan
Oh my God, like, I'm your number one fan
So iconic, like big, like stan, like
I would give my life just to hold your hand
I'm your number one fan
I'm your number one, number one fan"

Number one, number one

"Stayaway"

If I see my old friends, we'll go out dancing
If we go out dancing, then we'll go to the bar
If we go to the bar, then there's gonna be drinking
If I drink, I wanna see where you are
So I don't see my old friends, I don't go dancing
I don't do most things I used to do
Actually, now that I'm thinking about it
I did most things to get to you

No one ever told me leaving was the easy part
I gotta stay away
Leaving you was easy, now I gotta do what's hard
I gotta stay away

Stay away, stay, stay away
Stay away, stay, stay away

If I go driving, then I'll put on music
If I put on music, then I'll play your song
If I play your song, then I think I'll lose it
End up pulled up at the front of your lawn
So I don't go driving, no, I just stay in
I don't do most things I used to do
'Cause every moment is a fork in the road
And all my roads lead back to you (You, you, you)

No one ever told me leaving was the easy part
I gotta stay away
Leaving you was easy, now I gotta do what's hard
I gotta stay away

Stay away, stay, stay away
Stay away, stay, stay away

If I turn off the light, then I might start thinking
If I start thinking, I'll think of the time when
You said that you love me, you said I was perfect
You said you were sorry, you said you were selfish
If I don't stop it, before I know it
All the bad things never happened
You never lied or treated me bad and
If you did, then you'll wish you hadn't
Start believing you were right and
I was being too dramatic
So I gotta leave the light on for tonight
Just so I can stay away

No one ever told me leaving was the easy part
I gotta stay away
Leaving you was easy, now I gotta do what's hard
I gotta stay away
Any little misstep, I'll be at your doorstep
Talking 'bout forgiveness, giving you my heart back
Just so you can break it one more time before I say
I gotta stay away

Stay away, stay, stay away
Stay away, stay, stay away
Stay away, stay away
Stay away, stay, stay away

"Who"

I never thought you knew what love was
Until I heard you sing a love song
With the way that you treat me
I had to reach my own conclusions

Oh I, I thought your heart was stone
I thought you never let your feelings show

So who, who, who are you singing about now?
Now

You sounded clear as a crystal
You sounded soft as the rainfall
And every note was a lump in my throat
But I knew I had to hear it all

I need to know who
Who, who are you singing about?
Who, who, who are you singing about now?
Now

And it was like a dream to hear such a sweet melody
But I knew it was not for me

I need to know who
Who, who are you singing about?
Who, who, who are you singing about now?
Who, who, who are you singing about now?
Who, who are you singing about now?
Who, who are you singing about?

"Navy Blue"

Drove to mountains in the morning
On the way back down, I thought my brakes were broken
And the road would end but I would just keep going
Through the air and into the Pacific Ocean

I'm just trying to keep my head above
Water
Get enough sleep and drink enough
Water

I'm so navy blue
I'm so navy blue
I'm so navy blue over you

Took a train to a friend's house feeling shaken
Seems like you somehow turn up when I'm at my weakest
Don't know what to say so leave it blank like silence
Go back home and wait for some new change that's coming

I'm just trying to keep my head above
Water
Get enough sleep and drink enough
Water

I'm so navy blue
I'm so navy blue
I'm so navy blue over you
I'm so navy blue
I'm so navy blue
I'm so navy blue over you

Do you know that I've been holding my breath all of this time?
Weren't you gonna call me when you got back?
Was it all lies?
Do you know that I've been holding my breath all of this time?
Weren't you gonna love me if I just did everything right?
Do you know that I've been holding my breath all of this time?
Weren't you gonna call me when you got back?
Was it all lies?
Do you know that I've been holding my breath all of this time?
Weren't you gonna love me if I just did everything right?

I'm so blue
I'm so

"Never"

I don't know if I like love
I think I've had enough
Seems like it's alright for some
It's just I am not one
Consider this my resignation
Please consider this an end
And deliver this recitation
To the one who did me in

I'll never love again
I'll never love again
I'll never love again
I'll never love again

I don't know if I like songs
I think maybe I was wrong
To think I could make it hurt less
With a chorus sing-along
Consider this, cause this is it
As a kind of requiem
And deliver this last performance
To the source from which it stems

I'll never sing again
I'll never sing again
I'll never sing again
I'll never sing again

"Pink Light"

(Are you happy?)

So I let it happen again
I loved someone who's indifferent
That's why I can't sleep at night
That's why I keep sleeping in

So I started over again
I got back onto that medicine
That's why I keep sleeping in
I don't like when dreaming ends

But there's a pink light in my apartment
It comes mid-morning as a reminder
That at the right time, in the right surroundings
I will be lovely, but I can't help thinking

That maybe if you stayed for an hour or two
When the sun came up, when I last saw you
Maybe if you'd seen the soft pink light
I wouldn't be alone tonight

So I'm living inside my mind
I keep retracing that storyline
Thinking, if I start again
I can change the way it ends

And there's a pink light in my apartment
It comes mid-morning as a reminder
That at the right time, in the right surroundings
I will be lovely, but I can't help thinking

That maybe if you stayed for an hour or two
When the sun came up, when I last saw you
Maybe if you'd seen the soft pink light
I wouldn't be alone tonight
Tonight, tonight
Alone tonight

Maybe I will always keep
A little piece of this belief
If it isn't you who sees
Then there isn't any pink light in my apartment
It comes mid-morning as a reminder

And maybe if you stayed for an hour or two
When the sun came up, when I last saw you
Maybe if you'd seen the soft pink light
I wouldn't be alone tonight
Tonight, tonight
Alone tonight
Tonight, tonight

"Taken"

Pulled up, quarter to 11
Waited a minute 'til you went in
We talked and then we stopped talking
Put on a song and we listened
I know that I make you nervous
I do it half on purpose
You know I think you're precious
Yeah, I think you're a good person

So why do I wanna blow up your life?

I'll be a very good girl
I won't even think about it
I'm just feeling like I can't help it
I know you said you had a girlfriend
I just want it if it's taken
If it's taken

Dad left when I was 11
Mom said it was 'cause he couldn't
Keep from touching other women
Some things have a way of sticking
And now I'm standing in your kitchen
You said you told her you were leaving
And I can't help thinking
I hate you 'cause you're just like him

So why did I have to blow up your life?

I'll be a very good girl
I won't even think about it
I'm just feeling like I can't help it
I know you said you had a girlfriend
I just want it

I just thought that if I could take you from her
Maybe then it would prove that I'm worth something
Now I'm alone and I'm hurt
Wishing I'd taken you at your word
When you said that you were taken

I'll be a very good girl
I won't even think about it
I'm just feeling like I can't help it
I know you said you had a girlfriend
I just want it if it's taken

I know you said
I just want it

"Hands Off"

I see you, I see you
And it's been some time since I've seen you last
You know the night, I bet you know the night
I'm here, you're here
And it's in the air like a firefly
June and July, like it's June and July

I, I, I know you're bad for me
But when you say you want me again
Want me again and again
I can feel you up on me
It hits me all of the sudden
(Wait, why would I do that?)

No, you can't touch, get your hands off of me
(Can't touch, hands off)
There's no reason, just a feeling, I'm free
(Can't touch, your hands off)
No, you can't touch, get your hands off of me
(Can't touch, hands off)
There's no reason, just a feeling, I'm free
(Can't touch, hands off)

I see you, I see you
And, oh God, I get so high every time
Happens every time
A damn idea
I focus then I hold that feeling inside
Got this feeling inside

I, I, I want you, come closer
I feel like I've been here before
Been here before, before
You, you, you want the power
You tell me it's now or never
(What the heck?)

No, you can't touch, get your hands off of me
(Can't touch, hands off)
There's no reason, just a feeling, I'm free
(Can't touch, hands off)
No, you can't touch, get your hands off of me
(Can't touch, hands off)
There's no reason, just a feeling, I'm free
(Can't touch, hands off) I'm free

You think I'm playing hard to get
This must be hard to get
You've got to get your hands off, yeah
You think I'm playing with your head
This must be hard to get
(Do you need me to do the chorus again, or...?)

Can't touch, get your hands off of me
There's no reason, just a feeling, I'm free
No, you can't touch, get your hands off of me
There's no reason, just a feeling, I'm free
I'm free

Can't touch, hands off
No, you can't touch, get your, get your hands off

"Good News (Ya-Ya Song)"

I must be some great feeler
I must be really deep
I had a minor major crisis
When you stopped calling me

I saw a psychic healer
She just turned seventeen
All that she said was to do what I want
Like I'm supposed to know what that means

I'm gonna figure it out
'Cause I'm already here, and I won't leave now
So put a pot of coffee on
I'm just having a time
But the good news is, if you don't like life
They say it doesn't last so long

Ooh, ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya

I was sad in the kitchen
Tearing myself apart
Trying to search for the piece that I'm missing
But I didn't know where to start

So I went to an art exhibit
There wasn't any art
All that there was was a sink and some dishes
And a sign saying, "Be where you are"

I'm gonna figure it out
'Cause I'm already here, and I won't leave now
So put a pot of coffee on
I'm just having a time
But the good news is, if you don't like life
They say it doesn't last so long

Ooh, ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya

I know it's not just me
Who thinks it is just me
I know it's not just me
Who thinks it is

Ooh, ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya
Ya-ya ya-ya, ya-ya ya-ya

"Memento"

Got a bee sting on the way back from your house
It was crawling up my leg inside my car
Something 'bout the way I had to pull it out
Never healed quite right, and now I've got a scar

I'm glad it left a mark
I'm glad it left a mark

To remind me what it seems like I forget
When I'm drinking or I'm thinking with my heart
Softly saying, "Baby, this is what you get
When you're reckless, and you're playing in the dark"

I'm glad it left a mark
I'm glad it left a mark
I'm glad it left a mark

"It's Gonna Be Okay, Baby"

You're gonna move to New York
And experiment with communism
Go down on a girl
After reading her some Frantz Fanon
And you'll go out of your way
Trying to find some place you can hide and get high
You're gonna think about suicide
Yeah, you're gonna call your mom

It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay

You're gonna cut off your hair
With dull scissors from the desk in your dorm room
Learn by trial and error
That threesomes are more sad than fun
You're gonna move to LA
Guess you're running away from the patterns you have
And the decisions that you've made
Yeah, you're gonna sit in the sun

It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay

You're gonna smoke cigarettes
On the ground beside the pool at Stardust
You're gonna get obsessed
With a boy who's hooked on heroin
You'll have some all-time nights
Dancing outside with LCD on the speaker
And you're drinking dark pink wine
Yeah, and you're gonna lose those friends

It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay

You're gonna fall in love
With a girl, which you were not expecting
You're gonna start a band
It's just her, another friend, and you
And then you get freaked out
You say something about how you just can't commit
And you move into your aunt's house
Yeah, and all your dreams come true

It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay

You're gonna come to depend
On the sex of a sadistic stranger
You're gonna learn to pretend
Yeah, you lie about it to save face
Until the morning you awake
In the deepest of pain that you've even been in
And you admit you've gotta quit him
Yeah, you're gonna learn to pray

It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay (It's gonna be okay)
It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay (It's gonna be okay)

You're gonna start to call friends
You're gonna start to call yourself an addict
You finally read "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"
You're gonna clean out your drawers
You're gonna feel much more like God is a mystery
And Jesus is a metaphor
Yeah, you're gonna tell your reflection

It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay (It's gonna be okay)
It's gonna be okay, baby
It's gonna be okay (It's gonna be okay)

It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay

"Silk Chiffon"
(feat. Phoebe Bridgers)

Sun down and I'm feeling lifted
Downtown, cherry lipstick
Watch her silk dress dancing in the wind
Watch it brush against her skin
Makes me wanna try her on

Like, life's so fun, life's so fun
Got my mini skirt and my rollerblades on
Bag on my side 'cause I'm up 'til dawn
Keeping it light like silk chiffon
Life's so fun, life's so fun
Don't need to worry about no one
She said I got her if I want
She's so soft like silk chiffon

Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me
Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me
(Oh, when she's on)

I'm high and I'm feeling anxious
Inside of the CVS
When she turns 'round halfway down the aisle
With that 'you're on camera' smile
Like she wants to try me on

And life's so fun, life's so fun
Got my mini skirt and my rollerblades on
Bag on my side 'cause I'm up 'til dawn
Keeping it light like silk chiffon
Life's so fun, life's so fun
Don't need to worry about no one
She said that I got her if I want
She's so soft like silk chiffon

Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me
Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me

It feels good to me, it feels good to me
Oo, why wouldn't it be? Oo, why wouldn't it be?
It feels good to me, it feels good to me
Oo, why wouldn't it be? Oo, why wouldn't it be?
She's so soft like silk chiffon

Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me
Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me

Oh, when she's on me

"What I Want"

When I go out again
I'm gonna drink a lot
I'm gonna take a shot
'Cause that's just what I want, want, want
What I want, want, want, mmm

And when I see my friend
Put something on her tongue
I'm gonna ask for one
'Cause that's just what I want, want, want
What I want, want, I want

I've spent way too, too, too many years
Not knowing what
What I wanted, how to get it, how to live it and now
I'm gonna make up for it all at once
'Cause that's, that's just what I want

I want the full effects
I wanna hit it hard
I wanna dance in the middle of a gay bar
Ooh, that's what I want
There's nothing wrong
With what I want
Yeah, yeah

I want the fireworks
I want the chemistry
I want that girl right over there to wanna date me
Ooh, that's what I want
There's nothing wrong
With what I want
Yeah, yeah

She's dancing to the song
With all her leather on
I think we'll get along
'Cause she's got what I want, want, want
What I want, want, I want

I've spent way too, too, too many years
Not knowing what
What I wanted, how to get it, how to live it and now
I'm gonna make up for it all at once
'Cause that's, that's just what I want

I want the full effects
I wanna hit it hard
I wanna dance in the middle of a gay bar
Ooh, that's what I want
There's nothing wrong
With what I want
Yeah, yeah

I want the fireworks
I want the chemistry
I want that girl right over there to wanna date me
Ooh, that's what I want
There's nothing wrong
With what I want
Yeah, yeah

My hands are shaking, it's psychosomatic
That's how bad I want what I want
What I want, what I want
I'm gonna take it, I'm just gonna grab it
That's how bad I want what I want
What I want, what I want

I've spent too, too, too many years
I've cried too, too, too many tears
And now I'm gonna make up for it all at once
'Cause that's, that's just what I want

I want the full effects
I wanna hit it hard
I wanna dance in the middle of a gay bar
Ooh, that's what I want
There's nothing wrong
With what I want
Yeah, yeah

I want the fireworks
I want the chemistry
I want that girl right over there to wanna date me
Ooh, that's what I want
There's nothing wrong
With what I want
Yeah, yeah

"Runner's High"

Since I left
I've not been drinking or staying out late
I get up early and I meditate
Paint the walls a different color

I've been doing
Almost everything I wanted to
Shame I couldn't do it with you
Maybe it's just human nature and I

Didn't fake those tears
But I haven't felt like crying
Since I put the car in gear
I've been

Feeling alright
Moving fast so you can't cross my mind
Sometimes I wonder if I'm
On a runner's high

Didn't stay for the fight
Honey, you should see me fly
Since I ran out on you, I'm
On a runner's high

(On a runner's high)

If I regress
And picture you laying with her
You'd think that I'd find it disturbing
But it doesn't really hurt me
I've been

Feeling alright
Moving fast so you can't cross my mind
Sometimes I wonder if I'm
On a runner's high

Didn't stay for the fight
Honey, you should see me fly
Since I ran out on you, I'm
On a runner's high

Hit me so I know I can feel something
You said I'd regret when I was leaving
Funny how a fall can feel just like flying
When I'm waiting for it to

Hit me
(Hit me so I know I can feel something)
But I'm feeling alright
(You said I'd regret when I was leaving
Funny how a fall can feel just like flying)
Am I on a runner's high?

"Home By Now"

Heard that you were selling your piano and your car
It feels so weird to not reach out and ask you how you are
I wonder if you're moving or if money's just that tight
These are the kinds of questions to which I've resigned my rights

Ever since
I decided
There were things
That I needed
That you couldn't give to me
But I'm still wondering

Would we have turned a corner if I had waited?
Do I need to lower my expectations?
If we'd kept heading the same direction
Would we be home by
Now I don't know if I'd been okay with
Holding out hope for your stack of rainchecks
If I had been able to grin and bear it
Would we be home by now

Have you ever heard about how when a person's in a maze
They will tend to walk in circles thinking they are going straight
They can't see the bigger picture so they get stuck in a loop
In the end I was afraid that that's what you and I would do

But I still
Have my moments
Where every reason
Feels a lot like an excuse
I wanna ask you

Would we have turned a corner if I had waited?
Do I need to lower my expectations?
If we'd kept heading the same direction
Would we be home by
Now I don't know if I'd been okay with
Holding out hope for your stack of rainchecks
If I had been able to grin and bear it
Would we be home by now

What is love supposed to feel like anyway?
Why is it so hot in LA
In late October?
Said I don't know if it's enough to make it last
You said if I even had to ask
You had your answer
But I still wonder

Would we have turned a corner if I had waited?
Do I need to lower my expectations?
If we'd kept heading the same direction
Would we be home by
Now I don't know if I'd been okay with
Holding out hope for your stack of rainchecks
If I had been able to grin and bear it
Would we be home by now

"Kind Of Girl"

I'm the kind of girl
Who takes things a little too far
Presses a little too hard
That's why you left a mark and

I'm the kind of girl
Who wants everything she can't get
Leaving alone and yet
Somehow still leaving a mess but

I'm a girl who's learning
Everything I say isn't
Definitive
I'm not some kind of minor trope
Who's never gonna change that's so
Derivative

I could get up tomorrow
Talk to myself real gentle
Work in the garden
Go out and meet somebody
Who actually likes me for me
And this time I'll let them
Yeah, I like telling stories
But I don't have to write them in ink
I could still change the end
At least I'm the kind of girl
I'm the kind of girl who thinks I can
The kind of girl who thinks I can

I'm the kind of girl
Who's likely to drive you insane
Restless forever untamed
A little in love with the pain but

I'm the kind of girl
Who owns up to all of my faults
Who's learning to laugh at 'em all
Like I'm not a problem to solve

I'm a girl who's blowing on a dandelion
Thinkin' how the winds could change at
Any given time

I could get up tomorrow
Talk to myself real gentle
Work in the garden
Go out and meet somebody
Who actually likes me for me
And this time I'll let them
Yeah, I like telling stories
But I don't have to write them in ink
I could still change the end
At least I'm the kind of girl
I'm the kind of girl who thinks I can
The kind of girl who thinks I can

"Handle Me"

Who taught you that
If you get a good thing
You better not touch it too much?
Who taught you that
You got to keep your hands clean
Or you're gonna mess it all up?

I am not a brand-new bicycle
I am rough around the edge
I am not a flower petal

You can handle me
You can handle me
Put your hands on me
Well, you can handle me

What got you thinkin'
If you love someone
It's best to just leave 'em alone?
Look how you got me
You've got me reelin'
Waiting for you to come over

And put me to a higher purpose
Bend me back and send me flyin'
I'm not gonna break, I promise

You can handle me
You can handle me
Put your hands on me
You can handle me

Kiss me under my right ear
Running your fingers down the back of my spine
Handle me
Grab a fistful of my hair
Trace me like an outline
Handle me
Flip me onto my left side
So we can intertwine and
Handle me
Hold me like you're the tie that binds
Spread this out across time and
Handle me

"No Idea"

I think you think I'm like a virgin
Not in a biblical sense
You think I'm nervous and uncertain
Because I'm waiting

You seem like such a good thing, a good thing
I know that good things take time
I keep it so clean, so clean
But baby in the back of my mind

You have no idea, you have no idea
The things I think about you when you aren't here
You have no idea, you have no idea
But when you find out it's all you're gonna hear

Ringing in your ears
Ooh
I'll be ringing in your ears
Ooh

There is a ring around my finger
Left when I pulled it from my lips
You see me unfolding a napkin
You see me give it a kiss

And you have no idea, you have no idea
The things I think about you when you aren't here
You have no idea, you have no idea
But when you find out it's all you're gonna hear

Ringing in your ears
Ooh
I'll be ringing in your ears
Ooh

You think I'm such a good thing, a good thing
You have no idea
You think I'm such a good thing, a good thing

You have no idea
The things I think about you
When you find out it's all you're gonna hear
So tell me when you want to
Come and find out
Leave me ringing in yourâ

You're gonna say that I'm on a high horse
I think that my horse is regular-sized
Did you ever think maybe
You're on a pony
Going in circles on a carousel ride?
You're gonna say I asked for the moon
I think that it's you with your head in the sky
All that I wanted was somebody honest
Living for more than their next good time

You say that you wanna change
Well, I hope you get everything you want
Everything you want
You say that you need relief
Well, I hope you get everything you need
Everything but me
'Cause I don't wanna stick around trying to work it out
When everything feels wrong
Everything feels wrong
But it's all love and it's no regrets
You can call me if there's anything you need
Anything, anything but

Me, me yeah
Me, me yeah
Me, me yeah
Anything you need
Anything but me

Go ahead and hate me as long as you need to
Go ahead and break me a piece of your mind
Say I always had one foot out
Well, baby, I got two now
Good thing I've never been afraid of goodbye

You say that you wanna change
Well, I hope you get everything you want
Everything you want
You say that you need relief
Well, I hope you get everything you need
Everything but me
'Cause I don't wanna stick around trying to work it out
When everything feels wrong
Everything feels wrong
But it's all love and it's no regrets
You can call me if there's anything you need
Anything, anything but

Me, me yeah
Me, me yeah
Me, me yeah
Anything you need
Anything but me

And sure, it's not all so black and white
Sure, I'm gonna cry
For the love we couldn't keep
But I would rather lose you
Than who I'm meant to be
So you can have anything but

Me, me yeah
Me, me yeah
Me, me yeah
Anything you need
Anything but
Me, me yeah
Me, me yeah
Me, me yeah
Anything you need
Anything but me

"Loose Garment"

I knew before it started
This August would be a hard one
Late summer love sprung up between us
Didn't last through the seasons

I'm broken hearted, I'm disappointed
It was still beautiful
Took myself out to dinner and
Cried about you on the way home

Used to wear my sadness like a choker
Yeah, it had me by the throat
Tonight I feel I'm draped in it
Like a loose garment
I just let it flow

I could come up with reasons I didn't love you well enough
Shooting a second arrow into the hole where the first was

We've paid in pain
Now we'll keep the change
The blame is for the birds (The blame is for the birds)
I'll break it up in pieces and feed it to them by the river

Used to wear my sadness like a choker
Yeah, it had me by the throat
Tonight I feel I'm draped in it
Like a loose garment
I just let it flow

"Shooting Star"

I heard there's a few different people you're talking to
I wonder if you lose track of them some of the time
I'm laughing 'cause I know I only just met you
But you're already spanning skylines inside of my mind

And tonight when I closed that door
I wanted to turn back
But when I see a shooting star
I stay out of its path

And that's what you are
You're so bright
You'd burn my eyes
And you'd move too fast
So I say goodnight
Make it home
Like I'm making a wish
On you, from afar
You, my shooting star

I know what you wanted because I wanted it too
To be in your light, consumed and erased
But your light doesn't stay, you'd take it away too soon
You'd leave me hung over the moon, stranded in space

So even though tonight when I closed that door
I wanted to turn back
I know when I see a shooting star
To stay out of its path

And that's what you are
You're so bright
You'd burn my eyes
And you'd move too fast
So I say goodnight
Make it home
Like I'm making a wish
On you, from afar
You, my shooting

Starlight, star bright
The only star I see tonight
I wish I may
And I think I might regret this either way
If I let you in my heart
Or keep you in the dark
So I love you from afar
You, my shooting star

"2BMoved"

Yes or no
Make the choice
That's the way it's always been
In my head
All the noise
Clouding my judgement
Then you crossed into my line of vision and suddenly
I don't even have to think or know

I move to touch ya
I move to hold ya, in my hands
I move to move ya
I move to make your river bend
As I move towards ya
I lose all fear of giving in
You're my compulsion
Your water turns me into sand

In a wave of emotion

And if I tried to turn away
Too ashamed of my feelings
In my dreams
You would stay
Deep inside the current
This is bigger than my being
Bigger than morality
When you're standing next to me

I'm just moved to touch ya
I'm moved to hold ya, in my hands
I'm moved to move ya
I'm moved to make your river bend
As I move towards ya
I lose all fear of giving in
You're my compulsion
Your water turns me into sand

In a wave of emotion

You're my way to be moved
I've been waiting to be moved
You're my way to be moved

I've been waiting to be moved to touch ya
I move to hold ya, in my hands
I move to move ya
I move to make your river bend
As I move towards ya
I lose all fear of giving in
You're my compulsion
Your water turns me into sand
In a wave of emotion

"Bad At Letting Go"

That precious piece of time where
Nobody even knows yet
Guess you call that a secret
And I wanna keep it as long as I can
I don't wanna change no plans

I'm surfing on the surface
Cause deeper makes me nervous
Internalize on purpose
I'll deal with it when I get in my bed
I don't wanna go there yet

My night just took a detour
Slide in through the back door

Dancing in the bar
The boys have all turned to shapes
Cursing in the dark
And no one heard anything

It's like lighting a match that you don't ever throw
I'm good at getting attached
And bad at letting go

Someone hold my heart
Cause right now it's killing me
Drinks are hitting hard
But I can feel everything

It's like lighting a match that you don't ever throw
I'm good at getting attached
And bad at letting go

And bad at letting go

I'm finding it convenient
That if I keep on moving
Nobody's gonna see them
The tears that are slipping right off of my skin
T don't want 'em to sink in

My night just took a detour
Slide in through the back door

Dancing in the bar
The boys have all turned to shapes
Cursing in the dark
And no one heard anything

It's like lighting a match that you don't ever throw
I'm good at getting attached
And bad at letting go

Someone hold my heart
Cause right now it's killing me
Drinks are hitting hard
But I can feel everything

It's like lighting a match that you don't ever throw
I'm good at getting attached
And bad at letting go

"Feel Better"

Well I know that you heard what I said
Why don't you tell me where you'll be tonight?
I wanna show you what's inside my head
You won't have to tell me what you like
I think I got a way of knowin' what you like
I listen with my fingers

Oh, oh
You don't need to make a sound
I know how it feels
I know just how it feels
Oh, oh
You don't need to make a sound
I know how it feels
And I'll always wanna make it feel
Better
Better
Better
Better

Well you know I hear what they say
I shouldn't have to tell you it ain't right
But when the bullshit's got you losing it
And you're just too tired to try
I will let you cry
Right here, inside my arms

Oh, oh
You don't need to make a sound
I know how it feels
I know just how it feels
Oh, oh
You don't need to make a sound
I know how it feels
And I'll always wanna make it feel
Better

Oh, yeah
Come on, come on, girl

Oh, yeah
Come on, come on, girl

Oh, yeah
Come on, come on, girl

Oh, yeah
Come on, come on, girl

Oh, yeah
Come on, come on, girl

Oh, oh
You don't need to make a sound
I know how it feels
I know just how it feels
Oh, oh
You don't need to make a sound
I know how it feels
And I'll always wanna make it feel
Better

Oh, oh
You don't need to make a sound
I know how it feels
I know just how it feels
Oh, oh
You don't need to make a sound
I know how it feels
And I'll always wanna make it feel
Better
Better
Better
Better

"Honey"

And even if I am not alone
I know I'll hold heart close
I know I'll hold heart close

In the shade, in the shade
In the sun, in the sun, oh-ooh
It's the same, it's the same
Honey, sweet honey
Sweet
Sweet
Sweet
Sweet

I couldn't care for you I said and I turned away
"You love that honeydew, do you?"
"I do," I dare say
That even with all eyes on our hands
I know I'll gladly stand
I know I'll gladly stand

In the shade, in the shade
In the sun, in the sun, oh-ooh
It's the same, it's the same
Honey, sweet honey
Sweet
Sweet
Sweet
Sweet

In the shade in the shade, ooh-ooh
In the sun in the sun, ooh-whoa
I'm amazed, you're made of honey
Sweet honey
Sweet
Sweet
Sweet
Sweet

"I Know A Place (MNEK Remix)"

[Katie Gavin:]
I knew
When you told me you don't wanna go home tonight
And you tried to just shrug it off when I asked you why
Somebody hurt you
Somebody hurt you
But you're here by my side
And I knew
'Cause I can recall when I was the one in your seat
I still got the scars and they occasionally bleed
Cause somebody hurt me
Somebody hurt me
But I'm staying alive

And I can tell
When you get nervous
You think being yourself
Means being unworthy
And it's hard to love
With a heart that's hurting
But if you want to go out dancing

I know a place (ooh)
I know a place we can go (yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Just give me trust and watch what'll happen
'Cause I know (ooh)
I know a place we can run (yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Don't you be afraid of love and affection
Just lay down your weapon

[MNEK:]
Right now
It's like you're carrying all the weight of your past
I see all your bruises, yellow, dark blue, and black
But baby a bruise is, only your body
Tryna keep you intact
[Katie Gavin:]
So right now
I think we should go get drunk on cheap wine
I think we should hop on the purple line
'Cause maybe our purpose
Is to never give up when we're on the right track

[Katie Gavin & MNEK:]
And I can tell
When you get nervous
You think being yourself
Means being unworthy
And it's hard to love
With a heart that's hurting
But if you want to go out dancing

I know a place (ooh)
I know a place we can go (we can go)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Just give me trust and watch what'll happen
'Cause I know (ooh)
I know a place we can run (we can run, yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
Don't you be afraid of love and affection
Just lay down your weapon

[Katie Gavin:]
Lay down your weapon
Lay down your weapon
I, I know a place we can go
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon
[MNEK:] Just give me trust, give me trust, give me trust

[Katie Grand & MNEK:]
'Cause I know (ooh)
I know a place we can go (we can go, yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon
Lay down their weapon (yeah)
Just give me trust and watch what'll happen
'Cause I know (I know)
I know a place we can stay (yeah)
Where everyone gonna lay down their weapon (lay down)
Lay down their weapon (lay down)
Don't you be afraid of love and affection
Just lay down your weapon

"In My Way"

Red, red rover, why don't you come on over?
Why the hell has it been so long, oh?
Wait, never mind that
I know that that's my bad
For a while, I thought I should leave you alone

Cause I didn't like the way that you make me cry
But the way you make me come makes it all alright

I'm not afraid to say-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay
I love you in my way-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay
I'm not afraid to say-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay
I love you in my way-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay

You call me a weirdo
You're happy to be here, though
I keep beating on your body, baby
When we get to it
Ooh the way we do it
Got me feeling like it's all gonna be okay

When it unfurls
It's a sick, sad world
But I'm your girl
Even when I'm not your girl

I'm not afraid to say-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay
I love you in my way-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay
I'm not afraid to say-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay
I love you in my way-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay

Even if, if it doesn't all go my way
Even if, if it doesn't all go my way
Even if, if it doesn't all go my way
Even if, if it doesn't all go my way

I'm not afraid to say-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay
I love you in my way-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay
I'm not afraid to say-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay
I love you in my way-ay, ay-ay, ay-ay

"Maximum"

Ego, ego
Now I have done it again
I've forgotten what it is to be human
I am energy
I am nothing greater than
What I give and what I take from another one

You are the moon, I am the moon
You are the sun, I am the sun
You got me riding on your flow
We're on our way
To the maximum

Syne-Synergy
You have shown me much of it
You reflect it in my heart like a diamond
There is beauty moving underneath our skin
When we open up our minds in unison

You are the moon, I am the moon
You are the sun, I am the sun
You got me riding on your flow
We're on our way
To the maximum

You are the moon, I am the moon
You are the sun, I am the sun
You got me riding on your flow
We're on our way
To the maximum

And if you push, then I will pull
And if you go, I will follow
And if you pull, then I will push
And if you go, I will follow

You
Are the moon, I am the moon
You are the sun, I am the sun
You got me riding on your flow
We're on our way
To the maximum

You
Are the moon, I am the moon
You are the sun, I am the sun
You got me riding on your flow
We're on our way
To the maximum

"Nihilist"
(from "Promising Young Woman" soundtrack)

If anyone is making this, count me with a nihilist tonight
Out on 23rd and Fig, half naked, and drunk, and high

And when I come through swinging, you can hear me singing

Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters
Because if it did, I couldn't handle it

And anyone can have a go
If you wanna touch me, let me know
And when I'm at my lowest low, that's when I'm most comfortable

And when I come through swinging, you can hear me singing
And on the pavement later, you can hear me whisper

Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters
Because if it did, I couldn't handle it

So kill me with a nihilist, tonight, I guess
You can kill me with the nihilist tonight
So kill me the nihilist, tonight, I guess
You can kill me with the nihilist

Pour me one more or whatever
Pour me one more or whatever
Nothing really matters, really matters
Pour me one more or whatever
Pour me one more or whatever
Nothing really matters, really matters

So kill me with the nihilist, tonight, I guess
You can kill me with the nihilist tonight
Kill me with the nihilist, tonight, I guess
You can kill me with the nihilist tonight

"One That Got Away"

I'm the one
Who opened up, ready for a connection
I'm the one
Brave enough to say how I was feeling
I'm the one waiting by the phone
The one who is home alone
'Til I realized you were only messing around
Yeah, you played it like a game
Never called it by its name
Isn't it a shame how

Now I'm the one that got away
The kiss you never tasted
Tell me that you hate it
Hate that I'm no longer in your reach
If I can't hear you say it
Maybe you can't change it, but if you never
If you never put it on the line
How am I gonna sign for it?
Yeah, you never
You never let me know I'm what you want
Maybe that's why I'm the one
The one that got away
The kiss you never tasted
Now I'm the one that got away
Tell me that you hate it

I'm the one
Who's crying over you in a bath on the weekend
But I'm the one
Who isn't scared to dive into love on the deep end
You're the one lying to your friends
You're the one who can't pretend
That there are no consequences to what you do
But the truth is that it's costly
Baby, 'cause you lost me
Soon enough you're gonna see

That I'm the one that got away
The kiss you never tasted
Tell me that you hate it
Hate that I'm no longer in your reach
If I can't hear you say it
Maybe you can't change it, but if you never (If you never, if you never)
If you never put it on the line
How am I gonna sign for it?
Yeah, you never
You never let me know I'm what you want
Maybe that's why

The one that got away
The kiss you never tasted
Tell me that you hate it
Hate that I'm no longer in your reach (Your reach)
If I can't hear you say it
Maybe you can't change it, but if you never

If you never put it on the line
How am I gonna sign for it?
Yeah, you never
You never let me know I'm what you want
Maybe that's why I'm
The one that got away
The kiss you never tasted
Now I'm the one that got away
Tell me that you hate it

"The Grave"

There is a spiral
In the way back
Of your mind
Waiting for attention
There is a pathway
Way down to
The dark
Built for destruction

But if you can
Push past
Everything you buried in the ashes
Feel it
Breathing

All along the life was there
(All along, ah)
Fruit so sweet you're scared to bear it
(Fruit so sweet you're, ah)

All long the life was there
Fruit so sweet you're scared to
Bear it
Yeah-yeah

There is a cherry tree
With no leaves
On the grave you dug your dreams
Somebody told you, save the sun for
More blessed, more perfect beings

But if you rise on your knees
Mourn the love you did not receive
Open knotted limbs and begin to
Breathe the light that you could not see
You'll
Feel it
Growing

All along the life was there
(All along, ah)
Fruit so sweet you're scared to bear it
(Fruit so sweet you're, ah)

All long the life was there
Fruit so sweet you're
Scared to
Bear it
Yeah-yeah

Sweet dreams
You deserve

Sweet dreams
You deserve

Sweet dreams
You deserve

Sweet dreams
You deserve

"Winterbreak (TiÃ«sto's Deep House Remix)"
(with TiÃ«sto)

You say
I say
Last time
This time
You say I'd best be going cause it's getting late
And I say
Why don't I walk you home cause it's on the way
But the last time
That we made love, you left in tears
So this time
You're wondering how to leave it here
And I haven't seen you since last winter break
And I know that I broke your heart
But always such a smart one, always so intelligent
You must know that I took it hard

Oh, baby I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try
You say
I say
Last time
This time

You pull
That face like, 'here we go again'
So I pull
A flask out the back of my jeans
And then you take a pull
And in my mind we're in my bed
And I'm pulling
Your sweater up over your head
And I haven't seen you since last winter break
And I know that you hate how that went
But always such a smart one, always so intelligent
You must know what's happening

Oh it's magnetic, isn't it?
The sense of something underneath the surface
When you're laying on thin ice
Just a little bit masochistic
A tentative ellipses
The parting of your lips and the ache in your eyes
But I think I'm gonna kiss you

Oh, baby, I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try

Oh, baby, I think we both know
This is the love that we won't get right
Still if you said that you wanted
I know I'll always have one more try

You say
I say
Last time
This time
