"buggin"

I get hung up
Biting my tongue
And sucking my thumb
And waiting for those who don't want me

But you're bugging if you think I'm in love with you
I know that I told you
But I just need anything to give love to
You're bugging if you think I'm in love with you
I know that I told you
But I just need anything to give love to

There's a Beetle in the pool and I'm reaching out for you
And you're clinging to my fingerprints
Flashing purple blue
Cause there's a Beetle in the pool and I'm reaching out for
And you're clinging to my fingerprints
Flashing purple blue

I get hung up
Biting my tongue
And sucking my thumb
And waiting for those who don't want me
And you pile up
And I hope to go numb
But I scavenge the crumbs
And follow the trails that you leave me

I was bugging when I said I'm in love with you
I know that I told you
But I just need anything to give love to
I was bugging when I said I'm in love with you
I know that I told you
But I'd give love to anything that hurts like you

"talk abt"

I wake up on a Friday and I know that he's gone

I just need somewhere warm I can curl up
Just to rest my head
I just need someone that I can screw up
Like his cigarettes
He called me prophetic but I'm a fuck up
Call me that instead
I'm posting this bullshit so he'll know I'm up
But he's with his friends

He's all I talk about
He's all I talk about
Wish I could get him out of my mouth
But he's all I talk about

I sleep in on the weekend cause he's not in my dawn

I just need someone that I can shut out
Just to get ahead
I just need something that I can hear out
Just so it's misread
He called me electric but I'm a black out
Call me that instead
I'd cling like a leech if he'd put his arm out
Till I'm in his head

He's all I talk about
He's all I talk about
Wish I could get him out of my mouth
But he's all I talk about
He's all I talk about
He's all I talk about
Talk abt
He's all I talk about
He's all I talk about
Wish I could get him out of my mouth

"swallowing stones"

Swallowing stones
On the way to your home
I waste time being wistful and slow
Get so tired of singing your songs

Say I'll move to the city
When I'm finally grown
But I been driving the long way home
Round the block just to finish that song

Deciduous forest ain't growing my way
Say things'll get better when I get away
But I been watching the skyline and been getting home late
Counting ways that I love you and lights on the parkway

Where was I hiding when
We all grew up
Watching blinking lights changing
On the edge of some bluff
I keep making mistakes
And they're not makin' me any tougher
And I wish everyone liked me but
You'd be more than enough

Swallowing stones
On the way past your home
I like who your parents are voting for
There's a sign on your lawn

I'm gonna move to the city
When they tell me that I've grown
We could waste our lives being wistful and slow
Miss my prime while I'm choking on stones

"1/2"

Why do I feel like I'm half of a whole
With this head on my shoulders 10 fingers and toes
It's me that I live for but you I can't help but extol
Call me 1/2 but I think that I'm all that I have
Call me 1/2 but I think that I'm all that I have

Your people flow through just to give and to take
The crossing guards, lovers, and summer camp friends
And the teachers from the 7th grade
So all of these bad days are gonna grow worn with age
Till the hairpins and nickels that gleam on your floor
Are the only things that remain

Why do I feel like I'm half of a whole
With this head on my shoulders 10 fingers and toes
It's me that I live for but you I can't help but extol
Call me 1/2 but I think that I'm all that I have
Call me 1/2 but I think that I'm all that I have
Call me 1/2 but I think that I'm all that I have
Call me 1/2 but I think that I'm all that I have

"gold star"

When I watch a movie
I skip to where they kiss
And I said I'm improving
So you'd love me just like this

I'll wait up for you
I'll wake up for you
Talk to strangers in the elevator so
You think I'm friendly like you
Make my bed for you
For when you finally come through
Do I write these sad songs just to sing them to you?
Could you give me a gold star and see me through?

I found myself eating
Candy after the parade
It was smashed in the pavement
On the sidewalk in the shade

I'll wait up for you
I'll wake up for you
Talk to strangers in the elevator so
You think I'm charming like you
Make my bed for you
For when you finally come through
Do I write these sad songs just to sing them to you?
Could you give me a gold star and see me through

"silver second"

Mitten in the snow
Angels in a row
My turn to place them
On the piano
Sweating through our coats
Blushing on the nose
We didn't know it
There in that moment

That everyone's together in that moment of your life
Frozen in a snow globe, spin so slowly like you're stuck in time, ah-ah, ah
When everyone's together in that moment of your life
All the tiny changes, pile up until you're snowed inside

You know I get cold
Moved away from home
Ran from the winter
I'm still your sister
Getting on the plane
Showing signs of age
Creased where we've smiled
I'm still your child

And everyone's together for a moment just today
Hold yourself together for a bit, before it slips away, ah-ah, ah, ah
When everyone's together for a moment just today
Let each silver second settle on your tongue and melt away, ayy, ayy, ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Ring around the year
End up right back here

"man"

I don't remember a single real thing about you
Just all of the sickness that you were supposed to see me through
And you're lucky as shit
The things I omit
Coz you stole more of me than I'd care to admit
So I can't remember all of the fucked shit that you'd do

So fuck all your gold stars
The cherries in the backyard
No amount of sugar could sweeten such a bitter heart
And fuck your soft boy scam
The cowboy or the Tarzan
No amount of nail polish coulda paint you a good man
Man

It's late at night when the sprinklers turn on as I'm leaving
And I don't know why every time I'm with you I lose feeling
I was already sick
When you called me your fix
Then I pushed mine aside to make room for your shit
I've spent life holding other people's aches in safe keeping

So fuck all your gold stars
The cherries in the backyard
No amount of sugar could sweeten such a bitter heart
And fuck your soft boy scam
The cowboy or the tarzan
No amount of nail polish coulda paint you a good man
Man
Man
Man

Man
Man
Man
Man

"security question"

Met you last night at some party I wandered to
Are you my friend now? You follow me and I follow you
In the morning we pass quietly on the street
You won't ever get to know each face you see

Wish I could make a friend today
Wish I could know your first pet's name
You use in all of your passwords since you were a child
Wish I could ask "How was your day?"
I wish I knew the person's name
You think of under the covers when you slip into the night

Hold the door for the person behind me, it's the only time
To show some warmth 'fore they brush past and swiftly return to their life
Could we lock eyes on the subway? Fall in love today
Or hands in pockets, forget their face and look away

Wish I could make a friend today
Wish I could know your first pet's name
You use in all of your passwords since you were a child
Wish I could ask "How was your day?"
I wish I knew the person's name
You think of under the covers when you slip into the night

We come so close
To changing each other all of the time
We come so close

"itch"

I swim 6 seas
Leave one waiting
To look forward to
Saw your future
I'm fidgeting
In the waiting room

And although
I'm oversaturated know I'm earnest too
And I know I'm eager
But I can't fucking wait for the day that I finally get to kiss you
Finally get to kiss you

What if I never scratched another
Itch for the rest of my life
Would I die
Satisfied
Knowing it can always get better than this

And although
I'm oversaturated know I'm earnest too
And I know
I'm eager but I swear I'm always true
Let go
A fact on a bottle cap, proof of god in your soup
Belly of a baby
Pearls against the tooth
A charm of living daylight napping in your room

What if I never scratched another
Itch for the rest of my life
Would I die
Satisfied
Knowing it can always get better than this

What if I never scratched another
Itch for the rest of my life
Would I die
Satisfied
Knowing it can always get better than this

"touch tank"

Canceled a hot hipster threesome for you
'Cause I preach of freedom, but you're a fucking great excuse
Plus I'd rather get naked and swim in your blow-up pool
And dry our dolphin bodies off and question your tattoos

'Cause he's so pretty when he goes down on me
Gold-skinned eager baby, blue shirt out the laundry
He tells me he's gentle when he wants to be
So I think he wants to be gentle with me

It's such a short drive to get to the touch tank
To you, deep sea pearl, my soft manta ray (Manta ray)
Tender two fingers to touch the display
I used to dive deep 'til I got splashed in the face

He's so pretty when he goes down on me
Gold-skinned eager baby, blue shirt out the laundry
He tells me he's gentle when he wants to be
So I think he wants to be gentle with me

You took my breath away
So now I can't suck in my stomach around you anymore
We're too old to live with our parents
Do you wanna wake up to me every morning?
Every morning
Every morning
I'm swimming into you
I'll tumble to the ocean in a parachute
I am swimming into you
I'll tumble to the ocean

He's so pretty when he goes down on me
Gold-skinned eager baby, blue shirt out the laundry
He tells me he's gentle when he wants to be
So I think he wants to be gentle with me

"popcorn & juice"

I want to eat popcorn and juice on the last day of school
Watch a movie and sit in the dark
And stay up real late playing iPod touch games
Hope my parents don't peek on a lark

And fall asleep in the car after the water park
With the radio soft in your ears
August coppertone tan, crannies filled up with sand
And salt water still clogging your ears, ears

"get what u get"

I fantasize about being cut down to size
And telling you sweet goodbyes as I'm watching you cry

Then I'm walking through some door to a place to get well
Where I can be cared for in a white sterile cell

And I don't like to poeticize or double the gravity
'Cause what's broken inside can rattle about in me
The bad days remind and the good days forget
The burden is mine and you get what you get

"emblem"

Give me a sec to envelope in dark
Just wait for the lights in the sky to go low
I'll glow at the boardwalk, the sidewalk, the park
Tangling in mesh on my float down the road

A wet seed wild in the hot blind earth
You forget too often existence's worth
It's green in the fracture, fill in where it hurts
Shine and endure like you're gold in the dirt
Gold in the dirt
Gold in the dirt
Gold in the dirt
Gold in the dirt

The simplest joys are the ones most profound
A flyaway fractal, a dragonfly wing
Smooth stones from the beach and bolts found on the ground
Gems waiting for your eyes to see them gleaming

A wet seed wild in the hot blind earth
It's a holiday and you're ready to burst
We wrap up the lilacs in old newspaper
Everyone knows that you're gold in the dirt
Gold in the dirt
Gold in the dirt
Gold in the dirt
Gold in the dirt

The birds ate the pulp and they dropped down the seed
With intricate pattern down to the last cell
A stone from a peach, leave an emblem on me
Now I've got it all, why want anything else?

Big bold true
Bright proud new
When you step out
The world steps in to meet you
Big bold true
Bright proud new
When you step out
The world steps in to meet you

"better"

I'll blame the mono I got freshman year
And I'll blame the dropping out all on my bright and burgeoning career
Though I've been worried tired for almost 10 years straight
Now I've got time to sit home alone and sing praise of the world I often hate

And I haven't felt right since that day
I met him publicly, he told me I was safe
But what's lost if I've never changed?
And what he did to me is just another diddy I can play

I don't know why I don't wanna get better, I wanna stay the same
And I say that I'll figure it out once all of my songs are sang
Oh no, and I don't know why I don't wanna get better, I wanna stay the same
And I say that I'll figure it out once all of my songs are sang

I don't know why I don't wanna get better, I wanna stay the same
And I say that I'll figure it out once all of my songs are sang
Oh no, and I don't know why I don't wanna get better, I wanna stay the same
And I say that I'll figure it out once all of my songs are sang

"promised"

Face first in the public pool
Swerved off the interstate one night
Hurts most once you're home from school
You'd quit this out of spite

There's so many ways to call it a day
When you don't know where to go
Just let the little guy bright
In the crosswalk light
Guide you to where you need to go

Sometimes it's fortune
Sometimes it's fate
When you just miss the green light
But something's keeping you safe
While it's making you late
It's a wonder that you've made it all this time

At best you're the shape of you
In shadows on blinding flood light fields
That green apple shampoo
You're sculpted baby bell peels
You're dryer steam, you're someone's wet dream
Ice cream for a meal
You're singalongs to Christmas songs
Or a dog at your heels

Sleep long for the sheet prints it leaves on my face
Tomorrow isn't promised, but I woke today
I don't really care how long I get to stay
So long as I'm gone once I've felt everything

So long as I'm gone once I've felt everything

So long as I'm gone once I've felt everything

"flounder"

An artifact of human existence
Is fossilized inside of me
Lost languages, species forgotten
Under sediment beneath our feet

Now sugar babies, Mickey Mouse
Digitize your parents' house
Turns into the world we choose to see
But it made me heavy on the way
I fell down for a couple days
Flattened at the bottom of the sea

Now I'm a flounder
Flounder
Flounder, flounder
Now I'm a flounder
Flounder
Flounder, flounder

I'm trapped inside my frame of sight
So much wonder that I cannot see
Though I've only got eyes on one side
It isn't any less real to me

Now money talks but I can scream
Look at all this blue and green
Blend into the seashell in your hand
And I don't mind to devolve a bit
Learn to love the simple shit
Forget we sprouted legs and walked the sand

So I'm a flounder
Flounder
Flounder, flounder
So I'm a flounder
Flounder
Flounder, flounder

Now I'm happy I can be myself
Instead of somebody else
I'd never trade the beauty that I've seen

"jake's car"

It doesn't rain here, but I swear I thought it was beating
Last night on the AC that's been there ever since we moved in
And I go outside in dad's coat and the clothes that I slept in
And wave at the neighbors, the old guy next door thinks I'm flirting

And I can see all the way down the street in the early morning
When I borrow Jake's car 'cause I drive but I can't afford it
Yet

"fade"

I end up alone every night when you fall asleep next to me
It's nice to have you by my side to keep my body company

But I forged this
My creation
If it's not here it must be fake
'Cause sometimes
The backdrop
Seems to slip off and start to

Fade
Fade
Fade
Fade

I don't know how to use my words this time there's nothing coming out
You'd have to crawl inside to understand and peer out of my mouth

This dream I've
Been living
Has lasted one too many days
And somehow
I'm scared that
This feelings never gonna

Fade
Fade
Fade
Fade
Fade
Fade
Fade

"shape"

Seven years is all it takes
To completely exfoliate
Cells die off, regenerate
Leave a reminiscent shape

So, if I can wait five more
In this shape that I abhor
I'll sleep with an open door
Knowing you haven't touched a cell on my body
On my body
On my body
On my body

Now, my love carries the task
Of handling the aftermath
Can you smooth the looping lines
Of fingerprints before your time?

Patience with the jagged grooves
Of relics that I can't remove
Worn thin, washing up to you
Kiss me till the cells are new on my body
On my body
On my body
On my body

On my body
On my body
On my body
On my body

"ribbons"

I took off my clothes and ribbons
To see what it looks like, oh
I took off the face paint, no shame
It looks alright, oh

I wore the same clothes
Ten days in a row
(One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten)
Seems like I'm the same
But I don't know

I'm tired of pretty dresses
I'm tired of clean white linens
I'm tired of pretty dresses
I'm tired of tying ribbons, oh, oh

I'm the smell of a coat from out
In the cold, mmh
I'm a frozen mandarin skin
Frosty gold, oh

No fun to be sexy
On the websites
When I'm always
Shining the light

I'm tired of pretty dresses
I'm tired of clean white linens
I'm tired of pretty dresses
I'm tired of tying ribbons, oh, oh

For as much as I'd like to vaporize
Sometimes I'm happy as a clam
Because I am
Ooh

I'm tired of pretty dresses
I'm tired of clean white linens
I'm tired of pretty dresses
I'm tired of tying ribbons

I'm tired of pretty dresses
I'm tired of clean white linens
I'm tired of pretty dresses
I'm tired of tying ribbons
I'm tired of pretty dresses
I'm tired of clean white linens
I'm tired of pretty dresses
I'm tired of tying ribbons, oh, oh

"gold ring"

Oh he took me up
To the meadow above
And I parked at the lot down the street
Oh he took me up
And I said hes out of luck
But he stole a little fragment of me

It's a hand print
Indent on your sidewalk
Baked under the hot sun
Branded on your skin
It's a gold ring
Deep inside a junk drawer
Maybe it's forever
Maybe I'm not sure

Oh salt in the sea
Waves take cliffs more strong than me
So I'd ask could you be kind to what remains
Oh sliver of grief
Little stolen puzzle piece
Where I let the light shine through me every day

It's a hand print
Indent on your sidewalk
Baked under the hot sun
Branded on your skin
It's a gold ring
Deep inside a junk drawer
Maybe it's forever
Maybe I'm not sure

It's a hand print
Indent on your sidewalk
Baked under the hot sun
Branded on your skin
It's a gold ring
Deep inside a junk drawer
Maybe it's forever
Maybe I'm not sure

"flutterby"

Angel hair and butter eyes
I sit like a paradigm
I can stomach cold french fries
But I can't show it to him yet
Do I read him as a threat
I can't show it to him yet

There's a moat on all my sides
You can't cross but always try
Only costs a pair of dimes
To fake you took off all my skin
I laugh silent with a grin
There is nothing stored within

I can't seem to verbalize
So he visits late at night
Tries so hard to get me high
When I wanna go to bed
But you're not finished yet
I just wanna go to bed
But you're not finished yet
I just wanna go to bed

Say he gives you butterflies
But sometimes that's just your insides
Telling you to flutterby
Maybe something isn't right
Can I stay here for the night?
Feels like something isn't right

"miss u but"

I was up 'till three
Sewing patches on my jeans
'Cos you don't kiss the bruises on my knees
Anymore
Hear you're fixating someone new
How you made me fixate on you
I miss you but I'm not allowed to
Anymore

Your new girl, she's got a name just like a song
And I wouldn't blame u if u sing it all night long
Your new girl, she's got a name just like a prayer
I couldn't blame you if you incant it everywhere

And I'm texting you at night time
And I hear its not the right time
Anymore
And I'm not dumb I'm just a kid
The worlds too small, my heart too big
They say I can't care what you did
Anymore

Your new girl, she's got a name just like a song
And I wouldn't blame you if you sing it all night long
Your new girl, she's got a name just like a prayer
I couldn't blame you if you incant it everywhere

"pity party"

Leave me at the pity party
Leave me at the pity party

Please don't drive me home tonight
I wouldn't want to ruin your fun
Im anybody's parasite
And your not just anyone

Leave me at the pity party
Leave me at the pity party
Leave me at the pity party
Leave me at the...

In the bathtub you talk to me
Tell me who treats me wrong
Outside they've got people to be
We try to not belong

Leave me at the pity party
Leave me at the pity party
Leave me at the pity party
Leave me at the...

Please don't drive me home tonight
Please don't drive me home tonight

"spilt milk"

And since when do we find well fed lovers on our minds and in our covers, kitchen, sitting watching you consume the things you need

Sitting pretty I believed that interesting means misery as lovers rot away mouth to my hand from which to feed

And staring at your shark tooth smile I recall that its been a while since you said that you think I look like that celebrity

And I'll say love me lingering, despite this constant dwindling as I am learning quickly you seek no dependency

Getting off on my guilt
Guess thats just how I'm built
You know where to find me I'll be sipping on that spilt milk

Getting off on my guilt
Guess thats just how I'm built
You know where to find me I'll be sipping on that spilt milk

Getting off on my guilt
Guess thats just how I'm built
You know where to find me I'll be sipping on that spilt milk

Getting off on my guilt
Guess thats just how I'm built
You know where to find me I'll be sipping on that spilt milk
