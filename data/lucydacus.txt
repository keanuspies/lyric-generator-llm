"I Don't Wanna Be Funny Anymore"

I don't wanna be funny anymore
I don't wanna be funny anymore
Lately, I've been feeling like the odd man out
I hurt my friends saying things I don't mean out loud

I don't wanna be funny anymore
I got a too short skirt, maybe I can be the cute one
Is there room in the band? I don't need to be the front man
If not, then I'll be the biggest fan

I don't want the joke to be on me
Yeah, I'll buy the clothes and I'll be the best dressed
Yeah, I'll read the books and I'll be the smartest
I'll play guitar and I'll be the artist

Try not to laugh
I know it'll be hard
I'm serious
I know it's a first but

I don't wanna be funny anymore
Yeah, I'll be the gossip, hear it through the grape vine
Pass it on, she's done with the old times
That funny girl doesn't wanna smile for a while

"Troublemaker Doppelganger"

Is that a hearse or a limousine?
It's like I've seen it on the TV screen
She had the body of a beauty queen
Put on a pedestal for good hygiene

I saw a girl that looked like you
And I wanted to tell everyone to run away from her
Run away, run away!
It couldn't have been you but she had your eyes
Made for faking smiles and turning tides
Hands full of young men wrapped around her finger

They made you a throne out of magazines
They made you a crown out of peonies
She grew up as the pretty young thing
Let them look up her skirt on the backyard swing
Oh noâ¦

Daddy told you to stay indoors
And I can understand how a girl gets bored-
Too old to play and too young to mess around
She was a victim of the same disease
That's roaming the streets and bites when it please
And makes us wanna live forever or die in infamy

I wanna live in a world where I can keep my doors wide open
But who knows what'd get in and what'd get out
One of these nights, I'll sleep with the windows down
But not until that creature's in the pound

No child is born knowing there's an ugly or evil thing
When did my folks stop covering my eyes?
Was it my brother who taught me about jealousy?
Was it my sister who taught me about vanity?
Was it that girl, that beautiful girl
Thirsty for love and eager for attention
Was it that girl who taught me about destruction?

I wanna live in a world where I can keep my doors wide open
But who knows what'd get in and what'd get out?

"Green Eyes, Red Face"

Slow dancing
At low tide, low tide
Drawn to move
By the moon, by the moon

And I see the seat next to yours is unoccupied
And I was wondering if you'd let me come and sit by your side
I've got plenty of affection
I'd be glad to show you some time

Slow motion
In double time, double time
You are all
I can't deny

And I see the seat next to yours is unoccupied
And I was wondering if you'd let me come and sit by your side
I've got plenty of affection
I'd be glad to show you some time

What am I supposed to do
With you in the room?
What am I supposed to say
With your green eyes on my red face?
With your green eyes on my red face

"Strange Torpedo"

You got yourself a bunch of bad habits
Not hard to see that love is a weakness
Seems to me, the way you understand it
Is that you're never gonna make it happen

I get smoke in my eyes every time I try
To look you in the eye
Do I even know what your face looks like
Or just the cloud of smoke in it's place?
I'm trying to tell you something you might've heard before

You got a dollar in your pocket
You got a pebble in your sock and
You've got a mind of gold you keep secret
I gotta hope that one day you'll use it

I get tongue-tied every time I try
To tell you what I think is right
Cause I think it's wrong when you sit around
Looking like a toy in the lost and found
I am telling you something you might've heard before
And forgot on the spot

You're a strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
And I'll play the fool, and I'll play the fool

I see the blood rushing to your head
Your words are slurred and your cheeks are red
You'd do anything to stop pretending
Can't have regrets when you can't remember them

You are one of a kind, I cannot lie
You're wild when your body's in overdrive
And I'm more surprised every time you're alive
When I check for your breath in the morning

You're a strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
And I'll play the fool, and I'll play the fool

I thought you'd hit rock bottom
But I'm starting to think that it doesn't exist
Cause you've been falling for so long
And you haven't hit anything solid yet

I thought you'd hit rock bottom
But I'm starting to think that it doesn't exist
Cause you've been falling for so long
And you haven't hit anything solid yet

You're a strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
Strange torpedo on the loose
And I'll play the fool, and I'll play the fool, and I'll play the fool

"Dream State..."

We woke up to the thunder
We huddled under covers
We didn't say anything
If you hadn't come over
I would be so much colder
I would be much less confused

And then the water came
And washed it all away
It left me with nothing to say
Could not believe my eyes
I could not recognize
Your face in the rubble

Without you, I am surely the last of our kind
Without you, I am surely the last of my kind

We had a lot to measure
We had more past than pleasure
And time grows deep like weeds
You catch me when I'm falling
Sometimes, I wish you wouldn't
I can't tell if I'm learning

And then the water came
And washed it all away
It left me with nothing to say
Could not believe my eyes
I could not recognize
Your face in the rubble

Without you I am surely the last of our kind
Without you I am surely the last of my kind
Without you I am surely the last of our kind
Without you I am surely the last of my kind
Without you I am surely the last of our kind
Without you I am surely the last of my kind

"Trust"

I set a fire on the stove
And fed it every word I wrote
I watched my journals turn to smoke
Now all there is is what I spoke

I decided long ago
To make the most of what I know
And worry not of what I don't
Perfect the art of letting go

Cause if I trust in something else
Then I don't need to trust myself
I've learned a lot since I began
But I think I was wiser then

I've done too much and not enough
In trying to put you above
I cannot tell if I'm in love
Or whose regard I'm thinking of

If beauty is the only way
To make the nightmares go away
I'll plant a garden in your brain
And let the roots absorb the pain

I set a fire to my soul
I hope it ate til it was full
I set a fire to my soul
It burned me and it made me whole

"Map On A Wall"

Oh please, don't make fun of me
Of my crooked smile and my crowded teeth
Of my pigeon feet, of my knobby knees
Well, I got more problems than not

But I feel fine and I made up my mind
To live happily, feeling beautiful beneath the trees
Above a ground that's solid at the core
Oh please, don't make fun of me
Oh you know I get frightened so easily
When I'm all alone and the floorboards creak
It's those noises in the dark

But I am alive and I made up my mind
To live fearlessly, running wild beneath the trees
Above a ground that's solid at the core

Send my regards to the north my friends
I am built for the heat, I regret to admit
My fear of freezing keeps me on my feet
And so far my whole life's one long lucky streak
They say you should take the credit when it comes
But I believe in haunted wood

Oh please, don't make fun of me
Oh I'll try my best to tell it like it is
But I'll bite my tongue and I'll close my lips
When nobody wants to hear it

But here we are and something about it doesn't feel like an accident
We're all looking for something to adore
And how to survive the bending and breaking

I've walked on two legs since I was a child
But when did I realize that some ways out
Past the horizon for thousands of miles
There are people like me, walking on legs like mine?

Coming closer and farther away
Coming to me and from my embrace
Hoping good comes from good
And good comes from bad anyway

Oh please, don't make fun of me
With my heart of gold and my restless soul
Oh please, don't make fun of me
This smile happens genuinely

If you want to see the world, you have to say goodbye
Cause a map does no good hanging on a wall
If you want to see the world, you have to say goodbye
Cause a map does no good hanging on a wall

"Direct Address"

You know it's unfair that I am here and you are there
I feel short in the exchange- I show you mine you walk away
I'm wearing mine out on my sleeve, you're wearing yours where I can't see
But I'll remember your face for years to come
And wonder what you thought about when you got home

Honesty is like a kiss on the lips
Come closer and I'll tell you exactly how it is
Now I'm barely breathing, I'm moving ahead
But if I see you smile, it's gonna knock me dead

I'm stiff in my tracks trying to recover
From whatever drug you used to put me under

I don't believe in love at first sight
I don't believe in love at first sight
It's hard enough for me to not fall in love with every person I see

I let my mind get turned inside out
Just to see what the kids were laughing about
It wasn't worth understanding something
I could've gone my whole life not knowing

You know what they say about curiosity
That murderer had his chokehold on me
I ran away without turning back
But every now and then I want what I can't have

I'm still thinking of a man from years ago-
Eyes open wide in the front row
Dark features, leaning on the doorframe
I would've sold my soul to know his first name

I don't believe in love at first sight
I don't believe in love at first sight
I don't believe in love at first sight
Maybe I would if you looked at me right

"...Familiar Place"

I came through the backyard
You let the garden die
How did I get here?
How did I get here?
What did I do to deserve this?

The mountain was taller than I could've fathomed
I hardly believe it from here at the bottom
I can't imagine why you'd want to be at the top
Oh my god, what will I do if you ever stop?

Without you, I am surely the last of our kind
Without you, I am surely the last of my kind

"Night Shift"

The first time I tasted somebody else's spit, I had a coughing fit
I mistakenly called them by your name
I was let down it wasn't the same

I'm doing fine, trying to derail my one track mind
Regaining my self-worth in record time
But I can't help but think of your other in the bed that was mine

Am I a masochist, resisting urges to punch you in the teeth, call you a bitch and leave?
Why did I come here? To sit and watch you stare at your feet?
What was the plan? Absolve your guilt and shake hands?

I feel no need to forgive but I might as well
But let me kiss your lips so I know how it felt
Pay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down
Walk for hours in the dark feeling all hell

Don't hold your breath, forget you ever saw me at my best
You don't deserve what you don't respect
Don't deserve what you say you love and then neglect

Now bite your tongue, it's too dangerous to fall so young
Take back what you said
Can't lose what you never had

I feel no need to forgive but I might as well
But let me kiss your lips so I know how it felt
Pay for my coffee and leave before the sun goes down
Walk for hours in the dark feeling all hell

You got a 9 to 5, so I'll take the night shift
And I'll never see you again if I can help it
In five years I hope the songs feel like covers
Dedicated to new lovers

You got a 9 to 5, so I'll take the night shift
And I'll never see you again if I can help it
In five years I hope the songs feel like covers
Dedicated to new lovers

You got a 9 to 5, so I'll take the night shift
And I'll never see you again if I can help it
In five years I hope the songs feel like covers
Dedicated to new lovers

"Addictions"

Freeze frame, tidal wave in the passenger side
I'm still a nervous kid after all this time
Can you imagine what it's like to be here with you now?
Forget your current lover, remember me that one July?
Lay in bed, black under oaths, watching the planes at night
I knew one day it'd be so hard to have you by my side

Now I'm awake at 2AM
Without a cause to draw you in

Buy low, sell high kind of guy
Invest your time in what's worthwhile
Was I a risk without reward or did I make you proud?

Now I'm awake at 2AM
Without a cause to draw you in

I'm just calling 'cause I'm used to it
You pick up 'cause you're not a quitter
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too

You've been around the world and back
Always return to the ones you love
You've got a sense of adventure
An adventure for comfort that keeps you at home

I'm just calling 'cause I'm used to it
You pick up 'cause you're not a quitter
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too

Releasing
Years of senseless waiting
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too
You've got addictions too, it's true
You've got addictions too

"The Shell"

I'm a ghost
Walking in a boring dream
You are there
Talking and I'm not listening
I am busy doing nothing
And you're rudely interrupting

It's a myth and now I see it clearly
You don't have to be sad to make something worth hearing
Now I'm calm and content
One more burden off my back

You don't wanna be a creator
Doesn't mean you've got nothing to say
Put down the pen, don't let it force your hand

I'm a ghost
Walking on an empty street
No name anymore
No need to call for me
I'm a long-lost hometown hero
Late to legendary past lives within me

If I had the offer to do it again
Make me invincible, invisible, or brain dead
If the body and the life were two things that we could divide
I'd deliver up my shell to be filled with somebody else

You don't wanna be a creator
Doesn't mean you've got nothing to say
Put down the pen, don't let it force your hand

You don't wanna be a leader
Doesn't mean you don't know the way
Hold your own hand, walk on without a plan

"Nonbeliever"

You threw your books into the river
Told your Mom that you're a non-believer
She says she wasn't surprised but that doesn't make it ok

You say nobody loves a city
Nobody loves what can't love 'em back
One-way ticket in your pocket
What happened to the charm of a small town?

If you find what you're looking for
Be sure to send a postcard
You promised you'd never forget
The little ones when you got big

You deal an unspoken debt
No kindness without wanting something back
What do I owe you? What did I forget?
Are we even after all of that?

You shook my hand and said goodbye
You'll never let me see you cry again
What good has come from learning to pretend?
You said I could've been a better friend

If you find what you're looking for
Be sure to send a new address
And if you find what you're looking for
Write a letter and tell us what it is, and tell us what it is

Everybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out
Everybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out
Everybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out
Everybody else, everybody else looks like they've figured it out

"Yours & Mine"

I'm afraid of pain
Both yours and mine
Both yours and mine
I'm afraid of pain
From where it comes
And where it falls

Somebody lit the store on fire
Somebody lit the house on fire
Somebody lit the crowd on fire
Marching away and you've got nothing to say
You've got nothing to say
Have you got nothing to say?

For those of you who told me I should stay indoors
Take care of you and yours
Take care of you and yours
But me and mine (me and mine)
Me and mine (me and mine)
We've got a long way to go
Before we get home
'Cause this ain't my home anymore
This ain't my home anymore
This ain't my home

Somebody lit the store on fire

"Body To Flame"

(Huh)
Longing for your short hair to grow back to the way you like
Thank you for the gesture
I regret ever implying that you could be better
Didn't mean to empty your perfect body
And fill it with my passing will

Easily won, weary of losing, gullible girl
Weak and alluring, well we break our rules
Get drunk in the dark
Laughing aloud at the spinning stars

Believe me, I'm speaking plainly and painfully
Trying to stay elegant, eloquent and akin to you
I see you holding your breath with your arms outstretched
Waiting for someone to come rip open your chest

You take me aside
To solemnly confide
When it comes the time
You plan to give your body to the flame

"Timefighter"

And I'll get old
And I'll get tired
And I won't run
Into the water
You gotta let me go down
Will you remember me as I am now?

And I know you're strong
I know you're a manmade fortress
But we're alone
And I'm so willing to be proven wrong

And I fight time
It won in a landslide
I'm just as good as anybody
I'm just as bad as anybody

You talk like you know the walls are thin
And I don't mind if you don't mind me listening
And I'm tired of all these wires
If I go far enough
Will they not follow us?

And I fight time
It won in a landslide
I'm just as good as anybody
I'm just as bad as anybody

And I fight time
It won in a landslide
I'm just as good as anybody
I'm just as bad as anybody

"Next Of Kin"

Reading in the phone booth
Sucking on a ginger root
I never got to talk to you
Why is this the image I come back to?
Pick my jewelry from the ash
Find the box with the cold hard cash in it
Give it to the next of kin

I used to be too deep inside my head
Now I'm too far out of my skin
Too far out of my skin
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed

I make a desert of my mind
Unfold myself so flat and wide
Have nothing in mind in sight
No cover for my thoughts to hide
Never entered my code
But I held your hand in the pocket of my coat
I learned to be loving and then to be alone
Satisfied body and a hungry soul

I used to be too deep inside my head
Now I'm too far out of my skin
Too far out of my skin
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed
I am at peace with my death
I can go back to bed

I don't wanna be that man on the train
On a grey commute, imagining fame
Sweet relief, I will never be complete
I will never be complete
I'll never know everything
I will never be complete
I will never be complete
I will never be complete
I'll never know everything

I used to be too deep inside my head
Now I'm too far out of my skin
Too far out of my skin

"Pillar Of Truth"

Your hands are folded
Your eyes are closing
Your words are broken
Your eyes are dry

I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust
I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust

You are your mother's child
You're a mother of a mother of a mother now
Raised in the age of the milkman
I can't claim to understand

I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust
I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust

Lord, prepare me
For the shadows
For the sparrows
At my window
Lord, have mercy
On my descendants
For they know not
What they do
For they know not
Who you are
And they know not
What to do

I, the anchor
I'm slowly sinking
Into darkness
Yet unknown
But the fading
Light around me
Is full of faces
Who carry my name

I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust
I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust

Lord, be near me
My final hour
I once had sight
But now I'm blind
Oh, I tried to be
A second coming
And if I want
Nobody knew
If my throat can't sing
Then my soul
Screams out to you!

I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust
I am weak looking at you
A pillar of truth
Turning to dust

"Historians"

You said "Don't go changing
I'll rearrange to let you in
And I'll be your historian
And you'll be mine
And I'll fill pages of scribbled ink
Hoping the words carry meaning"

Then one day, the motorcade
Covered in flower wreaths
First in a big parade
Will come to take one of us away
Leaving the other with plenty to read

This is what I want to talk about
But somehow the words will not leave my mouth
Was I most complete at the beginning? Or the bow?
If past you were to meet future me
Would you be holding me here and now?

"Fool's Gold"

I drank the dregs of the champagne alone
Warm, flat, coppery coins down my throat
I'm saving up for a rainy day
And I plan to spend it in one place
I threw the party so I could stay put
You brought the bottle like a promise I forgot
A new year begins, it ushers us in
The knot in my gut is coming with

He'll blame the alcohol
And you'll blame the full moon
She'll blame the fall of man
But I blame the part of you
That can't let up on the reigns
You've got life in a chokehold
You say that it's all the same
All glittering fool's gold

I can't tell how big my heart is
Let's open the doors, see how many fit
Like drunks in a bathtub keep piling in
Now I'm locking the door till the morning

He'll blame the alcohol
And you'll blame the full moon
She'll blame the fall of man
And I blame the evening news
For giving us doomsday
And dropping the ball
Building our fear
Like bricks in a wall
He'll blame his mom and dad
And you'll say you understand
She'll blame the wrath of God
And I come up empty-handed
Every time he cries out
You'll blame the altitude
She'll blame society
But I blame the part of you
That can't let up on the reigns
You've got life in a chokehold
You say that it's all the same
All glittering fool's gold

"My Mother & I"

My mother hates her body
We share the same outline
She swears that she loves mine
I blur at the edges
I'm all soft shapes and lines
Shapeshifting all the time

The stars have a lot to say
About babies born in the month of May
We are down-to-earth
We see eye-to-eye
We dig our feet in
My mother and I
My mother and I

They called me an old soul
When I was too young to know
The difference between a soul and a ghost
I feared what was inside
Trapped in my body
Kept from the outside
A spirit searching for a second life

The stars have a lot to say
About women born in the month of May
We want love
Warm and forever
We want to die in the presence of our loved ones
My mother and I
My mother and I

All she has given
All I have taken
All is forgiven
All is forsaken

"Forever Half Mast"

I'm takin' back roads all the way back home
Everything I've done, just a little lovely crow
I didn't choose this town, I can't undo it now
I tried to love the beast no matter what it thinks of me

You're worried that you'll go to Hell
For all the lives that you can't save
For all the money that you waste
For all the good you throw away

Yes, you're evil, but you're not that bad
You put out your palm more than the back of your hand
They were wrong when they said forget the past
Let your flag fly at forever half mast
Let your flag fly at forever half mast

We're in a state of disarray united by our darkest days
Achin' from the growing pains, they always say it's just a phase
America, the tried and true, red and white and black and blue
Tell me, who did this to you? If it was me I hardly knew

Yes, you're evil, but you're not that bad
You put out your palm more than the back of your hand
They were wrong when they said forget the past
Let your flag fly at forever half mast
Let your flag fly at forever half mast

Off you run and run for more
Nobody escaped before
Wait for something magical
Mistake turn into miracle

"Last Christmas"

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

Marry Christmas
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying "I love you", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover, but you tore me apart
Now I've found a real love
You'll never fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

"Hot & Heavy"

Being back here makes me hot in the face
Hot blood in my pulsing veins
Heavy memories weighing on my brain
Hot and heavy in the basement of your parents' place
You used to be so sweet
Now you're a firecracker on a crowded street
Couldn't look away even if I wanted
Try to walk away but I come back to the start

Get me to the floor even though I'm not a dancer
Ask me all the questions that your parents wouldn't answer
How could I deny it, diamond in the rough
You let me in your world until you had enough
You knew that I wanted you to bend the rules
How did I believe I had a hold on you
You were always stronger than people suspected
Underestimated and overprotected
When I went away it was the only option
Couldn't trust myself to proceed with caution
The most that I could give to you is nothing at all
The best that I could offer was to miss your calls

Being back here makes me hot in the face
Hot blood in my pulsing veins
Heavy memories weighing on my brain
Hot and heavy in the basement of your parents' place
You used to be so sweet
Now you're a firecracker on a crowded street
Couldn't look away even if I wanted
Try to walk away but I come back to the start

And it happens over and over, and over and over again
Over and over, and over and over again
I wish I was over it, over it, over it, over it

A hidden gem, my own goldmine
You had the wide and wild eyes
You were a secret to yourself
You couldn't keep from anyone else
Now you're the biggest brightest flame
You are a fire that can't be tamed
You're better than ever, but I knew you when
It's bittersweet to see you again

"Christine"

You're falling asleep on my shoulder in the back of your boyfriend's car
We're coming home from a sermon saying how bent and evil we are
I tried to imagine what you're dreaming, you're muttering nonsense between steady breathing
I have to wake you up to get out, your man waves from the end of the drive 'til I'm in the house

He can be nice, sometimes
Other nights, you admit he's not what you had in mind
All in all, nobody's perfect
There may be better, but you don't feel worth it
That's where we disagree

You always wanted to raise a baby by the lake
Maybe they'll grow up and never make the same mistakes
Knowing you, they'd be the first kid to never hurt another
I see you look at him and wonder if he'll make you a mother

But if you get married, I'd object
Throw my shoe at the altar and lose your respect
I'd rather lose my dignity
Than lose you to somebody who won't make you happy

"First Time"

Broke into the screened-in porch
Now I'm crawling through the dog door
I may let you see me on my knees
But you never see me on all fours

Drooling on the tile
I'm a starfish on the kitchen floor
Catch my breath to breathe your name
I'm just the fool you took me for

You can feel it for the first time, the second time
You can feel it for the first time, the second time

You gave me your hands 'cause you
Didn't know what to with them
And I showed you the way
Even though I'd never been

Where did we go right?
I think about it all the time
If I had paid closer attention
Maybe I could take us back to there and then

You can feel it for the first time, the second time
You can feel it for the first time, the second time
I can't go back to who I was before I met you
I can't undo with I've done, I wouldn't want to
I wouldn't want to, I wouldn't want to

Sneaking out of the house
I must be out of my mind
I'm running out of excuses
We're running out of time

You say the love will come and go
We'll learn to rude the ebb and flow
You always leave before the light
Come back, same time and place the next night

And how will I know if history repeats itself
How will I know when it's gonna come back around?
How will I know? Has my face changed, baby?
How will I know? I'll stay ready for you to take me
Take me, take me
Take me

"VBS"

In the summer of '07 I was sure I'd go to heaven
But I was hedging my bets at VBS
The preacher in a t-shirt told me I could be a leader
Taught me how to build a fire and to spread the word

In the evening everybody went to worship and weep
Hands above our heads, reaching for God
Back in the cabin, snorting nutmeg in your bunk bed
You were waiting for a revelation of your own

Sedentary secrets like peach pits in your gut
Locked away like jam jars in the cellar of your heart
Waiting to be tasted and ultimately wasted
You were gonna win me over from the start

The poetry was so bad
It took a lot to not laugh
You said that I showed you the light
But all it did in the end
Was make the dark feel darker than before

Your dad keeps his sleeves down through the summer for a reason
Your mother wears her makeup extra thick for a reason
When I tell you you were born and you are here for a reason
You are not convinced the reason is a good one

While you're going to sleep your mind keeps you awake
And it makes your heart beat fast and loud
There's nothing you can do but the only thing you found
Playing Slayer at full volume helps to block it out

The poetry was so bad
It took a lot to not laugh
You said that I showed you the light
But all it did in the end
Was make the dark feel darker than before
Dark feel darker than before
Dark feel darker than before

"Cartwheel"

Here and there and gone again
Firefly juice on your skin
You're glowing like an atom bomb
This natural thing that you've undone
Outgrew older sister's clothes again
Won't admit you're growing tall and thin
You like your body pulling at the seams
You're not prepared for what the future brings

Curse words and empty cups
Cracked blacktop curling up
Heatwave by midday
Heat lightning on a summer night
And I remember when you used to call
Holed up in the closet in the hall
Scared you wouldn't live to 45
The same age as your father when he died
You'd say, "We need to talk
Sneak out, meet me on your block"
I'd sit by you, silent on the curb
What to say when there is not a word?
Spell broke at daybreak
Light another candle on the cake
Cartwheel and a broken wrist
Skin scarred and sun-kissed

When you told me 'bout your first time
A soccer player at the senior high
I felt my body crumple to the floor-
Betrayal like I'd never felt before
I thought back to many years ago
A late night promise on the telephone
We'd build a house of twigs and vines
Grow old together just to pass the time
Now there's only past and present day
I can't believe a word you say
The future isn't worth its weight in gold
The future is a benevolent black hole

"Thumbs"

You hung up the phone
And I asked you what was wrong
Your dad has come to town
He'd like to meet
I said "You don't have to see him"
But for whatever reason you can't tell him no

So we meet him at a bar
You were holding my hand hard
He ordered rum and coke
I can't drink either anymore
He hadn't seen you since the fifth grade
Now you're nineteen and you're five-eight
He said "Honey, you sure look great
Do you get the checks I send on your birthday?"

I would kill him
If you let me
I would kill him
Quick and easy
Your nails are digging
Into my knee
I don't know
How you keep smiling

I love your eyes
And he has them
But you have his
'Cause he was first
I imagine my thumbs on the irises
Pressing in until they burst

I clear my throat
And say we ought to get home
He offers us a ride
I reply "No, that's alright"
When we leave
You feel him watching
So we walk a mile in the wrong direction

I would kill him
If you let me
I would kill him
Quick and easy
Your nails are digging
Into my knee
I don't know
How you keep smiling
I don't know
How you keep smiling
I don't know
How you keep smiling

I wanna take your face between my hands and say
"You two are connected by a pure coincidence
Bound to him by blood, but baby, it's all relative
You've been in his fist ever since you were a kid
But you don't owe him shit even if he said you did
You don't owe him shit even if he said you did"

"Going Going Gone"

Daniel made a pass
We started flirting after class
Stealing hats and trading jackets
Locking lips and braces brackets
After dinner, before dark
We'd meet at the same bench in the park
Sweaty palms, averted eyes
Wasn't sure if he and I were going out

Going out
Going out, ooh
Going, going, out

The sunset threw a tantrum
It wasn't ready to go just yet
Mother Earth said, "Time for bed"
It resisted and the sky went red
The color filtered out
Like pulling teeth out of a cloud
The bloody battle ended
No, the sun can't break the habit of going down

Going down
Going down, ooh
Going, going, down

Daniel in ten years
Grabbing asses, spilling beers
Another ten and he'll have a daughter
She'll grow up and he can't stop her
Back on the bench, making plans
Watching the day end hand in hand
I always had to be home by eight
My dad would kill me if I was late
I'll be going now

Going now
Going now, ooh
Going, going, now

Going gone
Going gone
Going gone, ooh
Going, going, gone

"Cool, yeah that was the one I think"
"Yup that was great, that's what we were looking for. Thanks guys!"
"Cool, wow! I am so happy. Thank you everyone for doing this. I owe y'all whatever you ask of me for the rest of my life"

"Partner in Crime"

When I asked you to coffee
Could you tell I don't drink it?
When I got to the cafÃ©
Could you tell what I was thinking?
My heart's on my sleeve, it's embarrassing
The pulpy thing, beating

When you asked my age, I lied
I saw relief dawn on your eyes
It's not your fault, it's mine
Let the record show
I walked in on my own

Knee deep in the city that never sleeps
I lay down in the middle of the street
Lamplight like parallel suns
Crowding out the early morning stars
Concrete holding heat from the daytime
Picking petals to see if you will be mine

Do you love me, do you love me not?
Do you love me, do you love me not?
Do you love me, do you love me not?
Do you love me, do you love me, not

You were my partner in crime
It was a welcome waste of time
Eating cherries on the bridge, feet dangling
Throwing the pits and stems into the racing current below
I get vertigo looking down, and looking in

Drop me off at the curb by my curfew
Round the corner so nobody sees you
You drop a hint that you got a girlfriend
I tried my best not to take it
I wanna run my fingers through you
You say nobody understands you like I do

But do you love me, do you love me not?
Do you love me, do you love me not?
Do you love me, do you love me not?
Do you love me, do you love me, not

"Brando"

You told me to skip school
To go with you to the movies
You knew you were uncool
But you thought you could fool me
They play oldies in the afternoon
For the elderly, and me and you
Fred and Ginger, black and white
I watch you watch 'It's a Wonderful Life'

You called me cerebral
I didn't know what you meant
But now I do, would it have killed you
To call me pretty instead?
I'm in a second story window
And you're yelling at me "Stella!"
And I'm laughing 'cause you think you're Brando
But you'll never come close

All I need for you to admit
Is that you never knew me like you thought you did
You never knew me like you thought you did
Like you thought you did

You say, "Here's looking at you kid"
Thinking I wouldn't understand the reference
You admit, you think we're fated
I'll be lucky if I'm your third wife
That's only something you would say in the car
We've been breathing the same air for too long
If the snow wasn't coming down so hard
I would open the door and walk home
It's only a couple miles
What could go wrong
If I hitch a ride with a guy in a pick-up
Who doesn't know left, from right, from wrong?

All I need for you to admit
Is that you never knew me like you thought you did
You never knew me like you thought you did
Like you thought you did

All I need for you to admit
Is that you never knew me like you thought you did
You never knew me like you thought you did
Like you thought you did

"Please Stay"

Your clothes in the dryer
Your hair on the shower wall
Your toothbrush is too much
Your shoes empty in the hall
Your keys on the counter
Your dirty dish in the sink
Please, don't make me see these things

The books on your shelf that you never read
The hunting knife you kept by your bed
The flowers you dried and tied up with twine
Suspended from the ceiling

You tell me you love me, like it'll be the last time
Like you're playing out, the end of a storyline
I say I love you too, because it's true
What else am I supposed to do?
Maybe bar the door when you move to leave

I think you mean what you say
When you say you wanna die
I think you mean what you say
When you say you want to stay alive

Quit your job
Cut your hair
Get a dog
Change your name
Change your mind
Change your ways
Give them time
Go back to school, go back to sleep
Tell the secret you can't keep
Begin, be done
Break a vow, make a new one
Call me if you need a friend, or never talk to me again

But please stay
But please stay
But please stay
But please stay

"Triple Dog Dare"

I'm not tired yet
We still got a lot to figure out
Like what was the end of the movie about, anyways?
You're yawning on your couch
I wonder if I overstayed my welcome
Until you asked me if I'd like to take a walk
We're going to the five and dime
The only open place at this time of night
You're dancing in the aisle 'cause the radio
Is singing you a song you know
And the kid at the counter is gawking at your grace
I can tell what he's thinking by the look on his face
It's not his fault, I'm sure I look the same
It's what you do but it's not you I blame

Your mama read my palm
She wouldn't tell me what it was she saw
But after that, you weren't allowed to spend the night
I'm staring at my hands
Red, ruddy skin, I don't understand
How did they betray me? What did I do?
I never touched you how I wanted to
What can I say to your mom to let you come outside?
You know I'll be seeking if you run and hide
If the door were to open, would you walk through the frame?
If you're too afraid, it won't be you I blame

You passed a note in class
Told me to meet you at the overpass
Your lip was trembling when you said that we are cursed
You're trying not to cry
When you tell me you're afraid that we may die
I said "So what? Everybody's scared of that"
I want you to tell me that you miss me
Want you to hold and hurt and kiss me
I wanna run away and live on your family's boat
It's a triple dog dare, you're a chicken if you don't
I can fish for our food and you know how to start a flame
If you don't get out now you'll only have yourself to blame

You said, "You have me there
If it's a triple dog dare"
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare
A triple dog dare

They put our faces on the milk jugs
Missing children 'til they gave up
Your mama was right, and through the grief
Can't fight the feeling of relief
Nothing worse could happen now
Nothing worse could happen now
Nothing worse could happen now

"Kissing Lessons"

Rachel was a year older
When I was in the second grade
I thought she might know everything
I took her word like a golden ring
I asked her how to win my man
And she said, "I know just the thing"
Gave me lipgloss and a hair toss
And, after school, a lesson in kissing

She called me by the name of a crush
I couldn't decide if she was Cole or Justin
I think I called her baby or darling most the time

We'd take turns being seduced
Imagining the day it would come into use
Imagining the day we'd start breaking hearts
And taking names

She wanted a three-story house
I wanted to live by a body of water
With my children and their father
Children and their father
Three sons and a beautiful daughter (Oh)

Rachel's family moved out of town
I don't remember when we stopped hanging out
But I still wear a letter R charm on my bracelet
And wonder if she thinks of me as her first kiss

"Thumbs Again"

You hung up the phone
And I asked you what was wrong
Your dad has come to town
He'd like to meet
I said, "You don't have to see him"
But for whatever reason, you can't tell him no

So we meet him at a bar

He said, "Honey, you sure look great
Do you get the checks I send on your birthday?"

I would kill him
If you let me
I would kill him
Quick and easy
Your nails are digging
Into my knee
I don't know how you keep smiling

I love your eyes
And he has 'em
Or you have his
'Cause he was first
I imagine my thumbs on the irises
Pressing in until they burst

I clear my throat
And say we ought to get home
He offers us a ride
I reply, "No, that's alright"
