"Take Me To Church"

My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner

If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week

"We were born sick," you heard them say it

My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you

I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well
Aaay. Amen. Amen. Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the Goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice

Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine-looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful

That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No Masters or Kings
When the Ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin

In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean
Ooh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

"Angel Of Small Death & The Codeine Scene"

I watch the work of my kin bold and boyful
Toying somewhere between love and abuse
Calling to join them the wretched and joyful
Shaking the wings of their terrible youths
Freshly disowned in some frozen devotion
No more alone or myself could I be
Lurched like a stray to the arms that were open
No shortage of sordid, no protest from me

With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh I
Lay my heart down with the rest at her feet
Fresh from the fields, all fetor and fertile
It's bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet

With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

Leash-less confusion I wander the concrete
Wonder if better now having survived
Jarring of judgment and reasons defeat
The sweet heat of her breath in my mouth I'm alive

With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

"Jackie And Wilson"

So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes
No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
So deep in this swill with the most familiar of swine
For reasons wretched and divine

She blows outta nowhere, roman candle of the wild
Laughing away through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would rather be tonight
And, Lord, she found me just in time

'Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
I need to be youthfully felt 'cause, God, I never felt young

She's gonna save me
Call me "baby"
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy
Soothe me daily
Better yet she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus
Be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children
Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

Lord, it'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
Sit back and watch the world go by

Happy to lie back watch it burn and rust
We tried the world, good God, it wasn't for us

She's gonna save me
Call me "baby"
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy
Soothe me daily
Better yet she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus
Be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children
Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

Cut clean from the dream at night let my mind reset
Looking up from a cigarette, and she's already left
I start digging up the yard for what's left of me and our little vignette
For whatever poor soul is coming next

She's gonna save me
Call me "baby"
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy
Soothe me daily
Better yet she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus
Be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children
Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

"Someone New"

Don't take this the wrong way
You knew who I was with every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black days
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose

Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new

There's an art to life's distractions
To somehow escape the burning weight, the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else, I guess any thrill will do

Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

And so I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new

I wake at the first cringe of morning
And my heart's already sinned
How pure, how sweet a love, Aretha, that you would pray for him

'Cause God knows I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day

Love with every stranger, the stranger the better
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better
Love with every stranger, the stranger the better

I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh a little bit every day with someone new

"To Be Alone"

Never feel too good in crowds
With folks around, when they're playing
The anthems of rape culture loud
Crude and proud creatures baying
All I've ever done is hide
From our times when you're near me
Honey, when you kill the lights, and kiss my eyes
I feel like a person for a moment of my life

But you don't know what hell you put me through
To have someone kiss the skin that crawls from you
To feel your weight in arms I'd never use
It's the God that heroin prays to

It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh to be alone with you

There are questions I can't ask
Now at last the worst is over
See the way you hold yourself
Reel against your body's borders
I know that you hate this place
Not a trace of me would argue
Honey, we should run away, oh someday
Our baby and her momma
And the damaged love she made

But I don't know what else that I would do
Than try to kiss the skin that crawls from you
Than feel your weight in arms I'd never use
It's the God that heroin prays to

It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh to be alone with you
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh to be alone with you

"From Eden"

Babe, there's something tragic about you
Something so magic about you
Don't you agree?

Babe, there's something lonesome about you
Something so wholesome about you
Get closer to me

No tired sighs, no rolling eyes, no irony
No 'who cares', no vacant stares, no time for me

Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on its sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

Babe, there's something wretched about this
Something so precious about this
Where to begin

Babe, there's something broken about this
But I might be hoping about this.
Oh, what a sin

To the strand a picnic plan for you and me
A rope in hand for your other man to hang from a tree

Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on its sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on its sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to hide outside your door

"In A Week"
(feat. Karen Cowley)

I have never known peace like the damp grass that yields to me
I have never known hunger like these insects that feast on me
A thousand teeth and yours among them, I know
Our hunger's appeased, our heart beats becoming slow

We'll lay here for years or for hours
Thrown here or found, to freeze or to thaw
So long, we'd become the flowers
Two corpses we were, two corpses I saw

And they'd find us in a week
When the weather gets hot
After the insects have made their claim
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you

I have never known sleep like this slumber that creeps to me
I have never known color like this morning reveals to me
And you haven't moved an inch such that I would not know
If you sleep always like this, the flesh calmly going cold

We'll lay here for years or for hours
Your hand in my hand, so still and discreet
So long, we'd become the flowers
We'd feed well the land and worry the sheep

And they'd find us in a week
When the cattle'd show fear
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you

And they'd find us in a week (We'll lay here for years or for hours)
When the weather gets hot (So long, we'd become the flowers)
And they'd find us in a week (We'll lay here for years or for hours)
When the cattle'd show fear (So long, we'd become the flowers)

And they'd find us in a week
When the buzzards get loud
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
After the raven has had his say
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you

"Sedated"

Just a little rush, babe
To feel dizzy, to derail the mind of me
Just a little hush, babe
My veins are busy but my heart's in atrophy
Any way to distract and sedate
Adding shadows to the walls of the cave

You and I nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it

Something isn't right, babe
I keep catching little words but the meaning's thin
I'm somewhere outside my life, babe
I keep scratching but somehow I can't get in
So we're slaves to any semblance of touch
Lord we should quit but we love it too much

Sedated we're nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it

Darlin', don't you, stand there watching, won't you
Come and save me from it
Darlin', don't you, join in, you're supposed to
Drag me away from it

Any way to distract and sedate
Adding shadows to the walls of the cave

You and I nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it

Sedated we're nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it

"Work Song"

Boys workin' on empty
Is that the kinda way to face the burning heat?
I just think about my baby
I'm so full of love I could barely eat
There's nothing sweeter than my baby
I'd never want once from the cherry tree
Cause my baby's sweet as can be
She'd give me toothaches just from kissin' me

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

Boys, when my baby found me
I was three days on a drunken sin
I woke with her walls around me
Nothin' in her room but an empty crib
And I was burnin' up a fever
I didn't care much how long I lived
But I swear I thought I dreamed her
She never asked me once about the wrong I did

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

My babe would never fret none
About what my hands and my body done
If the Lord don't forgive me
I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me
When I was kissin' on my baby
And she put her love down soft and sweet
In the low lamp light I was free
Heaven and hell were words to me

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

"Like Real People Do"

I had a thought, dear
However scary
About that night
The bugs and the dirt
Why were you digging?
What did you bury
Before those hands pulled me
From the earth?

I will not ask you where you came from
I will not ask and neither should you

Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do

I knew that look dear
Eyes always seeking
Was there in someone
That dug long ago
So I will not ask you
Why you were creeping
In some sad way I already know

So I will not ask you where you came from
I would not ask and neither would you

Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do

I could not ask you where you came from
I could not ask and neither could you

Honey just put your sweet lips on my lips
We could just kiss like real people do

"It Will Come Back"

You know better babe, you know better babe
Than to look at it, look at it like that
You know better babe, you know better babe
Than to talk to it, talk to it like that

Don't give it a hand, offer it a soul
Honey, make this easy
Leave it to the land, this is what it knows
Honey, that's how it sleeps

Don't let it in with no intention to keep it
Jesus Christ! Don't be kind to it
Honey don't feed it - it will come back

You know better babe, you know better babe
Than to smile at me, smile at me like that
You know better babe, you know better babe!
Than to hold me just, hold me just like that

I know who I am when I'm alone
I'm something else when I see you
You don't understand, you should never know
How easy you are to need

Don't let me in with no intention to keep me
Jesus Christ! Don't be kind to me
Honey don't feed me - I will come back

It can't be unlearned
I've known the warmth of your doorways
Through the cold, I'll find my way back to you
Oh please, give me mercy no more!
It's a kindness you can't afford!
I want you baby tonight, as sure as you're born

You'll hear me howling outside your door
Don't you hear me howling babe?
Won't you hear me howling babe?
Don't you hear me howling babe?
Once you hear me howling, once you hear me howling, once you hear me howling babe!

"Foreigner's God"

She moved with shameless wonder
The perfect creature rarely seen
Since some liar brought the thunder
When the land was godless and free

Her eyes look sharp and steady
Into the empty parts of me
But still my heart is heavy
With the hate of some other man's beliefs

Always a well-dressed fraud
Who wouldn't spare the rod
Never for me

Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
The purest expression of grief

Wondering who I copy
Mustering some tender charm
She feels no control of her body
She feels no safety in my arms

I've no language left to say it
But all I do is quake to her
Breaking if I try convey it
The broken love I make to her

All that I've been taught
And every word I've got
Is foreign to me

Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
The purest expression of grief

Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
The purest expression of grief

Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
Screaming the name of a foreigner's god
The purest expression of grief

"Cherry Wine"

Her eyes and words are so icy
Oh but she burns
Like rum on a fire
Hot and fast and angry
As she can be
I walk my days on a wire

It looks ugly, but it's clean
Oh mamma, don't fuss over me

The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

Calls of guilty thrown at me
All while she stains
The sheets of some other
Thrown at me so powerfully
Just like she throws with the arm of her brother

But I want it, it's a crime
That she's not around most of the time

Way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

Her fight and fury is fiery
Oh but she loves
Like sleep to the freezing
Sweet and right and merciful
I'm all but washed
In the tide of her breathing

And it's worth it, it's divine
I have this some of the time

Way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

"In The Woods Somewhere"

My head was warm
My skin was soaked
I called your name
'Til the fever broke

When I awoke
The moon still hung
The night so black
That the darkness hums

I raised myself
My legs were weak
I prayed my mind
Be good to me

An awful noise
Filled the air
I heard a scream
In the woods somewhere

A woman's voice
I quickly ran
Into the trees
With empty hands

A fox it was
He shook afraid
I spoke no word
No sound he made

His bone exposed
His hind was lame
I raised a stone
To end his pain

What caused the wound?
How large the teeth?
I saw new eyes
Were watching me

The creature lunged
I turned and ran
To save a life
I didn't have

Deer in the chase
There as I flew
Forgot all prayers
Of joining you

I clutched my life
And wished it kept
My dearest love
I'm not done yet

How many years
I know I'll bear
I found something
In the woods somewhere

"Run"

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

Oh but the farrow know
Her hungry eye, her ancient soul
It's carried by the sneering menagerie

Know what it is to grow
Beneath her sky, her punishing cold
To slowly learn of her ancient misery

To be twisted by something
A shame without a sin
Like how she twisted the bog man
After she married him

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

But in all the world
There is one lover worthy of her
With as many souls claimed as she

But for all he's worth
He still shatters always on her earth
The cause of every tear she'd ever weep

Rushing ashore to meet her
Foaming with loneliness
White hands to fondle and beat her
Give her his onliness

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run 'til you feel your lungs bleeding

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

Rare is this love, keep it covered
I need you to run to me, run to me, lover
Run until you feel your lungs bleeding

"Arsonist's Lullabye"

[Humming]

When I was a child, I heard voices...
Some would sing and some would scream
You soon find you have few choices...
I learned the voices died with me

When I was a child, I'd sit for hours
Staring into open flame
Something in it had a power,
Could barely tear my eyes away

All you have is your fire...
And the place you need to reach -
Don't you ever tame your demons
But always keep 'em on a leash

[Humming]

When I was 16, my senses fooled me
Thought gasoline was on my clothes
I knew that something would always rule me...
I knew the scent was mine alone

All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons
But always keep 'em on a leash

When I was a man I thought it ended
When I knew love's perfect ache
But my peace has always depended
On all the ashes in my wake

All you have is your fire,
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons,
But always keep 'em on a leash...

"My Love Will Never Die"

You've done
Me wrong
For a long
Long time

But after all
You've done
I never changed
My mind

Honey please
Try to love me
Honey please
Honey try
My love will never die

Flowers
Flowers grow
Where I'm laid
To rest

Honey pick
A blossom
And hold it
Hold it
To your breast

Honey you know
That's my love
Bursting loud
From inside

My love
Oh my love my love
Will never die

"Nina Cried Power"
(feat. Mavis Staples)

[Hozier:]
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It is the grounding of a foot uncompromising
It's not forgoing of the lie
It's not the opening of eyes
It's not the waking, it's the rising

It's not the shade, we should be past it
It's the light, and it's the obstacle that casts it
It's the heat that drives the light
It's the fire it ignites
It's not the waking, it's the rising

It's not the song, it is the singing
It's the heaven of a human spirit ringing
It is the bringing of the line
It is the bearing of the rhyme
It's not the waking, it's the rising

[Hozier & Mavis Staples:]
And I could cry power (Power), power (Power)
Power, Lord
Nina cried power
Billie cried power
Mavis cried power
And I could cry (Power) power, (Power) power
Hey, power
Curtis cried power
Patti cried power
Nina cried power

[Hozier:]
It's not the wall, but what's behind it
Oh, the fear of fellow man, it's mere assignment
And everything that we're denied
By keeping the divide
It's not the waking, it's the rising

[Hozier & Mavis Staples:]
And I could cry power (Power), power (Power)
Oh, power
Nina cried power
Lennon cried power
James Brown cried power
And I could cry (Power) power, (Power) power
Hey, power
B.B. cried power
Joni cried power
Nina cried power

[Mavis Staples:]
And I could cry power
Power has been cried by those stronger than me
Straight into the face that tells you
To rattle your chains if you love being free

[Hozier & Mavis Staples:]
But I could cry power (Power)
'Cause power is my love when my love reaches to me
James Brown cried power
Seeger cried power
Marvin cried power
Yeah ah, power
James cried power
Lennon cried power
Patti cried power
Billie, power
Dylan, power
Woody, power
Nina cried power

"NFWMB"

When I first saw you
The end was soon
To Bethlehem
It slouched and then
Must've caught a good look at you
Give your heart and soul to charity
'Cause the rest of you, the best of you
Honey, belongs to me

Ain't it a gentle sound, the rolling in the graves?
Ain't it like thunder under earth, the sound it makes?
Ain't it exciting you, the rumble where you lay?

Ain't you my baby?
Ain't you my baby?

Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

If I was born as a black thorn tree
I'd wanna be felled by you, held by you
Fuel the pyre of your enemies
Ain't it warming you, the world goin' up in flames?
Ain't it the life where you you're lighting off the blaze?
Ain't it a waste it watch the throwing of the shade?

Ain't you my baby?
Ain't you my baby?

Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

"Moment's Silence (Common Tongue)"

When stunted hand earns place with man by mere monstrosity
Alarms are struck and shore is shook by sheer atrocity
A cure I know that soothes the soul, does so impossibly
A moment's silence when my baby puts her mouth on

Me and my babe relax and catch the manic rhapsody
All reason flown, as God looks on in abject apathy
A squall, and all of me is a prayer in perfect piety
A moment's silence when my baby puts her mouth on me

When the meaning is gone
There is clarity
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me

And it's easy done
Our little remedy
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me

What yields the need for those who lead us oh so morally
Those that would view the same we do through their deformity
Who view the deed as power's creed, as pure authority
This moment's silence when my baby puts her mouth on me

Since it all begun
To its reckoning
There the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me

Be thankful some know it lovingly
There the reason comes in the common tongue of your loving me

Like a heathen clung to the homily
Let the reason come on the common tongue of your loving me

So summon on the pearl rosary
Let the reason come on the common tongue of your loving me

"Shrike"

I couldn't utter my love when it counted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now
And I couldn't whisper when you needed it shouted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now

The words hung above
But never would form
Like a cry at the final breath that is drawn
Remember me love when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp
And glorious thorn

I had no idea on what ground I was founded
All of that goodness is going with you now
Then when I met you, my virtues uncounted
All of my goodness is going with you now

Dragging along
Follow in your form
Hung like the pelt of some prey you had worn
Remember me love when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp
And glorious thorn

I fled to the city with so much discounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now
Back to the hedgerows where bodies are mounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now

I was housed by your warmth
Thus transformed
By your grounded and giving
And darkening scorn
Remember me love when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp
And glorious thorn

"Nina Cried Power"
(feat. Mavis Staples)

[Hozier:]
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It is the grounding of a foot uncompromising
It's not forgoing of the lie
It's not the opening of eyes
It's not the waking, it's the rising

It's not the shade, we should be past it
It's the light, and it's the obstacle that casts it
It's the heat that drives the light
It's the fire it ignites
It's not the waking, it's the rising

It's not the song, it is the singing
It's the heaven of a human spirit ringing
It is the bringing of the line
It is the bearing of the rhyme
It's not the waking, it's the rising

[Hozier & Mavis Staples:]
And I could cry power (Power), power (Power)
Power, Lord
Nina cried power
Billie cried power
Mavis cried power
And I could cry (Power) power, (Power) power
Hey, power
Curtis cried power
Patti cried power
Nina cried power

[Hozier:]
It's not the wall, but what's behind it
Oh, the fear of fellow man, it's mere assignment
And everything that we're denied
By keeping the divide
It's not the waking, it's the rising

[Hozier & Mavis Staples:]
And I could cry power (Power), power (Power)
Oh, power
Nina cried power
Lennon cried power
James Brown cried power
And I could cry (Power) power, (Power) power
Hey, power
B.B. cried power
Joni cried power
Nina cried power

[Mavis Staples:]
And I could cry power
Power has been cried by those stronger than me
Straight into the face that tells you
To rattle your chains if you love being free

[Hozier & Mavis Staples:]
But I could cry power (Power)
'Cause power is my love when my love reaches to me
James Brown cried power
Seeger cried power
Marvin cried power
Yeah ah, power
James cried power
Lennon cried power
Patti cried power
Billie, power
Dylan, power
Woody, power
Nina cried power

"Almost (Sweet Music)"

I came in from the outside, burnt out from a joyride
She likes to roll here in my ashes anyway
Played from the bedside is Stella by Starlight
That was my heart, the drums that start off night and day

The same kind of music haunts her bedroom
I'm almost me again, she's almost you

I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

Tell me who and I'll be thanking 'em
The numbered lovers of Duke Ellington
Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek as soft as Chet can sing?
Let's get lost and let the good times roll
Let smoke rings from this paper doll
Blow sweet and thick 'til every thought of it don't mean a thing

I got some colour back, she thinks so, too
I laugh like me again, she laughs like you

I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know

The very thought of you and am I blue
A love supreme seems far removed
I get along without you very well some other nights
Oh the radio newsreader chimes
Reporting Russian lullabies
She'll turn to me, awake, and ask, 'Is everything alright?'

And, Lord, I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playin' in the dark
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start (I wouldn't know where)
Sweet music playin' in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

I wouldn't know where to start (I wouldn't know where)
Sweet music playin' in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start (I wouldn't know where)
Sweet music playin' in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me

"Movement"

I still watch you when you're groovin'
As if through water from the bottom of a pool
You're movin' without movin'
And when you move, I'm moved
You are a call to motion
There all of you a verb in perfect view
Like Jonah on the ocean
When you move, I'm moved

When you move
I'm put to mind of all that I wanna be
When you move
I could never define all that you are to me

So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby

You are the rite of movement
Its reasonin' made lucid and cool
And though it's no improvement
When you move, I move
You're less Polunin leapin'
Or Fred Astaire in sequins
Honey, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin'
And when you move, I'm moved

When you move
I can recall somethin' that's gone from me
When you move
Honey, I'm put in awe of somethin' so flawed and free

So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to prove
And nothin' to lose
Move me, baby

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh baby, oh baby
Move like grey skies
Move like a bird of paradise
Move like an odd sight come out at night

Move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to lose
And nothin' to prove
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby

"No Plan"

For starts
What a waste to say the heart could feel apart
Or feel complete, baby
Why would you make out of words
A cage for your own bird?
When it sings so sweet
The screaming, heaving, fuckery of the world?
Why would you offer a name
To the same old tired pain?
When all things come from nothin'
And honey, if nothin's gained?

My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
That's how I know now that you understand

There's no plan
There's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan
There's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan
There's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again

Let it hurl, let the awful song be heard
Blue bird, I know your beat, baby
But your secret is safe with me
'Cause if secrets were like seeds
Keep my body from the fire
Hire a gardener for my grave
Your secret is safe with me
And if secrets were like seeds
When I'm lying under marble
Marvel at flowers you'll have made

My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
That's how I know now that you understand

There's no plan
There's no race to be run
The harder the pain, honey, the sweeter the song
There's no plan
There's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan
There's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again

My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
That's how I know now that you understand
How big the hourglass, how deep the sand
I shouldn't have hoped to know, but here I stand

There's no plan
There's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan
There's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan
There's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again

"Nobody"

You know when it's twelve o'clock in Soho, baby
It's gin o'clock where I'll wake up, I don't know
And I think about you though everywhere I go
And I've done everything and I've been everywhere, you know

I've been fed gold
By sweet fools in Abu Dhabi
And I danced real slow
With Rockettes on dodgy Molly
But I've had no love like your love
Ooh from nobody

I'd be appalled if I saw you ever try to be a saint
I wouldn't fall for someone I thought couldn't misbehave
But I want you to know that I've had no love like your love

Honey, when you warm the bed on Wednesday
It's suicide Tuesday back in LA
If I had the choice between hearing either noise
The excitement of a thousand or the soothing of your voice

At first chance
I'd take the bed warmed by the body
I once warmed my hands
Over a burning Maserati
But I've had no love like your love
From nobody

I'd be appalled if I saw you ever try to be a saint
I wouldn't fall for someone I thought couldn't misbehave
But I want you to know that I've had no love like your love
And on the other side, why should we deny the truth?
We could have less to worry about, honey, I won't lie to you
But everything I do I've had no love like your love

"To Noise Making (Sing)"

Remember when you'd sing, just for the fuck of it?
And any joy it would bring
Honey, the look of it was as sweet as the sound
Your head tilt back, your funny mouth to the clouds
I couldn't hope to know that song and all its words
Wouldn't claim to feel the same we felt the first time it was heard
I couldn't name that feeling carried in that voice
Was it that or just the act of making noise that brought you joy?

You don't have to sing it right
But who could call you wrong?
To put your emptiness to melody
Your awful heart to song
You don't have to sing it nice, but, honey, sing it strong
At best, you find a little remedy, at worst the world will sing along

So honey, sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing
Sing, sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, sing

Remember when you'd sing before we'd move to it?
And we'd scuff up our shoes, honey, the groove of it
Was whatever you choose
"I Wanna Be Your Lover" or "The Fisherman's Blues"

You didn't always sing it right
But who could call you wrong?
To put your emptiness to melody
Your awful heart to song
You don't have to sing it nice, but, honey, sing it strong
At best, you find a little remedy, at worst the world will sing along

So honey, sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing
Sing, sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, sing

Who could ask you be unbroken or be brave again?
Or, honey, hope even on this side of the grave again?
And who could ask you to be sound or to feel saved again?
Just stick around until you hear that music play again

So honey, sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing
Sing, sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, sing
So honey, sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing
Sing, sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, sing
For the love of it
So honey, sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing
Sing, sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, and sing, sing
For the love of it

Remember when you'd sing, just for the love of it?
And any joy it would bring

"As It Was"

There is a roadway
Muddy and foxgloved
Whenever I'd had life enough
My heart is screaming of

And in a few days
I will be there, love
Whatever here that's left of me
Is yours just as it was

Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark,
The light, the flame

The highs hit the heights of my baby
And its hold had the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved

Tell me if somehow
Some of it remains
How long you would wait for me
How long I've been away

The shape that I'm in now
Your shape in the doorway
Make your good love known to me
Or just tell me about your day

Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark,
The light, the shame

The highs hit the heights of my baby
And its hold had the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved

And the sights were as stark as my baby
And the cold cut as sharp as my baby
And the nights were as dark as my baby
Half as beautiful too

"Shrike"

I couldn't utter my love when it counted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now
And I couldn't whisper when you needed it shouted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now

The words hung above
But never would form
Like a cry at the final breath that is drawn
Remember me love when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp
And glorious thorn

I had no idea on what ground I was founded
All of that goodness is going with you now
Then when I met you, my virtues uncounted
All of my goodness is going with you now

Dragging along
Follow in your form
Hung like the pelt of some prey you had worn
Remember me love when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp
And glorious thorn

I fled to the city with so much discounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now
Back to the hedgerows where bodies are mounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now

I was housed by your warmth
Thus transformed
By your grounded and giving
And darkening scorn
Remember me love when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp
And glorious thorn

"Talk"

I'd be the voice that urged Orpheus
When her body was found
Hey yeah
I'd be the choiceless hope in grief
That drove him underground
Hey yeah
I'd be the dreadful need in the devotee
That made him turn around
Hey yeah
And I'd be the immediate forgiveness
In Eurydice
Imagine being loved by me

I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things I would do
So I try to talk refined
For fear that you find out (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imagining you

I'd be the last shred of truth
In the lost myth of true love
Hey yeah
I'd be the sweet feeling of release
Mankind now dreams of
Hey yeah
That's found in the last witness before the wave hits
Marvelling at God
Hey yeah
Before he feels alone one final time
And marries the sea
Imagine being loved by me

I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things I would do
So I try to talk refined
For fear that you find out (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imagining you

I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things we could do
So I try to talk refined
For fear that you find out (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imagining you

"Be"

When all the worst we fear lets fall its weight
When the gyre widens on and when the wave breaks
When St. Peter loses cool and bars the Gates
When Atlas acts the maggot, makes his arms shake
When the birds are heard again in their singing
Once atrocity is hoarse from voicing shame
When the earth is trembling on some new beginning
With the same sweet shock of when Adam first came

Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been (lover, be good to me)

Be as you've always been (lover, be good to me)
Be like the love that discovered sin (lover, be good to me)
That freed the first man and will do so again
And lover, be good to me (lover, be good to me)
Be the hopeful feeling when Eden was lost (lover, be good to me)
That's been deaf to our laughter since the master was crossed (lover, be good to me)
Which side of the wall really suffers that cost
Oh lover, be good to me

When the man who gives the order
Is born next time around on the boat sent back
When the bodies starving at the border
Are on TV giving people the sack
Oh, when the sea rises to meet us
Oh when there's nothing left for you and I to do
Oh when there's nobody upstairs to receive us
When I have no kind words left, love for you now

Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been (lover, be good to me)

Be love in its disrepute (lover, be good to me)
That scorches the hillside and salts every root (lover, be good to me)
And watches the slowing and starving of troops
And lover, be good to me (lover, be good to me)
Be there and just as you stand (lover, be good to me)
Or be like the rose that you hold in your hand (lover, be good to me)
That will grow bold in a barren and desolate land
And lover, be good to me (lover, be good to me)

Love won't you be
Love won't you be
Be as you've always been?
Love won't you be
Love won't you be
Be as you've always been?
Love won't you be
Love won't you be
Be as you've always been?
Love won't you be
Love won't you be
Be as you've always been?

(Lover, be good to me)

"Dinner & Diatribes"

Honey this club here is stuck up
Dinner and Diatribes
I knew well from our first hookup
The look of mischief in your eye
Your friends are a fate that befell me
Hell is the talking type
I'd suffer hell if you'd tell me
What you'd do to me tonight

Tell me
Tell me
Tell me

That's the kinda love
I've been dreaming of
That's the kinda love
I've been dreaming of

Honey I laugh when it sinks in
A pillar, I am upright
Scarcely can speak for my thinking what
You'd do to me tonight
Now that the evening is slowing
Now that the end's in sight
Honey, it's easier knowing what
You'd do to me tonight

Tell me
Tell me
Tell your man

That's the kinda love
I've been dreaming of
That's the kinda love
I've been dreaming of

That's the kinda love
That's the kinda love
That's the kinda love
That's the kinda love...

Ohhhh
Let there be hotel complaints and grievances raised
And that kind of love
Ohhhh
Let there be damage ensued and tabloid news
And that kind of love

That's the kinda love
I've been dreaming of
That's the kinda love
I've been dreaming of

"Would That I"

True that I saw her hair like the branch of a tree
Willow dancing on air before covering me
Under cotton and calicos
Over canopy dapple long ago
True that love in withdrawal was the weeping of me
That the sound of the saw must be known by the tree
Must be felled for to fight the cold
I fretted fire but that was long ago

And it's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where I'm set alight (Oooh, oooh)
And I blink in sight (Oooh, oooh)
Your blinding light (Oooh)
Oh, it's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where you hold me tight (Oooh, oooh)
And the fire bright (Oooh, oooh)
Oh, let it blaze, alright (Oooh)

Oh, but you're good to me
Oh, you're good to me
Oh, but you're good to me, baby

With the roar of the fire my heart rose to its feet
Like the ashes of ash I saw rise in the heat
Settle soft and as pure as snow
I fell in love with the fire long ago
With each love I cut loose I was never the same
Watching still living roots be consumed by the flame
I was fixed on your hand of gold
Laying waste to my loving long ago

But that's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where I'm set alight (Oooh, oooh)
And I blink in sight (Oooh, oooh)
Of your blinding light (Oooh)
And it's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where you hold me tight (Oooh, oooh)
And the fire bright (Oooh, oooh)
Oh, let it blaze, alright, honey (Oooh)

Oh, but you're good to me
Oh, you're good to me
Oh, but you're good to me, baby

So in awe there I stood as you licked off the grain
Though I've handled the wood, I still worship the flame
Long as amber of ember glows
All the "would that I loved" is long ago

And it's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where I'm set alight (Oooh, oooh)
And I blink in sight (Oooh, oooh)
Of your blinding light (Oooh)
Oh, it's not tonight (Oooh, oooh)
Where you hold me tight (Oooh, oooh)
And the fire bright (Oooh, oooh)
Oh, let it blaze, alright (Oooh)

Oh, but you're good to me
Oh, you're good to me
Oh, but you're good to
Oh, you're good to me
You're good to me
Oh, but you're good to me, baby

"Sunlight"

I would shun the light
Share in evening's cool and quiet
Who would trade that hum of night
For sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
Whose heart would not take flight?
Betray the moon as acolyte
On first and fierce affirming sight
Of sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

I had been lost to you, sunlight
And flew like a moth to you, sunlight
Oh sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight

Oh, the tale is the same
Told before and told again
A soul that's born in cold and rain
Knows sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
At last can grant a name
To a buried and a burning flame
As love and its decisive pain
Oh my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

All that was shown to me, sunlight
Was something foreknown to me, sunlight
Oh sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Sunlight

All these colours fade for you only
Carry me slowly, my sunlight
All these colours fade for you only
Carry me slowly, my sunlight

Each day you rise with me
Know that I would gladly be
The Icarus to your certainty
Oh my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
Strap the wing to me
Death trap clad, happily
With wax melted I'd meet the sea
Under sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
Oh your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight

Sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

"Wasteland, Baby!"

All the fear and the fire of the end of the world
Happens each time a boy falls in love with a girl
Happens great, happens sweet
Happily, I'm unfazed here, too

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you

All the things yet to come are the things that have passed
Like the holding of hands, like the breaking of glass
Like the bonfire that burns
That all words in the fight fell to

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you

And I love too that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's just wasteland, baby

And that day that we'll watch the death of the sun
To the cloud and the cold and those jeans you have on
And you'll gaze unafraid as they sob from the city roofs

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you

And I love too that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's wasteland, baby

When the stench of the sea and the absence of green
Are the death of all things that are seen and unseen
Are an end but the start of all things that are left to do

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you

(That's it)

"De Selby (Part 1)"

At last
When all of the world is asleep
You take in the blackness of air
The likes of a darkness so deep
That God at the start couldn't bear
And sit unseen
With only the inner upheld
Your reflection can't offer a word
To the bliss of not knowing yourself
With all mirroring gone from the world

But still the mind
Rejecting this new empty space
Fills it with something or someone
No closer could I be to God
Or why he would do what he's done

Bhfuilis soranna sorcha

"De Selby (Part 2)"

What you're given
What you live in
Darling, it finds a way to live in you
And your heart, love
Has such darkness
I feel it in the corners of the room

(If I was any closer)
After the gloom
(I could only lose me)
I wanna lose me, I
(If I fade away, let me fade away)
I wanna fade away with you
(If I was any closer)
If I was any closer
(I could only lose me)
I could be lost
(If I fade away, let me fade away)
No more than I was or than I

Want to be when you fall on me like night
Every time
And I want to be so far from sight and mind
I wanna kill the lights

I wanna run against the world that's turning
I'd move so fast that I'd outpace the dawn
I wanna be gone
I wanna run so far, I'd beat the morning
Before the dawn has come, I'd block the Sun
If you want it done

Let all time slow
Let all light go
I don't need to know where we begin and end
I'd still know you
Not being shown you
I only need the working of my hands

(If I was any closer)
You understand
(I could only lose me)
I wanna lose me, I
(If I fade away, let me fade away)
I wanna fade away with you
(If I was any closer)
If I was any closer
(I could only lose me)
I could be lost
(If I fade away, let me fade away)
No more than I was or than I

Want to be when you fall on me like night
I wanna kill the lights

I wanna run against the world that's turning
I'd move so fast that I'd outpace the dawn
I wanna be gone
I wanna run so far, I'd beat the morning
Before the dawn has come, I'd block the Sun
If you want it done

(If I was any closer)
(I could only lose me)
(If I fade away, let me fade away)
(If I was any closer)
(I could only lose me)
(If I fade away, let me fade away)

I wanna run against the world that's turning
I'd move so fast that I'd outpace the dawn
I wanna be gone
I wanna run so far, I'd beat the morning
Before the dawn has come, I'd block the Sun
If you want it done

"First Time"

Remember once I told you about
How before I heard it from your mouth
My name would always hit my ears as such an awful sound
And the soul, if that's what you'd call it
Uneasy ally of the body, it felt nameless as a river
Undiscovered underground

And the first time that you kissed me
I drank dry the River Lethe
The Liffey would have been softer on my stomach all the same
But you spoke some quick new music
That went so far to soothe this soul
As it was and ever shall be, unearth without a name

Some part of me must have died
The first time that you called me, "Baby"
And some part of me came alive
The first time that you called me, "Baby"

These days I think I owe my life
To flowers that were left here by my mother
Ain't that like them, giftin' life to you again
This life lived mostly underground
Unknowin' either sight nor sound
'Til reachin' up for sunlight just to be ripped out by the stem

Sensing only now it's dyin'
Drying out, then drowning blindly
Bloomin' forth its every colour
In the moments it has left
To share the space with simple living things
Infinitely suffering, but fighting off like all creation
The absence of itself, anyway

Some part of me must have died
Each time that you called me, "Baby"
But some part of me stayed alive
Each time that you called, each time that you called

Come here
Ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la
Whatever keeps you around, it keeps you around
Ooh-la-la, come here, ooh-la-la
Whatever keeps you around, it keeps you around

The last time it was heard out loud
The perfect genius of our hands and mouths were shocked
To resignation as the arguing declined
When I was young I used to guess
Are there limits to any emptiness?
When was the last time?
Come here to me, when was the last time?

Some part of me must have died
The final time that you called me, "Baby"
But some part of me came alive
The final time you called me, "Baby"

"Francesca"

Do you think I'd give up
That this might've shook the love from me
Or that I was on the brink
How could you think darling I'd scare so easily?
Now that it's done
There's not one thing that I would change
My life was a storm
Since I was born
How could I fear any hurricane?

If someone asked me at the end

I'll tell them put me back in it
Darling, I would do it again
If I could hold you for a minute
Darling, I'd go through it again
I would still be surprised I could find you, darling
In any life
If I could hold you for a minute
Darling, I would do it again

For all that was said
Of where we'd end up at the end of it
When the heart would cease
Ours never knew peace
What good would it be on the far side of things?
But it was too soon
When that part of you was ripped away
A grip taking hold
Like a cancer that grows
Each piece of your body that it takes

Though I know my heart would break

I'll tell them put me back in it
Darling, I would do it again
If I could hold you for a minute
Darling, I'd go through it again
I would still be surprised I could find you, darling
In any life
If I could hold you for a minute
Darling, I would do it again

I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love
Like you and I
I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love
Like you and I
I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love
Like you and I

"I, Carrion (Icarian)"

If the wind turns
If I hit a squall
Allow the ground to find its brutal way to me

I feel lighter than I have in so much time
I've crossed the borderline of weightless
One deep breath out from the sky
I've reached a rarer height now
That I can confirm
All our weight is just a burden
Offered to us by the world
And though I burn
How could I fall?
When I am lifted by every word you say to me

If anything could fall at all
It's the world that falls away from me

You have me floating like a feather on the sea
While you're as heavy as the world
That you hold your hands beneath
Once I had wondered
What was holding up the ground
I can see that all along, love
It was you all the way down
Leave it now
I am sky-bound
If you need to, darling
Lean your weight to me

We'll float away
But if we fall, I only pray
Don't fall away from me

I do not have wings, love
I never will
Soaring over a world you are carrying
If these heights should bring my fall
Let me be your own
Icarian carrion

If the wind turns
If I hit a squall
Allow the ground to find its brutal way to me
If I should fall on that day
I only pray
Don't fall away from me

"Eat Your Young"

I'm starving, darling
Let me put my lips to something
Let me wrap my teeth around the world
Start carving, darling
I wanna smell the dinner cooking
I wanna feel the edges start to burn

Honey, I wanna race you to the table
If you hesitate, the getting is gone
I won't lie, if there's something to be gained
There's money to be made, whatever's still to come

Get some
Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw enough rope until the legs have swung
Seven new ways that you can eat your young
Come and get some
Skinning the children for a war drum
Putting food on the table selling bombs and guns
It's quicker and easier to eat your young

You can't buy this fineness
Let me see the heat get to it
Let me watch the dressing start to peel
It's a kindness, Highness
Crumbs enough for everyone
Old and young are welcome to the meal

Honey, I'm making sure the table's made
We can celebrate the good that we've done
I won't lie, if there's something still to take
There is ground to break, whatever's still to come

Get some
Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw enough rope until the legs have swung
Seven new ways that you can eat your young
Come and get some
Skinning the children for a war drum
Putting food on the table selling bombs and guns
It's quicker and easier to eat your young

"Damage Gets Done"
(feat. Brandi Carlile)

Without shame
Two outfits then to my name
You'd end up in one when you'd stay
We had nowhere to go
And every desire for going there

I heard once
It's the comforts that make us feel numb
We'd go out with no way to get home
And we'd sleep on somebody's floor
And wake up feeling like a millionaire

Wish I'd known it was just our turn (We just got by)
Being blamed for a world we had no power in (But we tried)
You and I had nothing to show (We didn't know)
But the best of the world in the palm of our hands (Anything, darling)

And, darling, I haven't felt it since then
I don't know how the feeling ended
But I know being reckless and young
Is not how the damage gets done

One time we would want for nothing (One time we had it all, love)
We knew what our love was worth (When we had nothing)
Now we're always missing something (I miss when)
I miss when we did not need much

Oh, if the car ran, the car was enough
If the sun shone on us, it's a plus
And the tank was always filled up
Only enough for our getting there

(And you flew away) That first car was like wings on an angel
Before the whole wide world got too thin
(From me then) I swear goodwill kept up the engine
You were steering my heart like a wheel in your hands (Turn back, darling)

And, darling, I haven't felt it since then
I don't know how the feeling ended
But I know being reckless and young
Is not how the damage gets done

All I needed was someone
When the whole wide world felt young
All I needed was someone
When the whole wide world felt young

"Who We Are"

You only feel it when it's lost
Getting through still has a cost
Quietly, it slips through your fingers love
Falling from you drop by drop

What I had left here
I just held it tight
So someone with your eyes
Might come in time
To hold me like water
Or Christ
Hold me like a knife

We're born at night
So much of our lives
Is just carving through the dark
To get so far
And the hardest part
Is who we are
It's who we are

You and I burned out our steam
Chasing someone else's dream
How can something be so much heavier
But so much less than what it seems
Darling we sacrificed
We gave our time to something undefined
This phantom life
It sharpens like an image
But it sharpens like a knife

We're born at night
So much of our lives
Is just carving through the dark
To get so far
And the hardest part
Is who we are
It's who we are

You only feel it when it's lost
Getting through still has its cost
Quietly, it slips through your fingers love
Falling from you drop by drop

"All Things End"

A two-tonne weight around my chest feels like
It just dropped a twenty-storey height
If there was anyone to ever get through this life
With their heart still intact, they didn't do it right

The last time I felt your weight on my chest, you said
"We didn't get it right, but, love, we did our best"
And we will again
Moving on in time and taking more from everything that ends

And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
Or slips right through our hands
And just knowing that everything will end
Should not change our plans
When we begin again
We begin again

I have never known a silence like the one fallen here
Never watched my future darken in a single tear
I know we want this to go easy by being somebody's fault
But we've gone long enough to know this isn't what we want
And that isn't always bad
When people say that something is forever
Either way, it ends

And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
Or slips right through our hands
And just knowing that everything will end
Should not change our plans
When we begin again
We begin again
We begin again, darling

And all things end
All that we intend is built of sand
Slips right through our hands
And just knowing that everything will end
Won't change our plans
When we begin again

And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
Or slips right through our hands
And just knowing that everything will end
Should not change our plans
When we begin again

"To Someone From A Warm Climate (Uiscefhuaraithe)"

A joy hard-learned in winter was the warming of the bed
You'd shake for minutes there and move your legs
Wrap the blanket over you and keep your head within
Let your breath heat the air until you'd feel it getting thin

'Uiscefhuaraithe'
The feel of coldness only water brings
There are some things that no-one teaches you, love
That come natural as a dream you didn't know that you were in
And darling, all my dreaming
Is only put to shame
And darling, all my dreaming
Has only been given a name
But it came easy, darling
As natural as another leg around you in the bed frame

In summer's heat, I learned to dread the coming of the night
The awful things we do to make the head go quiet
You'd press your body to the concrete when you were small
The rains of winter seemed to never leave the walls

'Uiscefhuaraithe'
The feel of coolness only water brings
There are some things that no-one teaches you, love
That God in his awful wisdom just programs in
But darling, all my dreaming
Is only put to shame
And darling, all my dreaming
Has only been given a name
But it happened easy
Natural as another leg around you in the bed

And I wish I could say
That the river of my arms have found the ocean
And I wish I could say the cold lake water of my heart
Christ, it's boiling over

But it happened easy, darling
Natural as another leg around you in the bed frame

"Butchered Tongue"

As a child it was the place names
Singing at me as the first thing

How the mouth must be employed
In every corner of itself
To say "Appalacicola"
Or "Hushpukena" like "Gweebara"
A promise softly sung of somewhere else
And as a young man
Blessed to pass so many road signs
And have my foreign ear made fresh again
On each unlikely sound
But feel at home
Hearing a music
That few still understand
A butchered tongue still
Still singing here above the ground

The ears were chopped
From young men
If the pitch-cap didn't kill them
They are buried
Without scalp
In the shattered bedrock of our home
You may never know your fortune
Until the distance has been shown between
What is lost forever
And what can still be known

So far from home
To have a stranger call you darling
And have your guarded heart
Be lifted like a child up by the hand
In some town that just means
'Home' to them
With no translator left to sound
A butchered tongue
Still singing here above the ground

"Anything But"

C'mere to me. I wish I was a may fly on the River Tay
I'd fit all my joys and my pleasures in one perfect day
I wish I was the sunlight just sitting on The Mississippi
I'd settle for a shopping trolley in The Liffey
In a shot I'd swap my body for a body of water
Worry the cliff side top as a wave crashing over
I'd lower the world in a flood
Or better yet I'd cause a drought
If I was a rip tide
I wouldn't take you out

I don't wanna be anything
But I would do anything just to run away
I don't wanna be anything like this at all
But I would do anything if you'd hear me say

Go look another way
Look another way

Look, I wanna be loud
So loud, I'm talking seismic
I wanna be soft as a single stone in a rain stick
I wanna be the thunder of a hundred thousand hooves moving quick
If I was a stampede
You wouldn't get a kick

I wanna be the shadow when my bright future's behind me
I wanna be the last thing anybody ever sees
I hear he touches your hand, and then you fly away together
If I had his job
You would live forever

I don't wanna be anything
But I would do anything just to run away
I don't wanna be anything like this at all
I would do anything if you'd hear me say

Go look another way
Look another way

I don't wanna be anything, be anything
But I would do anything (Go look another way)
I don't wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be, wanna be
Don't wanna be anything, anything

Go look another way
Look another way

"Abstract (Psychopomp)"

Sometimes it returns
Like rain that you slept through
That washed off the world
The streets looking brand new
I will not be great
But I'm grateful to get through
The feeling came late
I'm still glad I met you

The memory hurts
But does me no harm
Your hand in my pocket
To keep us both warm
The poor thing in the road
Its eye still glistening
The cold wet of your nose
The Earth from a distance

See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines

Sometimes there's a thought
Like you choose what you're doing
But it comes to nought
When I look back through it
I remember the view
Street lights in the dark blue
The moment I knew
I'd no choice but to love you

The speed that you moved
The screech of the cars
The creature still moving
That slowed in your arms
The fear in its eyes
Gone out in an instant
Your tear caught the light
The Earth from a distance

See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines

Darling, there's a part of me
I'm afraid will always be
Trapped within an abstract from a moment of my life
The weeds up through the concrete
The traffic picking up speed
All my love and terror
Balanced there between those eyes

See how it shines
See how it shines

"Unknown / Nth"

You know the distance never made a difference to me
I swam a lake of fire, I'd have walked across the floor of any sea
Ignored the vastness between all that can be seen
And all that we believe
So I thought you were like an angel to me

Funny how true colours shine in darkness and in secrecy
If there were scarlet flags
They washed out in the mind of me
Where a blinding light shone on you every night
And either side of my sleep
Where you were held frozen like an angel to me

It ain't the being alone
Sha-la-la
It ain't the empty home, baby
Sha-la-la
You know I'm good on my own
Sha-la-la
Sha-la-la, baby, you know it's more the being unknown
So much of the living, love, is the being unknown

You called me angel for the first time, my heart leapt from me
You smile now, I can see its pieces still stuck in your teeth
And what's left of it, I listen to it tick
Every tedious beat going unknown as any angel to me

Do you know, I could break beneath the weight
Of the goodness, love, I still carry for you?
That I'd walk so far just to take
The injury of finally knowing you

It ain't the being alone
Sha-la-la
It ain't the empty home, baby
Sha-la-la
You know I'm good on my own
Sha-la-la
Sha-la-la, baby
You know it's more the being unknown
And there are some people, love, who are better unknown

"First Light"

One bright morning changes all things
Soft and easy as your breathing
You wake
Your eyes open at first a thousand miles away
But turning shoot a silver bullet point-blank range
And I can scarce believe what I'm believing in
Could this be how every day begins?

The sky set to burst
The gold and the rust
The colour erupts
You filling my cup
The sun coming up

Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light

One bright morning goes so easy
Darkness always
Finds you either way
It creeps into the corners as the moment fades
A voice your body jumps to calling out your name
But after this I'm never gonna be the same
And I am never going back again

The sky set to burst
The gold and the rust
The colour erupts
You filling my cup
The sun coming up

Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light

"Better Love"
(from "The Legend Of Tarzan" soundtrack)

I once kneeled in shaking thrill
I chase the memory of it still, of every chill
Chided by that silence of a hush sublime
Blind to the purpose of the brute divine
But you were mine

Staring in the blackness at some distant star
The thrill of knowing how alone we are, unknown we are
To the wild and to the both of us
I confessed the longing I was dreaming of

Some better love, but there's no better love
Beckons above me and there's no better love
That ever has loved me, there's no better love
Darling, feel better love
Feel better love

I have never loved a darker blue
Than the darkness I have known in you, own from you
You, whose heart would sing of anarchy
You, who'd laugh at meaning's guarantee,
So beautifully

When our truth is burned from history
By those who figure justice in fond memory, witness me
Like fire weeping from a cedar tree
Know that my love would burn with me
We'll live eternally

Cause there's no better love
That beckons above me, there's no better love
That ever has loved me, there's no better love
So darling, feel better love
Cause there's no better love
That's laid beside me, there's no better love
That justifies me, there's no better love
So darling, darling, feel better love
Feel better love

Feel better love
Feel better love
Feel better love

Cause there's no better love
That beckons above me, there's no better love
That ever has loved me, there's no better love
So darling, feel better love
Cause there's no better love
That's laid beside me, there's no better love
That justifies me, there's no better love
So darling, darling, feel better love
Feel better love

"Blood"
(live version)

Tryin' hard to recognise
Some pure motive inside of me
A creature that would horrify
Any child that I used to be
Oh, give no faith to show
Started to smile, so I showed my teeth
No more than flesh and bone
Doin' so much just to watch someone bleed

But I love the very blood of you
It keeps its heat in spite of you
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always

Tryin' hard, I nearly find
Innocence in spite of me
Oh, creature that would terrify
Any child left inside of me
Oh, that's a cold insight
Nothin' above us and nothin' below
Ahh, but you might be right
If there is no heaven and there is no soul

I just love the very blood of you
It keeps its heat in spite of you
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always

Always...

Oh, I love the very blood of you
It keeps its heat in spite of you
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always
Oh, I love the very blood of you
Leaks and squeeks you black and blue
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always

"Blood Upon The Snow"
(from "God Of War: Ragnarok" soundtrack)

To all things housed in her silence
Nature offers a violence
The bear that keeps to his own line
The wolf that seeks always his own kind
The world that hardens as the harsher winter holds
The parent forced to eat its young before it grows

Every bird, gone unheard
Starving where the ground has froze
The winter sun rise, red on white
Like blood upon the snow
Like blood upon the snow

The ground walked here is a wonder
It ceases never to hunger
And all things nature's given
She takes all things back from the living

I've walked the earth and there are so few here that know
How dark the night
And just how cold the wind can blow
I've no more hunger now to see where the road will go
I've no more kept my warmth
Than blood upon the snow

Blood upon the snow
Blood upon the snow
Blood upon the snow

It's not my arms that will fail me
But this world takes more strength than it gave me
The trees deny themselves nothing that makes them grow
No rain fall, no sunshine
No blood upon the snow

Blood upon the snow
Blood upon the snow
Blood upon the snow

To all things housed in her silence
Nature offers a violence

"I Could Be Yours"

I could be soft and sweet
I could be hard and loud
I could be anything
You ever need somehow
Why don't you hear me sing
Out from the lost and found
I could be yours
I could be yours
I could be yours

Why don't you try on me
Why don't you take me home
I'll match the color scheme
Of your bedroom walls
Oh, take a dose of me
It doesn't hurt at all
I could be yours
I could be yours
I could be yours

Oh God, I'd benefit
From your sweet tenderness
Thank God it could've been
'Cause nothing comes from it
That'd be a helpful thought
If I could remember it, but
I could be yours
I could be yours
I could be yours

"Jackboot Jump (Live)"

At Standing Rock the Jackboot Jump
You'd swear was all the rage
Whether tearing up old treaties
Or just tearing up the place
It's always corporate infrastructure
Over the structure of your face

In Moscow the Jackboot show
Has so much in store
For any silly student
Who doesn't wanna learn the score
So the Moscow Jackboot Ballet
Finds some scared young dancing floor

In Hong Kong it won't be long
'Til they have to fall in line
For the long hand of Beijing
Stretching south a thousand miles
Where they rock the Jackboot Jump there
Like that shit's going out of style

All around the world
You'd think that things were looking rough
But the jackboot only jumps down
On people standing up
So you know good things are happening
When the jackboot needs to jump

"Swan Upon Leda"

A husband waits outside
A crying child pushes a child into the night
She was told he would come this time
Without leaving so much as a feather behind
To enact at last the perfect plan
One more sweet boy to be butchered by men

But the gateway to the world
Was still outside the reach of him
Would never belong to angels
Had never belonged to men
The swan upon Leda
Empire upon Jerusalem

A grandmother smuggling meds
Past where the god child-soldier Setanta stood dead
Our graceful turner of heads
Weaves through the checkpoints like a needle and thread
Someone's frightened boy waves her on
She offers a mother's smile and soon she's gone

The gateway to the world
The gun in a trembling hand
Where nature unmakes the boundary
The pillar of myth still stands
The swan upon Leda
Occupier upon ancient land

The gateway to the world
Was still outside the reach of him
Would never belong to angels
Had never belonged to men

"The Parting Glass"
(Live from the Late Late Show)

Of all the money that e'er I had
I've spent it in good company
And of all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas it was to none but me
For all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And of all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They'd wish me one more day to stay
But as it falls unto my lot
That I must go and you must not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all

"The Wages"

Although many contend
You may find hope ascend
To mark just how everything changes
Whether the temperature highs
Or the sea level rising
It's all going up but the wages

And murdered reporters
And talk of hard borders
Sky-bound as a heavenly choir
Or the stock price in Boeing
The screams of the dying
Or the skies over Yemen last night

It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time

Don't mention the rent
Or the money that's spent
Keeping the banks in good health
Or ridiculous claims
Or the level of blame
Pointed to anything else

And preachy musicians
And those stuck in prison
With scarcely enough for a blunt
Or the pressure of blood
That new hotel in the hood
With an oligarch's name on the front

It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up with the bump in the heating bills
Even though the city's on fire
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time

Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher

Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher
Higher and higher and higher

It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time
It's all going up with the bump in the heating bills
Even though the city's on fire
It's all going up but the wages
And maybe it's time

"Through Me (The Flood)"

Picture a man
Seen like a speck out from the shore
Swimming out beyond the breakers like he's done his life before
He feels the coming of a squall will drag him out a greater length
But knows his strength
And tries to gather it

And he swims on
Turning back to shore again
Above the outer atmosphere of a world he's never seen
And looking down to his new home, he feels the rising of a wave
And knows at once he will not weather it

Like that man
I looked down into the depths when I met you
I couldn't measure it

Any time I've struggled on
Against the course
Out on my own
Every time I'd burn through the world, I'd see
That the world, it burns through me
But when I'd let go
My struggling form
My willing soul
Every time I'd flow through the world, I'd see
That the world, it flows through me
That the world, it flows through me

Picture a grave
Picture six feet freshly dug
The sharp temporary walls at the long-term cliff edge of the world
Light and air find some new deepness there and usher down the sky
Where one stands by and tries make sense of it

But try measure loss
Measure the silence of a house
The unheard footsteps at the doorway
The unemployment of the mouth
The waking up, having forgotten
And remembering again the full extent of what forever is

With each grave
I think of loss
And I can only think of you
And I couldn't measure it

Any time I've struggled on
Against the course
Out on my own
Every time I'd burn through the world, I'd see
That the world, it burns through me
But when I'd let go
My struggling form
My willing soul
Every time I'd flow through the world, I'd see
That the world, it flows through me
That the world, it flows through me
