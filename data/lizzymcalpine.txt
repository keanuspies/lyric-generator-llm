"bite"

It's unforgivable
[?]
I am lately (?)
I feel like I'm goin crazy
I felt invincible
When you saved me
I thought maybe
We could be more than a phase
We weren't together very long
Maybe that's what went wrong
I have fallen too fast
And you got caught in the act
Why did you have to go and lie to me
Could've just confronted me
Didn't have to let me go that fast

I know you know
That I know that I was just a rebound
Not anything real
I shouldn't be waiting (waiting)
Or pacing (or pacing)
Or thinking that you've changed
For real

And I know that you're still in love with her
Even after all of the things that she did
You just can't help it
You ditched me
And acted like you didn't even care
I don't know how we got here
But my fear that [?]
Mmmm
I live my life in [?]
Apparently you wanted back in my life (?)
I'm turning all the tables now
You don't think I'm able to forget you
But honey I might
You think I'm innocent
Harmless
Just a little child
But baby
I fight

"her"

She was a diamond
In a sea of storms
Her brown eyes
Are finally shimmering on their own
She knew, she knew, she knew
That she would be okay

For a moment
Time stopped
For a moment
It was just her
And the things on that mountaintop
She knew, she knew, she knew
That everything was okay

Oooh
This girl
She was fragile
And so it seemed
She only showed the side of her
That people wanted to see
She wanted to see the world
But was trapped in a cocoon
So she hacked a rocket ship
Headed straight for the moon

"give way"

I know a boy
He looks like a sin
But he smells like whisky
His mouth tastes like gin
He's caring and compassionate
But doesn't ever show it
I wanna know what goes through his mind

I know that boy
He can sometimes be a handful
He loves a lot of things
And I would like to know about them, too
So let me in
And I'll show you
What makes me different from you
I'll show you everything
That makes you, you
Ooo
We'll reimagine
All the things we thought we knew
Just me and you

We'll fly (fly by)
Fly away (fly away)
From all the things that we carry
Things that we share
And wish that would give way
We'll fly (fly by)
Fly away (fly away)
Two lonely people
With nothing to lose (nothing to lose)
And everything to gain
Ohhh
Da da da da da da da da da
Won't you
Give me a smile
Da da da da da da da da da
Won't you
Stay with me for a while

"waiting"

I can't wait to take you around the world
With me
I can't wait for you to get back home
So we can pack up and leave
I don't know why this scares me so much
I've been through this before
Maybe I'm realizing that this is nothing like before
But something about this is different
Now I know for sure
It's crashing down on me
Like a wave hits the shore

I'm packing up my pieces
Letting it all fly with the wind
For you, for you
I'll feel
But so what
Who cares
If I'm just throwing my life away
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
And home will always be
Home will always be
Waiting for me
When I get back home
When I, When I, when I
Get back home
I can't wait for magical stardust in the sky
One of these days
I'll pack up and start a new life

Hey, you over there
Why don't you come over here
Tell me about your dreams
I'll tell you about my schemes
Are you afraid
Scared of wanderlust
Don't break the news
Let's just adjust

I'm packing up my pieces
Letting it all fly with the wind
For you, for you
I'll feel
But so what
Who cares
If I'm just throwing my life away
Il'll be with you
I'll be with you
And home will always be
Home will always be

Packing up my pieces
Letting it all fly with the wind
For you, for you
It's always for you
But so what
Who cares
If I've thrown my life away
I'll be with you
I'll be with you
And home will always be
Home will always be
Waiting

"gone"

How do I know
When it's time to let go
I keep living in a daydream
And I can't find my way home
Did I miss a sign
Was there something I needed to find
Lost and confused
I write my feelings on paper
In the form of a song
Like this will help me along
I don't know where we went wrong
Can't get out of bed
I am stuck in my own head
I need to write a new song

I don't know where you went
But it's somewhere I can't get to
Why do you insist on living like this
Why won't you let me find you
Help me
Let me remind you
What we had was innocent
But careful and strong
What we had was great
But now it's gone

Oo-oo-oo-oo
Yeah

You are replaceable
And boy I'm unbreakable
Can't shoot me down
I won't surrender now
In the form of a song
Like this will help me along
I don't know where we went wrong

Only trying to help tore apart whatever we felt
Now it's gone
I don't know where you went
But it's somewhere I can't get to
Why do you insist on living like this
Why won't you let me find you
Help me
Let me remind you
What we had was innocent
But careful and strong
What we had was great
But now it's gone
Oh, now it's gone

"Indigo"

Where the girls are the fairest the boys are the rarest
Ohhh

Love
Blue
Oceans move for you
Fire
Rain
Hits me all the same

Oh indigo
Indigo
You and I made indigo
Deep deep indigo
Indigo

Sand in my crotch, there's sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch, there's sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch, there's sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch, there's sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Sand in my crotch
Yeah!

"I Know A Boy"

I know a boy
He likes to laugh
His brain is mess
But I like it like that

I know a boy
He tastes like the moon
Hangs up the stars
That dance 'round my room

We paint by numbers
But color outside the lines
We don't do what we should
We beat to our own time

Baby
Love can be so damn magical
Hey we
Are already lovesick
And flower pickin'
Daisies and roses
We're doing fine
Baby
Our roses
Are intertwined

I know a boy
And he is mine
Mmm

"New"

I feel like running
So far away from here
I'm stuck in pudding
Can't move an inch my dear

Maybe in time
I could learn to love another
Maybe he'll be just like you

Maybe in time
I could grow to be some other
Person who can love like you
Ooh, ooh

I'm just existing
Not taking up too much space
It's probably this thing
Making my heart jump out of its place

I know in time
I will learn to love another
I hope he's just like you

I know in time
I will grow to be some other
Person who can love like you

I'm not happy
But I'm getting through the days
I feel lonely
But I don't let the darkness engulf me in flames

I am new
Because of you
I feel free
Because you helped me see

Sometimes I wonder
Sometimes I don't
Lightning and thunder
Threaten to sink my faltering boat

I hope you know
That I've never loved another
Quite the way that I loved you

I hope you know
That I'll never find another
Person who can love like you

I'm not happy
But I'm getting through the days
I feel lonely
But I don't let the darkness engulf me in flames

I am new
Because of you
I feel free
Because you helped me see

Oh, ooh

"Honeydew"

Wait for me when I go
Live in color but don't forget my aching soul
I can see the blue moon
Late at night, I wonder if you see it, too

I feel lost without you
Maybe you do, too
I feel like I'm no one
Maybe I'm like you
Faith and honeydew

I'm alone and you're not here (not here)
You can't run to me and comfort all my fears (all my fears)
Maybe that's a good thing though
Not dependent on someone else to help me grow

I feel lost without you
Maybe you do, too
I'm so much like you

I don't know how to get through this
I don't know what to do
Maybe if all these mountains drifted to you
Do you know if the sky is falling?
Do you know when it hits?
And all these mountains fall before their names hit your lips
Our love cannot grow when it's suffocated
Not right now, but we both know, time will mend the craters
I tell myself that I don't
Mind this space but behind this face I'm lost

I feel like I'm no one
Maybe I'm like you
Faith and honeydew

"Ocean Blue"

I'm speechless
No words I make have meaning
Right now they're
Lost within me deep within me you complete me please don't leave me now

You're beauty
Inside and out
Enchants me
You understand the way I work
I understand the way that you work too
We fit like glue

There's not a thing
I wouldn't do for you
You make me sing
You inspire the words of my youth
We are far apart but they still hold true

It's so easy
To lose myself in you
I could hide
Inside your eyes
Deep and misty ocean blue
I was fine until I spent a while
Let myself drift
I couldn't see that I was
Slowly losing independence
Oh now
I feel much more free
I can finally see how
Time is everything
Oh love alone is not enough to heal the pain

I find you
So interesting
Your brain works
In ways I've never seen before
It's so annoying yet so intriguing too
I need you

There's not a thing
I wouldn't do for you
You make me sing
You inspire the words of my youth
We are far apart but they still hold true

It's so easy
To lose myself in you
I could hide
Inside your eyes
Deep and misty ocean blue
I was fine until I spent a while
Let myself drift
I couldn't see that I was
Slowly losing independence
Oh now
I feel much more free
I can finally see how
Time is everything
Oh love alone is not enough to heal the pain

"Are U Okay?"

Am I real?
Do I feel
These things that I feel?
Do you feel them too?
I'm drowning in glue

Tears, they fall
Down my pink cheeks
They don't have homes
Landing wherever they fall
Are you okay?
Not at all

Leave
Watch as I fall
Watch as it all rains down in time
Leave
Watch me my love
Watch as the dove begins to fly

I fall in love
Every time I hear your name
Listless and strong
About what I used to claim
Don't call me back
But then maybe I want you to care
You can't look back
But then how will you know if he's there

It's like walking through sand
Trying to fall
Out of love
On command
Never quite reaching the end
I'm trying to pretend

Leave
Watch as I crawl
Watch as the sky turns purple-blue
Leave
Watch me begin
It's not a sin to still love you

I fall in love
Every time I hear your name
Listless and strong
About what I used to claim
Don't call me back
But then maybe I want you to care
You can't look back
But then have will you know if he's

There are so many things that remind me of you
I need to get out, leave for my sanity soon
There are so many things that remind me
I need to get out, leave for my sanity
There are so many things that remind me
I need to get out, leave for my sanity
There are too many things that remind me of you
I need to get out, leave for my sanity soon

"Daisy"

Oooh (Bum bum)
Oooh (Bum bum)
Oooooh

Once there was a girl
Who captivated the world
She drew them in with her voice like money
That girl she had it all
Could make the fairest fall
She drew me in with her lips as gold as honey

If she knew
I longed to touch her silken skin each night
And if she knew
I did this all for her
If she knew
I need her by my side to breathe alright
And if she knew

Daisy, Daisy, please don't go
Daisy, Daisy, keep me
Oh, let me heal you
Let me break you
And we'll do it again
I just crave you
Let me save you
From the man who is your hand
I don't wanna be alone
So tell me where did I go wrong
Help me see the green light in front of me

Mmmm
Ba dum bum
Hmmmmm

"Roses And Riots"

I could count the stars
Wait until the dawn
I could cry tears of honey
Sweet as the hummingbird's song
I could drift away
Walking paths I'd never thought to follow
I could meet someone new
Feed them love and make them swallow

You are mayhem and quiet
You are roses and riots

I don't know where to start without you
Even though I'm beginning to doubt you
You say everything that I need to hear
Ghost-like words that drift around the atmosphere
You linger even when you're supposed to be dead
You always did say things that you wanted unsaid
Loving an artist is hard when it's only in bed
'Cause I was always more beautiful inside your head

"Give Me A Minute"

Give me a minute
Just one will do
I'll say goodbye, to gossamer skies
The city will move out of frame
But it's still you who remains

Give me a minute
Kiss me again
I'll say goodbye, to cloudy blue skies
I trade all I got in my name
For you instead of this pain

Maybe it's time to forget you
Maybe it's time to throw dirt upon your name
Or place blame
But it's no one's fault
No, it's no one's fault
We're just late

I'll give you a minute
Let you have peace
I'll say farewell, to what I can't tell
I bet that you'll do just the same
And maybe I'm what remains

"Nothing / Sad N Stuff"

[Nothing]

I don't wanna leave
So tell me why I'm going
I don't wanna leave
But I'm gone
I don't wanna leave
But I'm already running
And if you ask what's wrong
"Nothing"

Oh, I'm so sorry
I am a fool
I'm so sorry
For what I'm about to do

Here's your shirt I stole
Take back what you gave me to hold
I can wear my own coat when it's cold
I don't need yours, mmm
'Cause I don't think I can do this anymore

I'm not sorry
That I loved you 'til I couldn't breathe
It was lovely
But I know that it's not what I need
It was good, but it's time for me to leave

[Sad N Stuff]

Something doesn't feel right
Maybe it's the time
Something doesn't feel like it used to
And nothing really rhymes
Maybe it's the changing of the seasons
Or maybe it's a sign
Hmmm, hmmm

Something doesn't sit well
Maybe it's the food
Something doesn't fit
Well, I think I always knew
That it could be the way I don't speak Spanish
Or it could be you
Hmmm, hmmm

He feels good to come home to
But not to stay
I'm afraid
That he feels good to hold on to
But it feels good to say
That I'd be okay
Without you, I'd feel the same

I'm alone, I'm alone, I'm alone all at once
And I don't know, I don't know how to get back what was
Is it something in the wind or the rain that makes me sad and stuff?
Or is it just... you?

He feels good to come home to
But not to stay

"Over-The-Ocean Call (Andrew)"

[Over-the-Ocean Call]

[?] the corner
No
Please, just-
No, hold on, I'm-hold on

Does this make sense to you?
'Cause it doesn't make sense to me
Does this have weight for you?
'Cause it doesn't have weight for me

And I think my mind is far away
Sort of strange, this is
But I think I'll call you anyway
Call collect, 'cause baby this is

An over-the-ocean call
And I thought I could make it short
But my brain's all out of sorts
I can't hide it
And I'm staring at my wall
And I thought that I wouldn't cry
But breaking your heart breaks mine
I can't hide it
An over-the-ocean call
Is how I told him
This isn't working anymore

I needed space from you
But this doesn't look like space to me, oh
And you hate the things I do
And sometimes you hate me

But I think my mind is far away
Sort of strange, this is
But I think I'll call you anyway
Call collect, 'cause baby this is

An over-the-ocean call
And I thought I could make it short
But my brain's all out of sorts
I can't hide it
I'm staring at my wall
And I thought that I wouldn't cry
But breaking your heart breaks mine
I can't hide it
An over-the-ocean call
Is how I told him
This isn't working anymore

I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine
I'll call from over the ocean
This time, this time, this time
I'll break your heart through the phone, I
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine
I'll call from over the ocean
This time, this time, this time
I'll break your heart through the phone, I
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine
I'll call from over the ocean
This time, this time, this time
I'll break your heart through the phone

With an over-the-ocean call
And I thought I could make it short
But my brain's all out of sorts
I'm staring at my wall
And I thought that I wouldn't cry
But breaking your heart breaks mine
An over-the-ocean call
Is how I told him
This isn't working anymore

[Andrew]

Let me count all the freckles
On your arms alone
Let me smooth out the wrinkles
In the nicest shirt you own
Oh to love you is sweet like a peach
I think your laugh is my cure
Oh to love you is summer in reach
Kiss me and tell me I'm yours

Andrew, I'm falling
Without a warning
Until the morning
Don't let me go
Don't let me go
Just kiss me slow, oh
I love you, you know

"I Knew"

I knew that you loved me
When you walked me to class in the dark
I knew that you loved me
When you ran to the store for a card
You couldn't find a pencil, you asked someone sweetly
You wrote out a note and you ran back to meet me
And gave it to me on the bridge
I said I would never forget this
And I never did

I knew that you loved me
When you walked me back home one night
I knew that you loved me
When I saw that my shoe was untied
You bent down to tie it in the middle of the street
There was snow everywhere, it was turning to sleet
But I knew when you looked up at me
This was where I was meant to be

So why?
Why did you have to go?
Why did you have to go so soon?
Why?
Why did you leave me there?
Why did you leave me without you?
Why did I think I knew?

I knew that you loved me
But you told me we just weren't right
And I knew that I loved you
When I couldn't fall asleep that night
I miss hearing all of your favorite songs
And I wish I could tell you, "turn it all off," one more time
And everyone laughs and then it is quiet

Why?
Why did you have to go?
Why did you have to go so soon?
And why?
Why did you leave me there?
Why did you leave me without you?
And why did I think I knew?

"Where Do I Go?"

I am good with directions
I can find my way just by looking at stars
I have not lost my senses
I can find my way through a room in the dark

But I don't know
How to figure out where to go
From here

I'm lost and confused
Where do I go without you?
Where do I go without you?

I'm the breeze on a fall day
And I don't stop to think, I don't catch my breath
I have memorized places and feelings
I know them all like the back of my hand

And I don't know
How to figure out where to go
From here

And now I'm alone on this island
I drink so I don't think of you, oh oh
And now I'm alone
I don't know if this was the right thing to do

Where do I go without you?

I wanna tell you I miss you
But that contradicts what I told you before
I wanna tell you I love you
But do I really know how I feel anymore?

And I don't know
How to figure out where to go
From here

I'm lost and confused
Where do I go without you?
Oh, where do I go without you?

"To The Mountains"

Oh, I'm headed to the mountains
I'll be back in a week or two
Don't you try to reach me 'cause I won't pick up for you
I've got some things I need to do

Hmmmm

Oh I'm headed to the mountains
Where the air is sweet and new
Don't you try to reach me 'cause I don't want to talk to you
I've got some thinking to do

I'm trying to let go
I think it could help being alone
And I'm trying not to let you make me cry
I've spilled too many tears
And I think I deserve to be alone

And don't you try to reach me while I pick myself up and go
I've got to do this on my own
I need to build myself a home

Ohhhhh

Oh, I'm headed to the mountains
The only place I feel at peace
And I knew you'd come after me so I threw away your keys
But I know you'd never go when I say leave
I'm headed to the mountains... don't wait up for me

"You, Love (Interlude)"

I'll go softly
So you don't hear a thing
I won't waste my time
Saying things that I don't mean

'Cause we're too young
And I don't want to fall just quite yet
It was you, love
But now I'm alone again

"Means Something"

I saw your name on a street sign
In the middle of nowhere
And that has to mean something

I know your zodiac sign
Me and Leos get along great
And that has to mean something

But for some reason
You're not here
And I refuse to believe
That means something

Oh oh

I felt the way that you hugged me
When I was broken inside
And that has to mean something

I felt the way that you kissed me
When we got too drunk that night
And that had to mean something (something, something)

But for some reason
You're not here
And I refuse to believe
That means something

Every time I think too much
It ends up crazy
I don't know how to not think about you
Every time I trust my gut
I think I'm crazy
'Cause I don't know how to put my trust in you

Do you think it means something
That I wrote another song about you?

"Same Boat"

If I had the chance
To see the Northern Lights
I would book the next flight
And I'd buy a jacket

If I had the chance
To see snow fall for the first time
I would stop and rewind
To re-find the magic

But if there was ever a chance to tell you
That I think about you every single day
I don't know if I could take that chance
Or take your hand and say

You are on my mind (Oh, oh)
When I miss the snow (Oh, oh)
You show up when I hear that song or
I finally start watching that TV show
I don't know why every time that I think of home
I can picture you standing in the cold
But I, I'm scared 'cause I don't know
If you and I are in the same boat

If I had the chance
If you asked out of the blue
How I really truly feel about you
I don't have a clue how that would go

Oh, if I had the chance
Would I really tell you?
Would I bare my soul and maybe end up crying in the bathroom?
Or would I ask you to kiss me slow?

'Cause you are on my mind
When I miss the snow
You show up when I hear that song or
I finally start watching that TV show, oh-woah
I don't why every time that I think of home
I can picture you standing in the cold
But I, I'm scared 'cause I don't know
If you and I are in the same boat

"Pancakes For Dinner"

Don't wanna be forward
Don't wanna cross a line
But if I were to crash in this plane tonight
I'd want you to know this

Don't wanna say too much
Intrude on your space
But if I were to crash and I never made it home
I'd want you to know this

Oh, and to tell you is too scary
So I'll just say something else
And I wish that you could hear me
When I talk to myself
But this plane might not land safely
So what the hell do I have to lose?
If I just tell you

I wanna eat pancakes for dinner
I wanna get stuck in your head
I wanna watch a TV show together
And when we're under the weather we can watch it in bed
I wanna go out on the weekends
I wanna dress up just to get undressed
I think that I should probably tell you this in case there is an accident
And I never see you again
So please save all your questions for the end
And maybe I'll be brave enough by then

Don't wanna say something wrong
Don't wanna be weird
But if you're still in love with her, I think that I'll leave it there
And I won't ever tell you this

Oh, 'cause to tell you is too scary
So I'll just say something else
Like how was fall semester
And what was that song about?
I'll try to hide the way I feel
But I'll just wanna shout
What do I have to lose right now?

I wanna eat pancakes for dinner
I wanna get stuck in your head
I wanna watch a TV show together
And when we're under the weather we can watch it in bed
I wanna go out on the weekends
I wanna dress up just to get undressed
I think that I should probably tell you this in case there is an accident
And I never see you again
So please save all your questions for the end
And maybe I'll be brave enough by then

Or maybe I won't ever say what's in my head
No, I won't have to say anything
You'll say it instead

"How Do I Tell You?"

I'm a little scared you'll leave
Even though you tell me you won't
I'm a little scared of being
Someone that you're scared to love
You don't talk the way he did
And you don't say the things he did
I'm not who I was back then but still

I'm a little scared to speak
'Cause I can't find the words to say
And I don't want to make this about me
I just can't hold it in today
But you don't play the games he did
And you don't make me feel like shit
And my mom likes you more than him
But still

How do I tell you that I've come to like the pain?
How do I tell you that I don't know what it means
To be happy with somebody?
Don't know anything 'bout that
Who the hell can write a love song without making it too sad?
That's all I've been
How do I tell you?
How do I tell you I got it from him?
Ooh, ooh, ooh

I'm a little prone to feel a little overwhelmed with it all
'Cause you are someone I want to know
And I hope you don't let me fall
You make sure I get home safe
And you always know what to say
I feel like I found my place
But still

How do I tell you that I've come to like the pain?
How do I tell you that I don't know what it means
To be happy with somebody?
Don't know anything 'bout that
Who the hell can write a love song without making it too sad?
That's all I've been
How do I tell you?
How do I tell you I got it from him?
How do I tell you I got it from him?

"Apple Pie"

Some days I'm lonely
And some days I'm not
Some days I am only
A little bit sad, not a lot

How do you
How do you make a home?
What to do?
'Cause I never stay too long

Every house looks the same in my dreams
Every house feels like home for a couple weeks
I've been runnin' 'round trying to find a
Place where I can breathe
But me oh my
I found you under an April sky
And you feel like
City life, apple pie baked just right
Home is wherever you are tonight

Some days feel empty
Some days feel whole
Someday we can be in the same city
Someday we'll be grown and I'll be
Fine with packing up
Cardboard boxes filled and sad farewells
And I'll be fine with that goodbye
As long as I don't say goodbye to you as well

'Cause every house looks the same in my dreams
Every house feels like home for a couple weeks
I've been runnin' 'round trying to find a
Place where I can breathe
But me oh my
I found you under an April sky
And you feel like
City life, apple pie baked just right
Home is wherever you are tonight

Let's rent a place
Two rooms and a window facing
Buildings and fire escapes
Might be no AC
A little bit cramped
But see if I'm with you, it's okay
(Mmmmm)

Me oh my
I found you under an April sky
And you feel like
City life, apple pie baked just right
Home is wherever you are tonight

"Headstones And Land Mines"

Headstones and landmines
Flowers and red wines
They buy you nice things
And they sing pretty songs
But it doesn't help

Oak trees and dirt piles
Funerals and mistrials
They say pretty words
And they hug from six feet
But it doesn't help
And nothing works but time
And it all hurts but it's fine

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mhmm, hmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mhmm, hmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, hmm

Chaos and carpet
A study in scarlet
The room doesn't talk
And the furniture nods as I pass

Heights marked in pencil
Kitchen utensils
The books don't say sorry
They don't crowd and touch
They're just observers collecting their dust
They know that nothing they say is enough
So they don't say a thing

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mhmm, hmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mhmm, hmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, hmm

"In Agreement"

I talk to my walls about you
Pretty sure they're tired of hearing it
I talk to my walls about you
Now all four know your name
I talk to my walls about you
And I think they agree the room doesn't feel the same
And there's only you to blame
Oh, oh

I talk to my friends about you
Pretty sure they're tired of hearing it
I say I met a guy, and he treats me real nice
Which is good for a change
I talk to my friends about you
And I think they agree my exes weren't always great
And I don't really buy into fate

But you tell me I'm pretty
And you don't ask for too much
'Cause you know and I know
That promises sometimes can hurt
When it's barely begun
And I don't want this to fall through
Collapsing is what I'm used to
But we're all in agreement
This is something I should hold onto
Mmm, mmm, mmm

I talk to my mom about you
She thinks you sound wonderful
I talk to my mom about you
And I tell her you are
I talk to my mom about you
And I think we agree I found what I was looking for
And now I know for sure

'Cause you tell me I'm pretty
And you don't ask for too much
'Cause you know and I know
That promises sometimes can hurt
When it's barely begun
And I don't want this to fall through
Collapsing is what I'm used to
But we're all in agreement
This is something I should hold onto

"Let Light Be Light"

My brain feels heavy like too much TV
It's weighing on me like a pound of concrete
I know he wants me and that makes me happy
So why do I feel so weird?
It's foggy in my head, like clouds in a storm
The wind's pickin' up, I'm boltin' my shit to the floor
But when I'm with him, my shit gets ignored
Is that why I feel so weird?

I'm alone almost every night
And I don't know if I'm processing right
But my therapist says to just let light be light
So I'm letting him stay around
I think that he's good for me
This boy that I've found

I don't like getting attached
It makes me feel like I've done something bad
'Cause I'm not dependent, and I know that
So why am I scared I'm reliving that part of my past?

'Cause I'm alone almost every night
And I don't know if I'm processing right
But my therapist says to just let light be light
So I'm letting him stay around
I think that he's good for me
This boy that I've found
Oh, I think that he's good for me
This boy that I've found

Is this what it's supposed to feel like?
Is this what it's supposed to feel like?
Is this what it's supposed to feel like?
Is this what it's supposed to feel like?

'Cause I'm alone almost every night
And I don't know if I'm processing right
But my therapist says to just let light be light
So I'm letting him stay around
I think that he's good for me
This boy that I've found

This boy that I've found, mmm

"...What Are We?"

Given the circumstances
I won't ask you to stay
Given the circumstances
I would get it if you walked away

But all my life, I've been looking for this
It seems fitting that things go to hell now that I've found it

I don't think we're wasting time, but if you do, I'm sorry
I can see a life with you, but if you can't, I'm sorry
If four months mean nothing
If none of it counts for something, then I'm sorry
Oh, if spending every night in your bed
Has no meaning, then what are we?
Just a sorry excuse for love?
Love

Lately, the world is ending
So I won't ask for too much
Lately, the world is ending
And I find that I pretend to be okay with too much

But all my life, I've been looking for this
Real funny that things go to hell now that I found it

I don't think we're wasting time, but if you do, I'm sorry
I can see a life with you, but if you can't, I'm sorry
If four months mean nothing
If none of it counts for something, then I'm sorry
Oh, if spending every night in your bed
Has no meaning, then what are we?
Just a sorry excuse for love?
Love
A sorry excuse for love

"I Don't Know You At All"

I don't know your phone number
I don't think I ever did
I don't know if you love coffee
Or if you could live without it

Feels like we've been through war together
Feels like you've been right here forever
But I don't even know you at all

I don't know your favorite place to eat
Or what argument makes you square up to fight
I don't know your favorite way to sleep
Or if it changes every night

Feels like we've been through war together
Feels like you've been right here forever
But I don't even know you at all
At all
At all

I know more about your friends than I know about you
I know that they've placed their bets on us, but since we're through
They can keep the money that they've wagered on our love
And maybe, someday soon, some of them will lose
But I don't know you, and I'm guessing that you don't know me
I don't know you, so how could we expect our love to come with ease?
I could say that we were kids, but that just isn't true
I could say we wanted to believe in something new
I could give a million reasons why but they won't do
'Cause in my heart, feels like I have always known you

I don't know your phone number
I don't think I ever will
I don't care if you love coffee
Or if just one sip makes you feel sort of ill

Feels like we've been through war together
Feels like you've been right here forever
And that's the thing that matters most of all

"Angelina"

Where did you go, Angelina?
Why did you take my foolish heart? Oh
I should've known, Angelina
I was never right for that part
I could've sworn, Angelina
We would get hitched and you'd be a bitch about
Getting us there on time
I'd thank the lord for Angelina
Oh, so I guess the wedding I'll never be getting
Will live in the back of my mind

I never loved you more than when you said goodbye
'Cause maybe I knew that love wasn't honest if you had to lie
I never loved you more than when you walked away
'Cause maybe I knew, Angelina, you'd never stay

Are you coming home, Angelina?
I think I'm done trying to hold on to you, mmm
I think you should know, Angelina
That I'd probably fall again if you wanted me to
And she said "I love you", so I said it back
But I wished she was you, mmm

"When The World Stopped Moving"

It's so hard to watch you be happy
It's so hard to know that I'm not
'Cause when the world stopped moving
Like it did last week
I just wanted you to hold me

It's so hard to not be in your life
'Cause you know I love your brother
And your mom like they were mine
And when the world stopped moving
Like it did last week
I just wanted you to hold me

And all your friends are mine
They know that we're nothing alike, mmm
So if they believe that we're meant to be
I'd like to think they're right
But when the world stopped moving
You weren't by my side
And that didn't feel right

It's so hard to remember last winter
But like the porcupine and cactus
They don't care 'cause they've both got prickers
And when the world stopped moving
I felt just like them 'cause see

Love is more than words
And I also hurt you
We've both done the worst, but
When the world stopped last week
I just wanted you to hold me

"Stupid"

Why am I pulled to you
And why does it never feel like
I'm finished talking
When we're finished talking?
Why am I pulled to you
And why does it never feel right
To not pick up when you're calling?

You know me so well
Even if you don't know my favorite type of cereal
You know me so well
Even though we're both different people now

It's stupid, it's so stupid to miss you like this
I feel stupid, so stupid to miss you like this
'Cause I told you to go and you went
Oh, what did I expect?
So it's stupid, it's stupid, I know that it's stupid
To love you
But I can't help it

Mmm, I can't help it
I can't help it

How did we get here?
It makes no sense, but it feels like
A sign from God
That I keep ignoring
How did we get to this place we're in?
It makes no sense, but it feels right
And maybe that's God
I probably shouldn't ignore him

You know me so well
Even if you don't know my favorite type of cereal
You know me so well
Even if you don't know I don't believe in God anyhow

But it's stupid, it's so stupid to miss you like this
I feel stupid, so stupid to miss you like this
'Cause I told you to go and you went
Oh, what did I expect?
So it's stupid, it's stupid, I know that it's stupid
To love you
But I can't help it

"In What World"

Pack up your things
Here's a bus ticket home
For your troubles
I know it's not ideal
I'll walk you down
And my mom's on the porch
She wants to say goodbye
I know it's not ideal

But in what world do these things go the way we want them to?
And I know I didn't cry
But I don't think I loved you
And in what world do we exist and not separate but us two?
'Cause I know I didn't cry
And that said something to you
If that world exists, I'd believe
That love might have some chance of being true

We have moved on
And it's clear we weren't meant to be lovers
It's obvious sometimes, oh
I know some things now
But it's clear that I don't have a clue
It's obvious sometimes

But in what world do these things go the way we want them to?
At nights, sometimes, I cry
But these tears are not for you
'Cause in what world do we exist and not separate but us two?
An alternate dimension
Where I love you too
If that world exists, I'd believe
That love might have some chance of being true

"doomsday"

Pull the plug in September
I don't want to die in June
I'd like to start planning my funeral
I've got work to do

Pull the plug, make it painless
I don't want a violent end
Don't say that you'll always love me
'Cause you know I'd bleed myself dry for you over and over again

Doomsday is close at hand
I'll book the marching band
To play as you speak
I'll feel like throwing up
You'll sit and stare like
A goddamn machine

I'd like to plan out my part in this
But you're such a narcissist
You'll probably do it next week
I don't get a choice in the matter
Why would I? It's only the death of me
Only the death of me

Pull the plug but be careful
I don't wanna die too soon
I think there's good in you somewhere
I'll hang on 'til the chaos is through

Doomsday is close at hand
I'll book the marching band
To play as you speak
I'll feel like throwing up
You'll sit and stare like
A goddamn machine

I'd like to plan out my part in this
But you're such a narcissist
You'll probably do it next week
I don't get a choice in the matter
Why would I? It's only

The death of me was so quiet
No friends and family allowed
Only my murderer, you
And the priest who told you to go to hell
And the funny thing is I would've married you
If you'd have stuck around
I feel more free than I have in years
Six feet in the ground

Doomsday is close at hand
I booked the marching band
To play as you speak
I feel like throwing up
You sit and stare like
A goddamn machine

I'd have liked to plan out my part in this
But you're such a narcissist
That you did it on Halloween
I had no choice in the matter
Why would I? It's only the death of me

"an ego thing"

Guns drawn, slow down
It's a battle over something stupid
They're all the rage right now
You don't know the truth
It's a battle that I think I'm winning
Something makes me think you think that too

I was trying to be honest
You don't make that easy to do

It's not that important
It's none of your concern
But you got angry
And said some angry words
It's not that I hate you
I hate that it hurt
There's nothing else to it
I can't do anything more, mm

Sharp knife, loaded gun
There are two ways we can do this
I know which would be more fun
I won't go first, won't apologize
Pretty sure that it's an ego thing
But I can't stand a compromise

I was trying to be honest
But now I think I should've just lied

It's not that important
It's none of your concern
But you got angry
And said some angry words
It's not that I hate you
I hate that it hurt
There's nothing else to it
I can't do anything more, mm

Ooh-oh, I was trying to be honest
If this is what I get, I won't be honest anymore
Oh, if this is what I get
I swear I won't be honest anymore

"erase me"
(feat. Jacob Collier)

Why am I awake?
Nails on the floor
And soot on my tongue
I don't know his name
But I still taste the rum

Nothing there but skin
Skeletons crawl on the ceiling
They know
That him and his aftershave hit like a drug
(Drug)
(Drug)

Don't answer me
I'm calling just to hear you scream
And you're fading
But he feels like you in between
I've said too much
In and out of wanting us
Now you're fading
And I wonder who will erase me
Who will erase me?

Race you to the end
My innocence waits like it desperately knows
That I'll crash if I don't let you go

Don't answer me
I'm calling just to hear you scream
And you're fading
But he feels like you in between
I've said too much
In and out of wanting us
Now you're fading
And I wonder who will erase me

Erase me
Erase me
And I wonder who will erase me

Don't answer me
I'm calling just to hear you scream
And you're fading
But he feels like you in between
I've said too much
In and out of wanting us
Now you're fading
And I wonder who will erase

Don't answer me
I'm calling just to hear you scream
And you're fading
But he feels like you in between
I've said too much
In and out of wanting us
Now you're fading
And I wonder who will erase me
Oh who will erase me?

"called you again"

I called you again
I don't know why I keep on
Thinking that we're friends
'Cause we don't really talk anymore
And I'm sorry for that
Honestly I never really loved you that bad

And I could be the end of it
But I never know when to stop talking
So I make my bed and sleep in it alone
'Cause I never know when we're done talking
If I don't love you, then why

Did I call you again?
I think that I was lonely
And I missed having friends
Now we don't really talk anymore
And it's good for us both
'Cause I know you love me the most

And I should be the end of it
But I never know when to stop talking
So I make my bed and sleep in it alone
'Cause I never know when we're done talking
And I should be the end of it
But I never know when to stop talking (When to stop talking)
So I make my bed and sleep in it alone
'Cause I never know when we're done talking
You're better off on your own

But you called me again
I don't know why it never seems to end
Now we don't really talk anymore
And it makes sense
'Cause all I do is hurt you
All I do is hurt you
All I do is cause you pain

'Cause I called you again

"all my ghosts"

(What the fuck?)

You got a Slurpee for free
I caught you lookin' at me in the 7-Eleven
Under fluorescent lights

We walked in comfy silence
Footsteps down familiar sidewalk
Knowing that we were here in our dreams last night

All my ghosts are with me
I know you feel them too
Ridin' shotgun next to your free Slurpee
They know all of my habits, but they don't know about you
I hope that's true
Mmm
Mmm, hmm

We made sangria and failed
I spilled mac and cheese on my pants
And thought about kissing you underneath kitchen lights

Oh, all my ghosts are with me
I know you feel them too
Oh, did you stand there while we were takin' shots of Brandy?
They know all of my habits, but they don't know about you
I hope that's true

I can see it now
The wedding of the year
I can see it now
He stands up there and wipes his tears
I can see it now
And all my ghosts disappear
I can see it crystal clear

You got a Slurpee for free
I caught you lookin' at me in the 7-Eleven
Under fluorescent lights

And all my ghosts were with me
I know you felt them too
Watchin' as I started to get dizzy
'Cause I hate all of my habits
But I happen to love you
I hope that's true

(Fuck you)
Hahahaha
(Fuck you)
Hahahaha

"reckless driving"
(feat. Ben Kessler)

I didn't mean to kiss you
I mean I did, but I didn't think it'd go this far
I didn't mean to kiss you
Now you can't focus on the road when I'm in your car

Now we're going one hundred, your hands aren't on the wheel
'Cause you're just staring at me like you're not convinced that I am real
And now we're at one-eighty and I can finally see
But then it's over in a second, crashed the car into the tree
Yeah, I can see it all happen, you'd rather die than take your eyes off me

I don't love you like that, I'm a careful driver
And I tell you all the time to keep your eyes on the road
But you love me like that, you're a reckless driver
And one day it will kill us if I don't let go

I don't know how to tell you
That I feel safe when you sit shotgun
Never felt this way with no one
And I lie when I tell ya
I know exactly where we're going
I get lost just for this moment

And now we're at one hundred, my hands aren't on the wheel
And I don't wanna lose this moment, want you to know just how I feel
And now we're at one eighty and I can finally see
But then it's over in a second, crashed the car into the tree
I don't know how it happened, guess I'd die to keep your eyes on me

'Cause I love you like that, I'm a reckless driver
You tell me all the time to keep my eyes on the road
Do you love me like that? If I keep on driving
Would you hold me when we crash or would you let me go?

Don't wanna scrape you off the pavement
I can't be your savior
I don't wanna be here when you lose control
Don't wanna watch it as it happens
See the crowd's reaction
I don't wanna be here when you kill us both

'Cause I don't love you like that ('cause I love you like that)
I'm a careful driver (I'm a reckless driver)
And I tell you all the time (you tell me all the time)
To keep your eyes on the road (to keep my eyes)
But you love me like that (do you love me like that?)
You're a reckless driver (if I keep on driving)
And one day it'll kill us (would you hold me when we crash?)
If I don't let go

'Cause I don't love you like that ('cause I love you like that)
I'm a careful driver (I'm a reckless driver)
And I tell you all the time (you tell me all the time)
To keep your eyes on the road (to keep my eyes)
But you love me like that (do you love me like that?)
You're a reckless driver (I'm a reckless driver)
And one day it'll kill us if I

"weird"
(feat. Laura Elliott)

I've been having strange dreams
Seeing ghosts and breaking things
Room's on fire as I sit and watch it melt around me
I've been hosting screenings
Of slightly altered movie scenes
Seems familiar 'til I realize that they look just like me

Where am I? I can't find the door
How long have you been here for?
Where the houses all can talk
And I don't mind the creaky floors

And now we're in a basement
I feel wasted and I'm sure
That you'll kiss me anyway
That'll be just the thing to wake me

Maybe I'm weird or maybe I'm off the wall
But maybe it's weirder not to have dreamed at all

I can walk through walls now
Quietly I roam the halls
Suddenly I'm ten feet tall and I can touch the ceiling
I think I scared you off now
I'm regretting getting close hoping
It was just a ghost that sorta looked just like you

Where am I? I can't find the door
How long have I been here for?
Where the houses all can talk
And I don't mind the creaky floors

And now I'm in a maze
Down in this basement and I'm sure
That you'll miss me anyway
That'll be just the thing to wake me

Maybe I'm weird or maybe I'm off the wall
But maybe it's weirder not to have dreamed at all
Maybe I'm weird or maybe I'm off the wall
But maybe it's weirder not to have dreamed at all

"ceilings"

Ceilings, plaster
Can't you just make it move faster?
Lovely to be sitting here with you
You're kinda cute but it's raining harder
My shoes are now full of water
Lovely to be rained on with you
It's kinda cute but it's so short

Then you're driving me home
And I don't wanna leave
But I have to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before
Before

Bed sheets, no clothes
Touch me like nobody else does
Lovely to just lay here with you
You're kinda cute and I would say all of this
But I don't wanna ruin the moment
Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos

But it's over
Then you're driving me home
And it kinda comes out as I get up to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before

But it's not real
And you don't exist
And I can't recall the last time I was kissed
It hits me in the car
And it feels like the end of a movie I've seen before
Before

"what a shame"

I don't wanna take my mind off you
Please, take me home and kiss me slow
And do anything you want to
Run your hand through my hair
It's okay to be rough
I'm a little bit tougher
Than all of your other girlfriends

But you're not allowed
She's got you under lock and chain
Too late to let her down
So you're not allowed
What a shame it would be if you left her now
Now

I don't wanna take my mind off you
Please, make me laugh and kiss me back
And do everything you want to
Push me up against the wall
It's okay to be rough
I can handle this stuff
Only if you're comfortable

But you're not allowed
She's got you under lock and chain
Too late to let her down
So you're not allowed
What a shame it would be if you left her now

Now
Now
Now
Now

"firearm"

I get high out the window
And I don't tell my mom
I mix you with my vodka
And it turns me on

There's a hole in my heart and I can't find the bullet
But you sleep with the firearm
I should've pulled it on you
What a shame, I can see it all
Now that we're through

I get drunk with my friends
Your name never comes up
I tell strangers online
That we broke up

There's a hole in my heart and I hate that it's there
'Cause I liked to act like I really don't care
But I do
What a shame that I put up with you

What a joke, was it all just an act?
I hate that it took me so long to react
You had me convinced that you loved me
What a fucked up reality show
Was it fame or the lack thereof?
I just don't know
You had me convinced that you loved me, oh

I'm not sure you realize
The pain that you caused
I don't feel like talking
But everyone else does

There's a hole in my heart and I can't find the bullet
But you sleep with the firearm
I should've pulled it on you
Now I don't have the energy to

"hate to be lame"
(feat. FINNEAS)

It's always on the tip of my tongue
I read an article on the internet
Told me that that's how you know you're falling in love
Don't really trust what's on the internet
But maybe just this once

Hate to admit but it might be true
Hate to admit but I think you knew
Hate to be lame but I might love you

It's always on the tip of my tongue
But I stop myself from saying it
Tell myself it's not the right time or something dumb
But then you kiss me like you do
And we're right back where we startÐµd from

Hate to admit but it might be true
Hate to admit but I think you knew
Hate to be lame but I might love you

Do I love him? Do I need him?
Do I want him? Do I care enough to say
That I love him, that I need him?
'Cause I don't but I wanna feel okay
If I love him, if I need him
Maybe that will make him stay
If I lie, will I still feel this way?

It's always in the back of my mind
Maybe my mistakes are the reason
That I made it back to you in time
If I could rewind
Would there be some butterfly effect?
What if we never met?
What if the stars never aligned?

Hate to admit but it might be true
Hate to admit but I think you knew
Hate to be lame but I might love you

"nobody likes a secret"

I hold my anger in my stomach
And I'm starting to have side effects
From hating you this much
No explanation, just a quote in a magazine
Where you said you only dated me for fun
And I'm paraphrasing now
But the gist of it was how you never loved me
Only in it for the sex
And I really don't get how
You can say that and be proud of it
We both know you were in deeper than that

Nobody likes a secret
And I was always yours
It's almost been a year
And even so
I still don't know what for

"chemtrails"

I see chemtrails in the sky, but I don't see the plane
What the hell is my problem with taking the blame?
'Cause I play with my food and then someone else takes it away
It's so hard to believe, but I'm trying to change

I see lines in the sand, but I don't see who made them
I still listen to that band that you showed me last April
I still play with my food, I'm a child at the grown-up's table
It's so hard to believe, but right now, I feel stable

I moved away and I grew a few inches
What a shame, I had a chance and I missed it
And there are some days when I hear that song
And I hate to admit it
But I miss it, I do
Oh, I miss it, I miss you

Oh, I miss it, I miss it, I miss you
Oh, oh
Oh, I miss it, I miss it, I miss you

I see chemtrails in the sky, but I don't see the plane
I know that I feel it, but I don't know the name
I play with my food and then I throw it away
So hard to believe I have to grow up this way

I moved out and I made some new friends
Sometimes when I shout, it feels like no one hears it
And there are some days when I think that, somewhere, you're watching
As I grow up without you
I miss it, I miss you
(Here is Elizabeth eating a big snack after being in the shower for fifteen minutes)
I miss it, I miss you (She's famished, you can tell)
(Say goodnight)
(Goodnight)

"orange show speedway"

Every guy at this festival has you in their eyes
I never think about it too much, but I'm thinking tonight
And it's really annoying that I'm triggered like this
'Cause your name isn't spoken, but I'm speaking it
And I don't know why it happened, but it happened like this

My best friends are with me and I feel okay
The last time I was here, I was eighteen
My mind is racing and I feel so strange
Last time I was here, you were with me

I fell in love at the Orange Show Speedway
It didn't look like this three years ago
I had it all at the Orange Show Speedway
Or someplace like that, it all looks the same
Everything changes, what a shame

I'm in the middle of the crowd and it's like no time's passed
I'm half-expecting you to be there when I turn to my left
We were stupid and young and I was so in love
We were just friends riding on the line between acceptable
And angering your girlfriend

My best friends are with me and I feel okay
The last time I was here, I was eighteen
My mind is racing and I feel so strange
Last time I was here, you were with me

I fell in love at the Orange Show Speedway
It didn't look like this three years ago
I had it all at the Orange Show Speedway
Or someplace like that, it all looks the same
Everything changes, what a shame

Uh, yep, ooh, fireworks
This is the best voice memo diary to date I think (This is amazing)
Just wanted to update myself
No one else listens to these but myself
(Hey), okay (You got the fireworks if you put that in a song)

I fell in love at the Orange Show Speedway
But I've never been here in my life
I think it all kinda feels like an Orange Show Speedway
When you're racing head-first towards something that'll kill you in five seconds flat
When I'm racing head-first towards everything that I want back

"30 Days"

It's been 30 days since I last saw you
30 days since we had nothing to fear
It's been too long now
I'm scared that I'm forgetting how you feel
30 days is way too real

It's been 4 weeks since I last saw you
4 weeks since we made plans to go north
It's been too long now
I'm scared that I'm forgetting you
I feel all out of sorts
4 weeks and I'm not yours

I've been reading books
I've started puzzles
I've been listening to all the greats
I've been trying new foods
I've been buying new shoes
But I can't seem to forget that it's been 30 days

It's been a month since I last saw you
No matter how you say it, it still means the same
It's been too long now
I think that I've forgotten how long it takes
For me to fall, I'm afraid
This time it wasn't long at all
And why it wasn't, I can't say
In fact it just took
30 days

"7pm"

It is 7 pm and I'm sitting all alone
No one's on my phone tonight
My boyfriend's in class
And my friends are back at home
And the internet is slow
So I can't watch my show tonight
Tonight

I'm losing my mind
I'm reading the news for the hell of it
I'm wondering if she's on your mind
Losing track of time
I'm learning to cook for the hell of it
And I'm wondering if she's by your side
Tonight (tonight)

I don't usually do this
But baby tell me that you love me and prove it
I'm just so far away it's easy to lose it
So tell me you're mine, oh
I'm so stuck and I need you to pull me back out (out, out)
Say you love me and maybe I'll stop having doubts (doubts, doubts)

It's 11 pm and I'm hanging up my phone
'Cause I've reached your dial tone again
Something tells me I'll go crazy
If you keep playing these games with me
So maybe I'll call you again, oh
And it don't make sense (it don't make no sense)

I'm losing my mind
I've smoked too much tryna deal with it
And I'm wondering if he's on your mind
Losing track of time
I'm takin' drugs on the couch just to deal with it
And I'm wondering if he's by your side tonight (tonight)

I don't usually do this
But baby tell me that you love me and prove it
I'm just so far away it's easy to lose it
So tell me you're mine, oh
I'm so stuck and I need you to pull me back out
Say you love me and maybe I'll stop having doubts

"And If"

Hey, I barely know you
But is it cool if I say hello?
Hey, I want to know you
Is that okay? Are you comfortable?

And if I fall
I blame the whiskey, I blame my mind
And if your lips happen to kiss me
I will be fine, fine, fine
Pour me another glass of wine

Hey, you barely know me
But is it cool if I talk for hours?
Hey, you could show me
What it is that's in that head of yours

And if I fall
I blame the moonlight, I blame your smile
And if I fall, I know that soon I'll be alright
Pour me another glass of wine

And if I cry
You won't mind

Who knows where?
Who knows where love goes when it dies?
How can a new love, tangled in you love, arise?
Who can say?
Who can say how we fell for each other?
Every day I notice your gray eyes and I am pulled into another dream, another wish
A place in my mind where you and I can exist
I dream about it all the time
I see you and I wish you were mine

"b"

I don't know who you are anymore
I can't keep fighting this unwinnable war
I'm tired and hopeless, but I'd do it
A million times more

I don't know if I'm right anymore
You are the one thing I constantly look for
In the crowd, I'm broken, but I'll find you
So don't close the door

I have loved you
Since the first day we met
I will always love you
I'm gonna tell you, but not quite yet

Cause I know you're broken
And I'm sorry for that

"Bang"

What is this feeling I can't control?
Am I dying and I don't know?
Is this the end or
Am I just cold?
My heart is frozen, he chilled me to the bone

Now I, I am the one who kills
Don't think I can? I will
A lion and its prey
I'm waiting for the time to pounce, okay
Cover it up with paint
Smile and play the saint
I'm coming for your throat
Point and aim and

Watch it go down in flames
I'm just a bit insane
If this is what love is, I want all of it
Subscribe me to the pain
Who says that playing nice
Is always the best advice?
Sometimes the only cure for the lonely pays the price

Oh no
I've lost my feet again
In this dirty, dirty world, I slip again
Who am I?
Do I cry for them?
Are we all just walking sinners?
Do we all just get condemned?

Now I, I am the one who kills
Don't think I can, I will
Take my hand
And we'll sit in the sand

And watch it go down in flames
I'm just a bit insane
If this is what love is
I want none of it, take away the pain
Who says that playing nice
Is always the worst advice?
Sometimes the only cure for the lonely pays the price

Oh no

"bliss"

When I cry, you cry
Is this real life?
I wanna know
Take me down to the coast
It's a new feeling
Not thinking, just feeling
I wanna know
Is this feeling revealing my soul?

Sunburn on my nose
Sun in the sky
Your hand on my thigh
You pick up a rose
From the path down to the beach
You hold it out and say "You're beautiful"
Why'd you do that to me?

This is bliss
When you kiss me
I am so oblivious to what's out there
Don't you worry if I start to stare
Oh, 'cause nothing's wrong
This is how it should have felt all along
Now I feel truly happy
I deserve to be happy

When it rains, I smile
Do you wanna stay a while with me?
Am I falling? Maybe, but it's TBD
Honestly, I love being alive right now
I hate saying goodbye but I love how it feels to let go
I know that it'll help me to grow

Oh, oh, this is bliss
When you kiss me
I am so oblivious to what's out there
Don't you worry if I start to stare
Oh, cause nothing's wrong
This is how it should have felt all along
Now I feel truly happy
I deserve to be happy

"Bored"

I walk away from you all of the time
We sleep in different beds every night
You say you love me, in reality, we fight 'til I lose my mind
I try to keep up with all I do wrong
You hate all of my favourite songs
I don't think I could tell you anything
It's gone on for way too long

I think it's pretty obvious, but you're pretty oblivious
So I'll be the one to break the bad news

I'm bored
Of saying the same things I've already said
So bored
Of talking to walls over and over again
Hope it doesn't seem like I'll put up with this forever
Just 'cause you like me
I don't hate the way I'm yours, I'm just bored

You walk away from me
All of the time
I dream about different guys
I say "I love you"
In reality I'm tellin' a lie

I think it's pretty obvious, but you're pretty oblivious
So I'll be the one to break the bad news

I'm bored
Of saying the same things I've already said (already said)
So bored
Of talking to walls over and over again (over again)
Hope it doesn't seem like I'll put up with this forever
Just 'cause you like me
I don't hate the way I'm yours, I'm just bored

I'm so bored
I'm so bored
I'm so bored

I think it's pretty obvious, but you're pretty oblivious
So I'll be the one to break the bad news

I'm bored
Of saying the same things I've already said
So bored
Of talking to walls over and over again
Hope it doesn't seem like I'll put up with this forever
Just 'cause you like me

I don't hate the way I'm yours
I don't hate the way I'm yours
I don't hate the way I'm yours
I'm just bored

"Ceilings (Demo)"

Ceilings, plaster
Can't you just make it move faster?
Lovely to be sitting here with you
You're kinda cute but it's raining harder
My shoes are now full of water
Lovely to be rained on with you
It's kinda cute but it's so short

Then you're driving me home
And I don't wanna leave
But I have to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before
Before

If I ever decide to show you this
Like when we end up getting married in like 10 years
And we're about to have kids or something, I don't know
That's far-fetched but
If you ever listen to this, you're great and thank you for being you
The end

Bed sheets, no clothes
Touch me like nobody else does
Lovely to just lay here with you
You're kinda cute and I would say all of this
But I don't wanna ruin the moment
Lovely to sit between comfort and chaos
(I don't even know what I'm saying anymore, it's 1: 30 in the morning)

But it's over
Then you're driving me home
And it kinda comes out as I get up to go
You kiss me in your car
And it feels like the start of a movie I've seen before

But it's not real (Not real)
And you don't exist
And I can't recall the last time I was kissed
It hits me (hits me) in the car
And it feels like the end of a movie I've seen before
Before

"Clementine (Demo)"

I'm watching everything go sideways
And I can't do a thing to make it stop
I won't remember this tomorrow
But I'll be sad when I wake up

I wish we were back in your apartment
I want you to sing me to sleep
I'll forget my wallet so I'll have to come back
And you won't forget me

Thought it was only fair
But I swear I didn't think it through this far
You chose this first
So I didn't think it'd hit me quite this hard
I don't want to see this part

I'm watching everything go sideways
Feels like someone's messing with my head
I'm not prepared to never know you again
I'm sorry, can we stop this instead?

Thought it was only fair
But I swear I didn't think it through this far
You chose this first
So I didn't think it'd hit me quite this hard
I don't want to see this part

When this is over
I'll never know that
I ever missed you at all
I'll be a stranger and
You will be kissing somebody
That I don't know
I'll take the train to the beach
And I'll sit on the sand
And I'll never know
I had a life before this
I don't want this

Thought it was only fair
But I swear I didn't think it through this far
You chose this first
So I didn't think it'd hit me quite this hard
I don't want to see this part

"Devil's Hold"

Hear the beat knock
As the heart stops
See the beast in the clean top
Making jaws drop
To the bottom of the barrels where we drink
Turn the water into wine
To get my finest couple hours for the night
The devil's music is a light
Intoxicated by the room
Boom banging, out the roof
Red the colour of the moon
Jerusalem could never bloom
In such a presence that consumes
Feeble minds, is only destined to submit
And so we lose
World of fools
Still I'm
Looking for quick thrills, in my head there's something missing
I'm in need of repentance, Mama thinks I'm not a christian
Really, I wrestle religion
Holy spirit guide my soul and keep me distanced
Need to get out of his hold, I see him grinning
Someone save me

I like the pain
And I like you
But the devil's got a hold on me too
I'd like to think
That I love you
But the devil doesn't play with fools

All puppets to the darkness, woah
Making a deal for the heartless souls
All good, all well
You should fold
Make it hard for me to break these walls
All puppets to the darkness, woah
Making a deal for the heartless souls
All good, all well
You should fold
Make it hard for me to break these walls

Eyes meet
Go toe to toe, sell your soul
For a fix of meaningless needs
A breeze
In the crevices of the dome piece
Alone these
Are the streets of temptation
We all face it
Forget the grace, back to the race
All we want is that first place medal
We do what it takes
Push others out the way
Then write them off as mistakes
The stakes are high
And pride can make the kings fall
Ring, calling out to get this big brawl started
On my knees, I got my hands cuffed
Need to put them both together, this world is full of bad luck
Exert the pressure, there's no blood upon my hands bruh
The serpent slithers
Makes its way into the grand bluff

I like the pain
And I like you
But the devil's got a hold on me too
I'd like to think
That I love you
But the devil doesn't play with fools

All puppets to the darkness, woah
Making a deal for the heartless souls
All good, all well
You should fold
Make it hard for me to break these walls
All puppets to the darkness, woah
Making a deal for the heartless souls
All good, all well
You should fold
Make it hard for me to break these walls

"False Art"

I've been sleeping late, and if I'm speaking honestly
My dreams are the only place the thought of you can't bother me
And when I'm wide awake, it takes all of my energy
To tell our friends we've never been this happy

Waiting for the glass house to come down
Waiting to hear that crashing sound
Waiting for the right words to tell you how

I don't wanna be false art
Pretend we're picture perfect
When we're breaking beneath the surface, mmm
I don't wanna be false art
Make love like we deserve it
To cover up what's hurting, hey
I don't wanna be false art

I've been making shit up, but I'll come clean
I finish in the bathroom while you fall asleep without me
And our friends, they say they want this, but they don't see
That it's inevitable, and inevitably

The glass house will come down
Just waiting to hear that crashing sound
Waiting for the right words to tell you how

I don't wanna be false art
Pretend we're picture perfect
When we're breaking beneath the surface (Oh)
I don't wanna be false art
Make love like we deserve it
To cover up what's hurting, hey (Hey)
I don't wanna be false art

I call it love when it isn't
I just like my picture better with you in it

I don't wanna be false art
Pretend we're picture perfect
When we're breaking beneath the surface, mmm
Oh, I don't wanna be false art
Make love like we deserve it
To cover up what's hurting, oh
I don't wanna be false art
I don't wanna be false art

"haven't stopped yet (demo)"

I've been falling in love with you from the moment we met
It's been consistent, a constant persistence and it hasn't stopped yet
It's cold but the window is open, and we sit on the ledge
Breathing in smoke
Breathing in all of this moment
So I don't forget

I've been falling in love with you since September 13th
I didn't know why you were on my mind so frequently
And when you kissed me for the first time I didn't want you to leave
Holding you close
Holding in those three words
That could change everything

On my couch, watching tv
Then you paused it, turned to see me
And you told me that you loved me
Nothing was ever the same
There has never been a moment
When I wish you hadn't paused it
On my couch, as we watched the office
Nothing was ever the same

I've been falling in love with you since the moment we met
And I haven't stopped yet

"Hold On"
(from "Dear Edward" soundtrack)

Everything feels so heavy
I am an acrobat for everyone
Curtains are drawn, I'm not ready
To face the sun

Dress it in prettier colors
When I'm alone, it will all come undone
You carve the space for my sadness
To be seen for once

Hold on to me
I'll hold on to you
The world is moving on without me
Please show me how to

Hold on
Please show me how to

You take my hands, and you tell me
We can stay here just as long as you need
Curtains are drawn 'til you're ready
Safe in this silence, we don't have to leave

Just hold on to me
I'll hold on to you
The world is moving on without me
Please show me how to

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on (Hold on to me)
Hold on (Hold on to me)
Hold on to me
Hold on (Hold on)
Hold on to me
Hold on

"Honeybee (Kelsey)"

You were a light
Like the moon
Shining bright
Wild and free
A bouquet of daises
A lark in a tree

Oh, the mountains, they whisper
Flowers, they bend
When your name is spoken among them
They know who you were
And you'll always be hidden away
Among the sycamore trees
No one could ever replace you
My honeybee, mmm

You were the wind
Wild and undisciplined
You lived without fear
Loved with a passion
That helped people heal

Oh, the mountains, they sing
And the flowers, they grow
When a memory surfaces of a time long ago
We'll never forget you
That much I see as the light dances off
Of the cabin and trees
No one could ever replace you
My honeybee

No one could ever replace you
No one could ever erase you
From their memories
Oh my honeybee
Flying free

Mmm, no one could
No one could ever replace you
My honeybee

"I Think I"

I wrote you a letter
But I cut my tongue sealing it shut
I guess that's what I get for
Not thinking before I speak up

I get underneath your skin
You break easy like porcelain
Funny how opposites attract
I know that you're hurt again
Biting through your cardigan
Never been good at knowing when to hold back

I think I love you
I hurt the ones I love the most
I promise it's not you
Push away when you're too close
I hurt the ones I love the most

I left while you were sleeping
Snuck out through the back and never said goodbye
I thought you knew me better
But every time I do this you're surprised

And I get underneath your skin
You break easy like porcelain
Funny how opposites attract
I know that you're hurt again
This is how it always ends
But we both know it won't stay like that

I think I love you
I hurt the ones I love the most
I promise it's not you
Push away when you're too close
I hurt the ones I love the most

I think I love you
I hurt the ones I love the most
I promise it's not you
Push away when you're too close
I hurt the ones I love the most

"If I Knew Your Name"

Somebody out there
Tastes like a cool spring day
Somebody out there
Will tell me it's okay
They will be as warm as summer rain
Lift me up and take me from the pain
Somebody out there will love me that way

I wish that you were mine, oh
I wish that you would drive slow
I'd kiss you if I knew your name
I miss a love I don't know
Three wishes for my very own Romeo
I'd kiss you only if I knew your name

If I see blue skies above, I think of you
When I see people in love, I think of you
The thought of you is so divine
You'll bring me flowers when I tell you you can be mine
That's how it'll start

Somebody out there
Likes to sleep in until 2
Somebody out there
Knows me better than I do
They will be as sweet as buttercream
Vivid like a Sunday daydream
Somebody out there
Will love me for me

This love will be something to remember
This love will be something for forever
I'll love you even if we're not together
Baby, kiss me just for good measure

When I see blue skies above, I think of you
When I see people in love, I think of you
The thought of you is so divine
You'd bring me flowers when I tell you you can be mine
And that's how it'll start

If I see blue skies above, I think of you
When I see people in love, I think of you
The thought of you is so divine
You'd bring me flowers when I tell you you can be mine
And that's how it'll start

"Just Because"

I know things that you don't know
I know why the flowers grow
Not because they're watered right
Not because they see the light
Just because I love you

I know things that you don't know
Why it rains and why it snows
Not because the heavens cry
Not because of a cloudy sky
Just because I love you

You can try to figure it out
But things like this are just unannounced
It might not make sense
'Cause I haven't told you yet
That I love you
That I love you

Oooh
Ooooh

I know things that you don't know
All my thoughts, I'll never show
Not because I'm unprepared
Not because I'm somewhat scared
Just because I love you
Just because I love you

"Lady In Blue (Pickup Live Session)"

Lady in blue
What are you looking for?
What do you search for in these walls
Lady in blue
Do you find comfort in
All of these souls within these walls

Maybe you wander searching for love
And maybe you wander 'cause that's not enough
Oh lady in blue
I wanna know you

Do you ever get lonely up there, talking to yourself
I can only imagine
Do you ever get tired of being always by yourself
I can only imagine
Imagine that

And maybe you wander searching for love
And maybe you wander 'cause that's not enough
Oh lady in blue
I wanna know you

Lady in blue crying softly
Doesn't notice me as I walk by
Lady in blue turns a corner
And then she is gone with no goodbye

Maybe she's gone until dinnertime
Maybe she's gone for good
Maybe she won't come back until next year

Maybe the lady in the blue chiffon
Finally got what she always wanted
And maybe she'll never come back here

Oh lady in blue just disappeared

"Okay Again"

I couldn't stand in a room with you
And not think about that night
I had to cross the street if we were walking on the same side
It just hurt too much
Too many reminders that I messed things up
But now, we're okay again

I had to block you on Instagram
So I wouldn't feel impatient
I had to stop myself at least once a day
From thinking how her haircut makes us look the same and
It hurt a bunch
Too many reminders that I messed things up
But now, we're okay again

I've been taking my time not trying to get high with all the wrong people
We've been growing apart but I guess that's what happens to some people
And I know we're not friends but I'll always be here if you need people
I'm just glad that we're okay again

We had a party at our place
And you showed up with your best friends
It wasn't weird it wasn't awkward
It was just like seeing an old friend

After four whole months
I don't remember ever seeing you so happy
I guess we knew it wasn't meant to be us
It's been four whole months
I don't remember ever being this happy
I guess we knew it wasn't meant to be us

I've been taking my time trying not to get high with all the wrong people
We've been growing apart but I guess that's what happens to some people
And I know we're not friends but I'll always be here if you need people
I'm just glad that we're okay again

"Oops"
(feat. Ella Atkinson)

(Haha)
(Yeah, yeah yeah)

Pour me up a glass of whiskey
Refill it all the way to the top
I know that you wanna kiss me
If I let you, you could fuck me up

Day and night you get her love
Obviously you're tied up
Baby, you can use my cuffs (Cuffs, cuffs)
She's a bad bitch I agree
Jealousy looks good on me
I'll let you take it off of me
Oh, oh but

I know that you came with her
But if you'd like to leave with someone new
I could be dessert
You just say the word and I'll come through
I know you know the things I've heard
Do you wanna show me if they're true?
This shit probably hurts
Knowing that I'll never cry for you
Oh, you fell in love with me? Oops!
Hmmm

You just stare as she walks towards us
High heels and whiskey in her cup
I know that you wanna touch her
If I let you that would fuck me up

Night and day you get my love
Obviously it ain't enough
You know that I play it rough, whoa
I'm a bad bitch I agree
Jealousy looks good on me
I'll let you rip it off of me

It looks like you came with her
But if you'd like to leave with someone new
I could be dessert
You just say the word and I'll come through
I know you know the things I've heard
Do you wanna show me if they're true?
This shit would probably hurt
If I did the same damn thing to you
Oh, you fell in love with me?
Oops!

You got attached, now you need it
Send me a text, I'll delete it
That picture I sent, you can keep it
'Cause I don't really care that much
You fuck with her and I see it
Mess with my mind for no reason
You play with knives now you're bleedin'
But I don't really care that much, whoa

'Cause I know that you came with her
But if you'd like to leave with someone new
Go ahead and flirt (Go ahead and flirt)
Don't have to say a word, I'm watchin' you
You know I know the things you've heard
And now you realize that they're all true
Baby, it'll hurt (It'll hurt babe)
Soon you'll know the crazy shit I do

Oh, you fell in love with me? (Oh, you fell in love with me)
Oh, you fell in love with me? (Oh, you fell in love)
Oh, you fell in love with me?
Oops

"Panic Room"

I gave up and fell asleep at 5pm
I was just thinking of you
I have been so far removed from my needs
I didn't know that I needed you

Told my sister, sent a picture of us to her phone
She said "it's so weird to see you with somebody"
Emma, what the fuck does that mean, I'm a bit offended
But I guess she's never seen me with somebody
That I like enough to show off to my family

I think that you are made for me
I think it's probably destiny
What are the odds we found each other?

I gave up trying to hold myself back from this
What's the point in doing that?
I have never felt the things I feel when you hold me
I'm so grateful for that

I think that you are made for me
I think it's probably destiny
What are the odds we found each other?

I know that I was made for you
Hold me and that's my panic room
What are the odds we found each other?
What are the odds we found each other?

"Paranoia Purple"

Tell me
Will you leave me lonely
On and on and on, I know you told me
The most important reason why
You'll color in as many lines as I need you

Tell me
When we have no money
And the sirens start their callin'
You say slow down
Slow down, come on
Slow down

And this paranoia purple turns to green
And nothing is as simple as it seems
What's happening to me?

Say now
When my life is over
Will you find somebody good enough to hold you?
Someone like my Abigail?
To tell you all is good and well like me now

Say now
I feel my colors show how
I think it's almost time for me to go now
Go now, go now
And this paranoia purple turns to grey
And all that's good and well
It melts away
Until we meet again

Ooh oooh
Mmmh-mhm

How could I forget about you now
How could I forget about you now
Forget about you now

"PERFECT"

Happy lies
Sheltered lives
Who knows where
We go when we die?
If we're good do we get a prize?

Can I say
By the way
I like the way you smile when I cry
Do you need to know why?

We fall and then we fall again
We talk, but do we really make amends?
Tell me what's wrong, I'll write a song
You light the bong and we'll forget, again

We wanna change but do we know how?
We're comfortable and so we stay out of it
Let it run its course
Say no more and I'll pretend it doesn't exist

We're perfect
Perfectly fucked, certainly screwed
But isn't that how you sing the in denial blues
We can argue then sit
Staring up at walls too thick to punch through
But that's what happens with the in denial blues

Happy lies
Bloodshot eyes
I'm okay but are you alright?
If I guess do I get a prize?

Say my name
No more blame
I like the way you yell when I cry
I don't know why

We fall and then we fall again
We talk, but do we really make amends?
Tell me what's wrong, I'll write a song
You light the bong and we'll forget, again

We wanna change but do we know how?
I love you but it seems we've grown out of it
I care about you, always got you
Never doubt my love cause it's that real shit

We're perfect
Perfectly fucked, certainly screwed
But isn't that how you sing the in denial blues
We can argue then sit
Staring up at walls too thick to punch through
But that's what happens with the in denial blues

"physics or fate (voice memo)"

Why do I keep
Coming back to this?
It's like a book I can't quite figure out
So I read it in pieces

Sometimes it hurts
Gotta set it down for a bit
But I always come back to this
Ooh

Why do I keep
Running into this?
Every time I make a wrong turn
I end up on your doorstep

Sometimes it hurts
Gotta step away for a bit
But I always come back to this
I always come back to this

And maybe I'm stupid
For thinking the world might end
And maybe I'm stupid
For thinking you'd be with me when it did
And maybe you'd be better off
If you never saw me again
Again

But God damn I keep
Comin' back to this
I try to understand
But I can't make it make sense

Maybe it's time to just
Kinda go with it
'Cause even if its not now
I will end up here somehow
It's physics or it's fate
And I can't stop it

I always come back to this
I always come back to this

"Ruined"

Those candles that you bought me for Christmas
I can't burn them 'cause they smell like you
And every time I walk into a Starbucks, I see you at every table
It's been a while since I've had cold brew

Don't you know how hard it is to find a decent guy
In this city of four-thousand? Where everybody looks like you?
Don't even get me started on the way you saw this song online
And called, told me you didn't, but you did and I have proof that

You ruined The 1975, now I listen and think about getting high
In your bedroom, windows open
Mom is home but we're still smoking
You ruined The 1975, now I listen and cry 'cause you sang
"We share friends in Soho"
While you told me that none of your friends know

And I hated you for that but it's been two years now
And I really just hate you
For making me hate my favorite band

You broke my heart then went away to college
You were only fifteen minutes down the road
And I always thought you'd show up to say sorry
But as time went on, I started to lose hope

Don't you know how hard it is to find a decent guy
When you never gave me closure? What the hell was I to do?
Don't even get me started on the way you saw this song online
I guess it must've thrown you 'cause you called and said you knew that

I stayed quiet, but I probably should've told you
Every night I would cry and wish I didn't know you
I said nothing and now I got issues
I'll bill you for the tear-stained tissues
Oh, I don't think you have that kind of dough 'cause

You ruined The 1975, now I listen and think about getting high
In your bedroom, windows open
Mom is home but we're still smoking
You ruined The 1975, now I listen and cry 'cause you sang
"We share friends in Soho"
While you told me that none of your friends know

And I hated you for that but it's been two years now
And I really just hate you
For making me hate my favorite band

"Shifting"

My life is shifting
I can feel it in the way I smile
I need to go, I need to get out
I haven't felt this in a while

My life is shifting (ooh ooh)
And it's all because of you (ooh ooh ooh)
I need to get up and get over
But it's hard getting over you

Oh, (ooh ooh ooh)
I want you to be happy
You deserve the world (the world)
If I could pluck it out of the universe
You'd be the first one I'd call (first one I'd call)

(Ooh ooh ooh)
I hope someone loves you
In all the ways I never could (I never could)
One day, maybe five years from now
I'll bump into you

So please never forget me
I know it is time (it is time)
Honeydew burns easier
Love you, and that's a goodbye

"so are you (demo)"

It's ok to cry
Every day if you have to
It's ok to sleep
Peace from the war

It's alright to sing
Let it bring joy to the sorrow
It's alright to cry
Some more

I don't know your pain but I will fight
I won't let this go even if doing what's right
Isn't easy
I'm tired, believe me, but
So are you

I don't know your pain but I will stand
I won't let this go so take my hand
It's not easy
I'm tired, believe me, but
So are you
So are you

It's ok to cry
Or to laugh if you need to
It's ok to sleep
Peace from the war
