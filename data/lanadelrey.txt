"Drive By (For K)"

It was a drive-by Sunday night
Most of us were in bed all right
I turned down the light
Then I heard the sirens
Interrupt the silence

Is this what you wished
To commit a crime?
Is this what you wished
To commit a crime?
Is this what you wished
To commit a crime, commit a crime, commit a crime?

He was a nice guy, really bright
Making money's hard to do right
Guilty was his plight
Now he's in a jail cell
For some thirty years now

Is this what you wished
To be serving time?
Is this what you wished
To be serving time?
Is this what you wished
To be serving time, serving time, serving time?

K's a friend of mine
I think about him as he does time
Miss his white wine
Funny I don't feel free
Even though it's not me

Is this what you wished
To leave me behind?
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind?
Is this what you wished
To leave me behind, me behind, me behind?

Last year they decided
That his time is up and then he got retried
Double homicide
Sent him on to death row
Not to hang around though

Is this what you wished
Did you want to die?
Is this what you wished
Did you want to die?
Is this what you wished
Did you want to die, want to die, want to die?
Did you want to die, want to die, want to die, want to die?
Did you want to die?

"Next To Me"

Another day is over
Another day is done
Now I'm getting closer
To the rising sun

Hey, there, what you doing?
Would you like a little company?
Hey, man, how you doing?
Would you like to sit next to me?

Another day is over
Another day is done
Another night I'm waiting
Waiting for the sun

Hey, there, what you doing?
Would you like a little company?
Hey, man, how you doing?
Would you like to sit next to me?

Well, I don't know, little lady
You're awfully pretty
But I'm a nice man, I live a nice life
I have a nice house, I have a great wife
And I'm tired of making
Decisions without thinking

Another moon is shining
Another evening come
Another hour unwinding
Till the night is done

Hey, man, what you doing?
Would you like a little company?
Hey, there, how are you doing?
Would you like to sit next to me, next to me, next to me?

"A Star For Nick"

Well you know it and I know it
I'm gonna be a star
You won't, you won't get me very far

Don't say hello
It's already time to go
Oh, the wind is carrying me home
Me home, me home again

Well you know it and I know it
I'm gonna be a star
You won't, you won't get me very far

You saw life back in the countryside
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh, my soul rise up and go beyond, beyond
To what you know

"My Momma"

My momma wouldn't say you were a nice guy
But you're under forty and you have a job
My momma wouldn't say you was a good boy
But you're making money and you're working hard so

I'm gonna take you on, I don't feel like it's wrong
Me and my momma, we don't get along

My momma, she would say your hair was too long
But your hair exactly is what I like the best
And my momma she would say you was a hoodlum
But I'd have known a hoodlum and you don't pass the test

I'm gonna take you on, I don't feel like it's wrong
Me and my momma, we don't get along

Oh, baby, you're standing so close, I can't back down
You're smiling and I know, I'm over and done now
I am done now

My momma'd say that it was wrong to see you
I lied just to meet you, I lied to get in
My momma she would say that I deceived you
But that's the only way I knew how to begin

So maybe you got your own problems, who doesn't?
I'm crazy, you're addicted, we are all of a sudden

My momma, she would love you like I love you
If she ever met you, if she ever knew
My momma, she would fall right on top of you
If she ever saw you, she'd be smitten, too

I'll never take you home, I want you all for my own
Don't let my momma hear your pretty song
I'm gonna take you on, I don't feel like it's wrong
Me and my momma, we don't get along

"Bad Disease"

Well, there is something about watching a crime
It makes me want to go out and make it all mine
It's something about seeing you fight
It makes me want to go out tonight

I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
To fall into
Yeah, it's true

There's something about seeing him die
That puts it all into perspective and I
Want to stay home, be left alone
Someone make my mind up so I don't have to decide

I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
To fall into
Yeah, I do

There's some reason why I can't sit still
Every waking moment I feel so unfulfilled
I try to lie down, but I don't know how
Baby, when I'm sleeping, it feels less like I am dreaming

Oh, my god
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees

There's a fear I have of feeling real bad
I'm fine now, if I find out that I'm not I'll be sad
I try to quiet the thoughts in the night
Oh, they got me thinking, I'd be happier just drinking

It's not true
And I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees
Oh, no
I got a bad disease
Will no one help me please?
Not even you?

"Out With A Bang"

Little bits and pieces fall into the corners
Box of broken laces, lined up in an order
I'll do what you tell me, we can have it your way
I'll tell you the future, you tell me your story

I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang

Smiles from a stranger, seem to change your day when
You were just about to go and throw your towel in
Lately I've been thinking about making changes
It's been on my mind for some time and I'm anxious

I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang

Scowling like the sunshine, set on Sarasota
Happy like a twister over Oklahoma
Clear as Penny Mason lying in a coma
This is how I feel when all my hurt is over

I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang

Meet me in the morning, wrap your arms around me
Tell me that it's over, now that you have found me
Walk me to the river, see the willow bowing
Carry me into the water, now we're drowning

We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
We're going to go home again

"Dear Elliot"

You didn't think about anyone else
You didn't think about any of us when you left that place
You didn't wanna go anywhere else
Nothing could satisfy you 'til you left
So you went away

Where'd you go?
Where are you now?
I ask about, so many of my friends
Oh, about their ends
What about us?
Are we just dust on the floor again?
I thought we were on the mend

You really put me in quite a position
You got me struggling as a musician with a song
You like to write about all of your problems
Put them in songs because you think it would solve them
But you're wrong

Why did you go?
I guess I know
Maybe my question is, why must it come to this?
You talk about being strong, yeah
And how I want to be you and your melody

Trying to learn about something important
But you keep taking up space, you're annoying
But I love you so
Yeah, you already know

They're trying to teach me about new ways of living
They're trying to teach me about ways of forgiving
But you make it hard
You're such a bad, bad boy

I love you anyway
No matter what they say
You are not a prude, but you are on the move
I care about how this turns out
It's just more than I ever knew how to fight
I guess I won't

Tell me I have to, tell me I have to
I know you could
I said I know you could
Where are you now?
I ask about

"Try Tonight"

Can't put my finger on it
But I know I want it
I'm willing to try another way
That is, if I get by another day
Back and forth, I don't get anywhere
And I've been searching everywhere

And I'll try tonight
Just try tonight

Happy as the moon shine
Sifting in the night-time
ClichÃ©s find a home inside of him
When he enters all of the lights go dim
He's so sure he's got a tragic lifestyle
And I'm so sure I can make that man smile

And I'll try tonight
Just try tonight

A dark room in the night-time
Is how he spends all his time
If he could go on without your help
Then he would do it all by himself
But I don't think he got strength to muster
And he don't got a lot â lacklustre

He'll try tonight
To not get high
He'll try tonight
To not get high
But he will, he will, he will, yes he will

"Peace (All You Need)"

You have a right
To live your life
Like no one else does
Like no one else might
If you have visions
Come on and live them out

All you need
Is some peace
While you are here
Just let go
Till you are home, dear

I had a dream
When I was young
I dreamt our lives were
Going to be found
When we were always
Waiting to live

All you need
Is some peace
While you are here
Just let go
I'll be it all, dear

You have the choice
To hear the noise
Or hear the sweet sound
Of your sweet voice
I know I've heard it
I heard it in my sleep

All you need
Is some peace
While you are here
Just let go
Don't say no, dear

Wake up each night
At the same time
Pull up the blind
And look outside
And in the orange light
The fog is rising

This is life
The still night
Peace in the quiet
Happiness
Is the sky

"I'm Indebted To You (How Do You Know Me So Well?)"

What an unusual name, you said
What a spectacular redhead
You really seem like a prize to me
And you are so mysterious
When you are not delirious
Oh what you mean to me

And she said, how do you know me so well
After only one night?
How do I love you, tell me
With all of my might

I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you
Always

There's something she doesn't know about
A secret he doesn't show about
A sensitive side all his own, oh my
She got her skeletons as well
Some secrets he know she'd never tell
People who keep her alone

And she said
"How did I know you so well, why am I not surprised?"
He said, "Baby, go to hell."
And that was the demise of their love
Don't ever pick up a man if you don't think he'll understand
Don't ever trust yourself if you have a history of being a loving fool

So that's what she got when she married him
A lifetime promise to carry him
Him and his every second of need
I do not know you so well
Not more than that one night
Do you still love me, oh tell me
With all of your might?

I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you, my love

"Pretty Baby"

Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I touch you
Then I won't touch you no more, yeah
Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I love you
Then throw my love on the floor

My mean daddy, my bad baby
Don't you want me?
I don't believe you when you say
You want to leave

Darling, honey, if you don't think that you're gonna want me
Then, honey, let me know
Listen, honey, I don't wanna keep thinking you love me
Just to find out you don't

My mean daddy, my bad baby, don't you want me?
I don't believe you when you say you want to leave

Aren't you gonna miss me?
Honey, I'll miss you
I just wanna kiss you, tonight

Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I hold you
Then, honey, let me go
Pretty baby, if you don't like the way that I told you
Then, baby, tell me so

My mean daddy, my bad baby, don't you want me?
I don't believe you when you say you want to leave

"Aviation"

Do you think I'm crazy
For considering aviation?
I'm a fan of flying
Why not do it for the nation?
Cause I have nothing else to do
This summer but commit it to you
Have a big degree in philosophy
But I don't know what I want to be

So I'm going into aviation, yeah, mom
I'm going into aviation, yeah, dad
Going into aviation
I'm going into aviation

Do you think I'm crazy
Cause I'm up and leaving, baby?
Well, I ain't got nobody
And I ain't got no money, baby, yeah
I feel high as I might tonight
So lean back and enjoy the ride
And the weather is clear, yeah, nobody is near
The future is not here

So I'm going into aviation, yeah, mom
I'm going into aviation, yeah, dad
Going into aviation
I'm going into aviation

Do you think I'm crazy
Cause I'm going to Pensacola?
Where nobody knows me
Where someone could just start over
I'll be all right in a month or two
Cause it's warm there in the winter, too
Think New York is great, I really like the state
But it's time to be on my way

I'm going into aviation, yeah, mom
I'm going into aviation, yeah, dad
I'm gonna take a vacation, yeah, man
Fly fighter jets all over the nation
Fly fighter jets all over the nation

"Move"

Snow is coming down like rain
I'm at it myself again
A little tired, even more confused
Come on, baby, don't be shy
You can say what make you high
I see the way you be lying, be abused

I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, don't you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
I don't care what you think

Breathing getting fast again
Now I'll start my worrying
When will I learn that there ain't nothing I can do?
Jesus was a dying man
If he can't do it, no one can
When will you learn that we ain't nothing without you?

We don't need anybody when we're down
We don't really find it hard to get around
We'll find our own way back to town
And oh, don't you tell us how we need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
We don't, we don't care what you think

I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, don't you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody but me
And I don't care what you think

"Junkie Pride"

You have this way of making me
Say the opposite of everything I mean
I kiss you, I hug you
But I could not feel less connected from you

I know I wanted all this in the beginning, I really tried
I know I caught you at a not-so-happy time of your life
My dreams are bigger than your junkie pride

I don't quite fit the part of
She who loses everything and falls into insanity
The sunbeams mean nothing
If you can't find the light shining in one thing

I know I wanted all this in the beginning, I really tried
I know I caught you at a not-so-happy time of your life
My dreams are bigger than your junkie pride

It's fine if you're hateful
As long as all in all you remain grateful

It made me nervous to know you didn't like me, I really tried
The way I'm feeling in this moment, it can't last my whole life
My dreams are bigger than your junkie pride

"Birds Of A Feather"

Met you in front of a diner and you had blue hair
You were so nice
You were from L.A. but you were all there
You were all right

So many people say that they have it together
But I think you're a nice guy
And I think we could be birds of a feather

Met you in front of a diner and you were so sweet
Made my heart beat, oh, my, my, my, my, my
I met you with your mother and she had green shoes
She was so cool, it was fine, fine, fine, fine, fine

So many people say that they have it together
But I think you're a nice guy
And I think we could be birds of a feather
Oh, feather, oh, birds

You were sorting pictures and you gave me one
Of a nun who was playing the drums
She was crazy, her name was Katie
I think you're so fun

So many people say that they have it together
But I think you're a nice guy
And I think we could be birds of a feather

You don't think I'm that strange, you're so weird
That's 'cause you're so queer
But who's not these days?
You wear purple socks and you still like Purple Haze

So many people think that you have it together
But they don't see you crying in the shower
Bet I can make you better
'Cause you make me better
Yeah, you make me better
Yeah, you make me better

"Kill Kill"

Bound up the stairs
I'm in the shower
Do you know I am going to leave you?
Do you know I am going to leave you?

I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love, lying in the sand
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can, mm

Tell me about Ray and his girl
Do I know Ray has gone to meet you?
Love you, I do
Stay here, I won't
The stars fade from your eyes

I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love, lying in the sand
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can

One, two, make it fun

"Queen Of The Gas Station"

Give me coffee, king-sized cup

That's for me to know and you to make up

Love casinos

With Slurpee machines and organs playing
Preferably with smoking inside

And I'd be real pleased if we could find one just like it
Again, again
Again, again
Again, again
Again, again, again, again, again

"Oh Say Can You See"

Oh say can you see
My stars
The night time is almost ours
To wander through alleys
And look at the bars
Nighttime is almost ours

The headlights from passing cars
They illuminate my face and
Leave me the dark
The voice of Nirvana says
"Come as you are"
And I will
Nighttime is almost ours

The sway of the hips and arms
Will cradle you from afar
They swing 'til you're tired
And send you to Mars
Nighttime is almost ours

"Gramma"

Gramma said she'll leave the lights on for me
Gramma said the flags are waving for me

"For K Part 2"

Alright, you caught me, I don't play a good guitar but
What do you want from me, it's just a stupid bar and
I didn't promise anything, no
You think I'm pretty and you like the way I talk
I like your music and you like the way I walk
So, I think we're gonna get along

I like the way you wear your sweater off your shoulder
The way your hair comes down and makes you look older
How are you getting so handsome, my boy?

Pretty baby
Pretty baby

The way your face is shaped, I wonder if you know
The way you stand up and your silhouette glows
I'm electrified, I'll be up all night now
Use that voice, sing that song
And tell me to come on, to come on, come on
You won't hear no, you won't hear no

Pretty baby
Pretty baby
Pretty baby

"Jump"

Palm trees in black and white
Last thing I saw before I died
Palm trees in black and white
Was the last thing I saw before I died
Right line, right man
Right mixture of cocaine and heroin

Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you, do you wanna?

Hair thinning in the wind
Cadillac convertible with him
I was shot at 2 AM
You got the grin of a very old man

Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you, do you wanna?

Palm trees in black and white
You are a junkie on your window smiling wide
Palm trees in black and white
Lean forward and you close your eyes
Last fight, fuck them
Last words before you went under again

Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you wanna jump, jump, jump?
Do you, do you wanna?

Just do what you love
Just do what you can
Just do what you love
Just do what you can
Just do what you love
Do it better than
(Do you wanna?)

"Mermaid Motel"

Maybe we could go to Coney Island
Maybe I could sing the national anthem
Buy a white sweater for the last white day of the summer
Buy my purple wig for my mermaid video
Walk back to where I live in my motel on Neptune (Avenue)

You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off

(Maybe we could go to) Suede Tokyo
Or see Van Halen at their reunion show
Heavy metal hour on TV
Diamond Dave and Ray Lee
And you salute me, Miss America
Because I am, I am

You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off

Maybe we could go to Coney Island
Maybe I could sing you to sleep
God bless the universe, god bless the ocean
God bless you and god bless me
God bless you and god bless me

You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off

"Raise Me Up (Mississippi South)"

It's like you said
It's all been done before
I don't have to talk pretty for them no more

It's the voodoo
Mississippi south
69 million stars
Birds are flying out of my mouth
Spirits creeping in my yard
Hold my head
It's tilting back
Something's dancing me around
Putting crystals on our neck
Lifting my feet off
The ground, the ground

Ray, Ray

"Pawn Shop Blues"

Well, I didn't know it would come to this but
That's what happens when you're on your own
And you're alright with letting nice things go

Well, I pawned the earrings that you gave me
Golden metal flowers dangling
And I almost cried as I sold them off
And I don't mind living on bread and oranges, no, no
But I got to get to and from where I come
And it's gon' take money to go

Oh, no
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh

In the name of higher consciousness
I let the best man I knew go
'Cause it's nice to love and be loved
But it's better to know all you can know
I said it's nice to love and be loved
But I'd rather know what God knows

Oh, no
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no
Oh, no

I can do this once more
No man can keep me together
Been broken since I was born

Do I make you feel like Christmas time?
Put me in a party dress one time
Love me 'til I see the sunshine

Say you'll never leave me
Say you'll never leave me

Tell me that I'm just a baby, honey
Beat me and tell me no one will love me
Better than you do, better than you do

Keep out the stars, turn out the lights
This little world is yours tonight
Dance me all around the room

"Yayo"

I like the snake on your tattoo
I like the ivy and the ink blue
Yayo
Yes, you
Yayo

You have to take me right now
From this dark trailer park life now
Yayo
How now
Yayo

Put me onto your black motorcycle
50s' baby doll dress for my "I do"
It only takes two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama

Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Let me put on a show

I need you like a baby when I hold you
Like a druggy, like I told you
Yayo

Hello, heaven, you are a tunnel-lined
With yellow lights on a dark night

"Born To Die"

Why? ("Got that?")
Who, me? ("Louder!")
Why? ("Got that?")

Feet don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping at the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey ("Louder!")

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laughâlet's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane ("Louder!", "Alright!")
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and Iâwe were born to die

Lost, but now I am found
I can see that once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get, scared that I couldn't find
All the answers I need ("Louder!")

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laughâlet's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane ("Louder!", "Alright")
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and Iâwe were born to die ("Louder!", "Got that")
We were born to die ("Louder!", "Alright")
We were born to die
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

So don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laughâlet's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane ("Louder!", "Alright")
So choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and Iâwe were born to die

("Got that?")
("Louder!")
We were born to die
("Got that?")
("Louder!")
("Got that?")
("Louder!")
("Got that?")
("Louder!")
("Got that?")
("Louder!")

"Off To The Races"

My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart

He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a LA crass
Way about me
He loves me
With every beat of his cocaine heart

Swimming pool glimmering darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples
You sitting sipping on your Black Cristal

Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Give me them gold coins, give me them coins

And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out

Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

My old man is a tough man
But he's got a soul as sweet as blood-red jam
And he shows me
He knows me
Every inch of my tar-black soul

He doesn't mind I have a flat broke-down life
In fact he says he thinks it's what he might like
About me
Admires me
The way I roll like a rolling stone

Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom, Chateau Marmont
Slipping on my red dress, putting on my make-up
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac
Fumes, says it feels like heaven to him

Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me, give me them coins

And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out

Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth

Yo I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is
Tight and I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you but I'm going down

God I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raising hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it

My old man is a thief and I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord to watch over us
Take him when he may, if he may
I'm not afraid to say
That I'd die without him

Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you

You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said "Hon'
You never looked so beautiful as you do now, my man."

And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is
Down and now we're going in
To Las Vegas chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin

Boy you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

You are my one true love

"Blue Jeans"

Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer

You were sorta punk rock,
I grew up on hip-hop
But you fit me better
Than my favourite sweater,
And I know that love is mean,
And love hurts
But I still remember
That day we met in December,
Oh, baby!

I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more
Than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh, baby, say you'll remember, oh, baby, ooh
I will love you 'til the end of time

Big dreams, gangster
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, "No please, stay here.
We don't need no money we can make it all work."

But he headed out on Sunday,
Said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waitin',
Anticipatin', and pacin'
But he was chasing paper
"Caught up in the game."
That was the last I heard

I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more
Than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh, baby, say you'll remember, oh, baby, ooh
I will love you 'til the end of time

You went out every night
And, baby, that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did I'd be by your side
'Cause I'mma ride or die
Whether you fail or fly
Well, shit at least you tried.

But when you walked out that door,
A piece of me died
I told you I wanted more,
But that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before
We were dancing all night
Then they took you away,
Stole you out of my life
You just need to remember...

I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more
Than those bitches before
Say you'll remember, oh baby, say you'll remember, oh, baby, ooh
I will love you 'til the end of time

"Video Games"

Swinging in the backyard
Pull up in your fast car
Whistling my name

Open up a beer
And you say, "Get over here
And play a video game."

I'm in his favorite sundress
Watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown

I say, "You the bestest."
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on

Go play a video game

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do

Singing in the old bars
Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame

Kissing in the blue dark
Playing pool and wild darts
Video games

He holds me in his big arms
Drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of

Watching all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do

Now you do
Now you do
Now you do

Now, now you do
Now you do
Now you do

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do

Now, now you do
Now you do
Now you do
(Now you do)
Now, now you do
Now you do
Now you do

"Diet Mountain Dew"

You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But, baby, I want you, I wantâ

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we hit it now, low-down and gritty?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Baby, put on heart-shaped sunglasses
'Cause we gonna take a ride
I'm not gonna listen to what the past says
I been waiting up all night
Take another drag, turn me to ashes
Ready for another lie?
Says he's gonna teach me just what fast is
Say it's gonna be alright

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we hit it now, low-down and gritty?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Let's take Jesus off the dashboard
Got enough on his mind
We both know just what we're here for
Saved too many times
Maybe I like this roller coaster
Maybe it keeps me high
Maybe the speed, it brings me closer
I could sparkle up your eye

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City

"National Anthem"

Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?

I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on?" He said, "Yes" (Yes, yes)

Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, making me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact
Kiss, kiss

I sing the national anthem while I'm standing over your body
Hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron?
He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
("Yes, of course I will, my darling")

Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, making me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of
Sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon

Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, making me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Sugar sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success

"Dark Paradise"

All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh
That's how you sang it

Loving you forever, can't be wrong
Even though you're not here, won't move on
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh
That's how we played it

And there's no remedy
For memory
Your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me
And telling me
That everything is fine
But I wish I was dead
(Dead like you)

Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you
Won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you
Won't be waiting on the other side

All my friends ask me why I stay strong
Tell 'em when you find true love it lives on
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ahh
That's why I stay here

And there's no remedy
For memory
Your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me
And telling me
That everything is fine
But I wish I was dead
(Dead like you)

Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you
Won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you
Except in my dreams tonight

Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight

There's no relief
I see you in my sleep
And everybody's rushing me
But I can feel you touching me
There's no release
I feel you in my dreams
Telling me I'm fine

Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side (So tell me)
Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you
Except in my dreams tonight

Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight

"Radio"

Not even they can stop me now
Boy, I be flying overhead
Their heavy words can't bring me down
Boy, I've been raised from the dead

No one even knows how hard life was
I don't even think about it now because
I finally found you
(Oh, sing it to me)

Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?
Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?

American dreams came true somehow
I swore I'd chase 'em 'til I was dead
I heard the streets were paved with gold
That's what my father said

No one even knows what life was like
Now I'm in L.A. and it's paradise
I finally found you
(Oh, sing it to me)

Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?
Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?

Sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?
Sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
I finally found you
(Oh, sing it to me)

Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio

"Carmen"

Darling, darling
Doesn't have a problem
Lying to herself
'Cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarming, honestly
How charming she can be
Fooling everyone
Telling 'em she's having fun

She says, "You don't want to be like me
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen
I'm dying, I'm dying"
She says, "You don't want to get this way
Famous and dumb at an early age
Lying, I'm lying"

The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shining
Like lightning, whoa, whoa
White lightning

Carmen, Carmen
Staying up 'til morning
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarming, truly
How disarming you can be
Eating soft ice cream
Coney Island queen

She says, "You don't want to be like me
Looking for fun, getting high for free
I'm dying, I'm dying"
She says, "You don't want to get this way
Street walk at night and a star by day
It's tiring, tiring"

The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies
Bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shining
Like lightning, whoa, whoa
White lightning

Baby's all dressed up with nowhere to go
That's the little story of the girl you know
Relying on the kindness of strangers
Tying cherry knots
Smiling, doing party favors
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song, song, now the camera's on
And you're alive again

Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
Tu as besoin de moi, tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie
Tu ne peux vivre sans moi
Et je mourrais sans toi
Je tuerais pour toi

The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies
Bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shining
Like lightning, whoa, whoa
White lightning
Like lightning, whoa, whoa
White lightning

Darling, darling
Doesn't have a problem
Lying to herself
'Cause her liquor's top shelf

"Million Dollar Man"

You said I was the most exotic flower
Holding me tight in our final hour

I don't know how you convince them and get them, boy
I don't know what you do, it's unbelievable
And I don't know how you get over, get over
Someone as dangerous, tainted and flawed as you

One for the money, two for the show
I love you honey, I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

You got the world but baby at what price?
Something so strange, hard to define

It isn't that hard boy to like you or love you
I'd follow you down down down
You're unbelievable
If you're going crazy just grab me and take me
I'd follow you down down down, anywhere anywhere

One for the money, two for the show
I love you honey, I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

One for the money, two for the show
I love you honey, I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?

"Summertime Sadness"

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feeling alive

Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

(1, 2, 3, 4)

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm feeling electric tonight
Cruising down the coast going 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

(1, 2, 3, 4)

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Think I'll miss you forever
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky
Later's better than never
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive (drive, drive)

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

"This Is What Makes Us Girls"

Remember how we used to party up all night?
Sneaking out, looking for a taste of real life
Drinking in the small town firelight
(Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice)
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Walking down the streets as they whistle, "Hi, hi"
Stealing police cars with the senior guys
Teachers said we'd never make it out alive

There she was, my new best friend
High heels in her hand, swaying in the wind
Oh, she starts to cry, mascara running down her little Bambi eyes
"Lana, how I hate those guys"

This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Something that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen (Happen, happen)

And that's where the beginning of the end begun
Everybody knew that we had too much fun
We were skipping school and drinking on the job
With the boss
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Baby's table dancing at the local dive
Cheering our names in the pink spotlight
Drinking cherry schnapps in the velvet night

Yeah, we used to go break into the hotel
Glimmering, we'd swim
Running from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screaming, "Get us while we're hot, get us while we're hot"
(C'mon, take a shot)

This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Something that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen (Happen, happen)

The prettiest in-crowd that you had ever seen
Ribbons in our hair and our eyes gleamed mean
A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens
And you know something?
They were the only friends I ever had
We got into trouble and when stuff got bad
I got sent away, I was waving on the train platform
Crying 'cause I know I'm never coming back

This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Something that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen, oh

"Without You"

Everything I want, I have
Money, notoriety, and rivieras
I even think I found God
In the flashbulbs of the pretty cameras
Pretty cameras, pretty cameras
Am I glamorous? Tell me, am I glamorous?

Hello? Hello?
Ca-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll if you wanna see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

Summertime is nice and hot
And my life is sweet like vanilla is
Gold and silver-lined, my heart
But burned into my brain, all these stolen images
Stolen images, baby, stolen images
Can you picture it? Babe, that life we could've lived

Hello? Hello?
Ca-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll if you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

We were two kids just trying to get out
Lived on the dark side of the American dream
We would dance all night, play our music loud
When we grew up, nothing was what it seemed

Hello? Hello?
Ca-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll if you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they think that I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you

Hello? Hello?
Ca-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll if you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they think that I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing if I can't have you

"Lolita"

Would you be mine?
Would you be my baby tonight?
Could be kissing my fruit punch lips in the bright sunshine
'Cause I like you quite a lot, everything you got
Don't you know?
It's you that I adore
Though I make the boys fall like dominoes

Kiss me in the D-A-R-K, dark tonight
(D-A-R-K, do it my way)
Kiss me in the P-A-R-K, park tonight
(P-A-R-K, let them all say)

Hey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skipping rope, skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feeling the heat even when the sun goes down

I could be yours, I could be your baby tonight
Topple you down from your sky forty stories high
Shining like a god, can't believe I caught you and so
Look at what I bought, not a second thought, oh, Romeo

Kiss me in the D-A-R-K, dark tonight
(D-A-R-K, do it my way)
Kiss me in the P-A-R-K, park tonight
(P-A-R-K, let them all say)

Hey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skipping rope, skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feeling the heat even when the sun goes down

I want my cake and I wanna eat it too
I want to have fun and be in love with you
I know that I'm a mess with my long hair
And my suntan, short dress, bare feet, I don't care
What they say about me, what they say about me
Because I know that it's L-O-V-E
You make me happy, you make me happy
And I never listen to anyone
(Let them all say!)

Hey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skipping rope, skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feeling the heat even when the sun goes down

"Lucky Ones"

Let's get out of this town, baby, we're on fire
Everyone around here seems to be going down, down, down
If you stick with me, I can take you higher and higher
It feels like all of our friends are lost
Nobody's found, found, found

I got so scared, I thought no one could save me
You came along, scooped me up like a baby

Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time

Boy, get into my car, got a bad desire
You know that we'll never leave if we don't get out now, now, now
You're a careless con and you're a crazy liar, but baby
Nobody can compare to the way you get down, down, down

I tried so hard to act nice like a lady
You taught me that it was good to be crazy

Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time

Feels like, feels like, you know it feels like
Falling in love for the first time
Feels like, you know it feels like
Falling in love

Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time

"Ride"

I been out on that open road
But you can be my full-time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
But you can be my full-time baby, hot or cold

Don't break me down (Don't break me down)
I been traveling too long (I been traveling too long)
I been trying too hard (I been trying too hard)
With one pretty song (With one pretty song)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life and art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it, light 'til dark

Don't leave me now (Don't leave me now)
Don't say goodbye (Don't say goodbye)
Don't turn around (Don't turn around)
Leave me high and dry (Leave me high and dry)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
It's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just ride

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

"American"

Play house, put my favorite record on
Get down, get your crystal method on
You were like tall, tan, driving 'round the city
Flirting with the girls like you're so pretty
"Springsteen is the King, don't ya think?"
I was like, "Hell yeah, that guy can sing"
Like ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child
Your skin so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Drive fast, I can almost taste it now
L.A., I don't even have to fake it now

You were way ahead of the trend, get, get it
"Elvis is the best, hell yes"
"Honey, put on that party dress"
Like ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child

But I'm praying for you

Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child
Your skin so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud

"Cola (Pussy)"

My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
My eyes are wide like cherry pies
I gots a taste for men who are older
It's always been so it's no surprise

Ah, he's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy
(I come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby

Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Oh, oh yeah

I fall asleep in an American flag
I wear my diamonds on Skid Row
I pledge allegiance to my dad
For teaching me everything he knows

Ah, he's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy
(I come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby

Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

Drugs, suck it up, like vanilla icys
Don't treat me rough, treat me really niceys
Decorate my neck, diamantes ices
Why, come on, come on
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh yeah)

Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine

"Body Electric"

Elvis is my daddy
Marilyn's my mother
Jesus is my bestest friend
We don't need nobody
'Cause we got each other
Or at least I pretend

We get down every Friday night
Dancing and grinding in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry
We're feeling alright
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind
(I said, "Don't worry 'bout it")

I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric
Sing that body electric
Sing that body electric
I'm on fire
Sing that body electric

Whitman is my daddy
Monaco's my mother
Diamonds are my bestest friend
Heaven is my baby
Suicide's her father
Opulence is the end

We get down every Friday night
Dancing and grinding in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry
We're feeling alright
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind
(I said, "Don't worry 'bout it")

I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric
Sing that body electric
Sing that body electric
I'm on fire
Sing that body electric

My clothes still smell like you
And all the photographs say you're still young
I pretend I'm not hurt
And go about the world like I'm having fun

We get crazy every Friday night
Drop it like it's hot in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry
Feeling alright
Mary swaying softly to her heart's delight

I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric
Sing that body electric
Sing that body electric
I'm on fire
Sing that body electric

I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric, baby

"Blue Velvet"

She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars

She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May, her tender sighs
Love was ours

Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left, gone was the glow of

Blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory
Through the years

And I still can see blue velvet through my tears

"Gods & Monsters"

L.A., L.A
L.A., L.A

In the land of gods and monsters
I was an angel living in the garden of evil
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shining like a fiery beacon

You got that medicine I need
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
Me and God, we don't get along, so now I sing

No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost

In the land of gods and monsters
I was an angel looking to get fucked hard
Like a groupie incognito, posing as a real singer
Life imitates art

You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart, please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said, "Baby, that's alright with me"

No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost

When you talk, it's like a movie and you're making me crazy
'Cause life imitates art
If I get a little prettier, can I be your baby?
You tell me life isn't that hard

No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost

"Yayo"

I like the snake on your tattoo
I like the ivy and the ink blue
Yayo
Yes, you
Yayo

You have to take me right now
From this dark trailer park life now
Yayo
How now
Yayo

Put me onto your black motorcycle
50s' baby doll dress for my "I do"
It only takes two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama

Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Let me put on a show

I need you like a baby when I hold you
Like a druggy, like I told you
Yayo
Yeah, you
Yayo

Put me onto your black motorcycle
50s' baby doll dress for my "I do"
It only takes two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama

Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Let me put on a show

Hello, heaven, you are a tunnel-lined
With yellow lights on a dark night
Yayo
Yes, you
Yayo

Put me onto your black motorcycle
50s' baby doll dress for my "I do"
It only takes two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle, you call me your mama

Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Let me put on a show

"Bel Air"

Gargoyles standing at the front of your gate
Trying to tell me to wait, but I can't wait to see you
So I run like I'm mad to heaven's door
I don't wanna be bad, I won't cheat you no more

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see, late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

Spotlight, bad baby, you've got a flair
For the violentest kind of love anywhere out there
Mon amour, sweet child of mine, you're divine
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's okay to shine?

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see, late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

Don't be afraid of me
Don't be ashamed
Walk in the way of my soft resurrection
Idol of roses, iconic soul
I know your name
Lead me to war with your brilliant direction

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see, late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Grenadine, sunshineâcan you break this heart of mine?
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby

"Burning Desire"

Every Saturday night, I get dressed up to ride for you, baby
Cruising down the street on Hollywood and Vine for you, baby
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care
You ask me where I've been; I been everywhere
But I don't want to be nowhere but here
(Come on, tell me, boy)

I've got a burning desire for you, baby

Every Saturday night I seem to come alive for you, baby
Santa Monica, I'm racing in the lights for you, baby
I drive fast, radio blares
Have to touch myself to pretend you're there
Your hands were on my hips, your name was on my lips
Over, over again like my only prayer
(Come on, tell me, boy)

I've got a burning desire for you, baby
(I've got a burning desire) (Come on, tell me, boy)
I've got a burning desire for you, baby

"Ultraviolence"

He used to call me DN
That stood for Deadly Nightshade
'Cause I was filled with poison
But blessed with beauty and rage
Jim told me that, he hit me and it felt like a kiss
Jim brought me back, reminded me of when we were kids

With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence

He used to call me poison
Like I was Poison Ivy
I could have died right there
'Cause he was right beside me
Jim raised me up, he hurt me but it felt like true love
Jim taught me that, loving him was never enough

With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence

We could go back to New York
Loving you was really hard
We could go back to Woodstock
Where they don't know who we are
Heaven is on Earth
I would do anything for you, baby
Blessed is this union
Crying tears of gold like lemonade

I love you the first time, I love you the last time
Yo soy la princesa, comprende mis white lines
'Cause I'm your jazz singer and you're my cult leader
I love you forever, I love you forever

With his ultraviolence (Lay me down tonight)
Ultraviolence (In my linen and curls)
Ultraviolence (Lay me down tonight)
Ultraviolence (Riviera Girls)
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence

"Shades Of Cool"

My baby lives in shades of blue
Blue eyes and jazz and attitude
He lives in California, too
He drives a Chevy Malibu
And when he calls, he calls for me and not for you
He lives for love, he loves his drugs, he loves his baby, too

But I can't fix him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather

But you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

My baby lives in shades of cool
Cold heart and hands and aptitude
He lives for love, for women, too
I'm one of many, Bonnie's blue
And when he calls, he calls for me and not for you
He prays for love, he prays for peace, and maybe someone new

But I can't help him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather

'Cause you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

Your hot, hot weather in the summer
High, high, neglectful lover
Hot, hot weather in the summer
High, neglectful lover
You're crumbling, sadly
You're sadly, crumbling

You are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

Pa pa da pa
Pa pa da ah, oh
Oh, oh
Oh

Pa-da-da-da-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da

They say I'm too young to love you
I don't know what I need
They think I don't understand
The freedom land of the seventies
I think I'm too cool to know ya
You say I'm like the ice I freeze
I'm churning out novels like
Beat poetry on amphetamines

I say
I say

Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da
Pa-da-da-da-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da

They say I'm too young to love you
They say I'm too dumb to see
They judge me like a picture book
By the colors, like they forgot to read
I think we're like fire and water
I think we're like the wind and sea
You're burning up, I'm cooling down
You're up, I'm down
You're blind, I see

But I'm free
I'm free

Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

I'm talking about my generation
Talking about that newer nation
And if you don't like it
You can beat it
Beat it, baby
You never liked the way I said it
If you don't get it, then forget it
'Cause I don't have to fucking explain it

And my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get high on hydroponic weed
And my jazz collection's rare
I get down to Beat poetry
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby

Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-de-da
Te-de-de, da-da-ah
Ooh, oh

"West Coast"

Down on the West coast, they got a saying
"If you're not drinking, then you're not playing"
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West coast, I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment, you for the moment
Boy Blue, yeah, you

You're falling hard, I push away, I'm feeling hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much
But something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive, I'm a lush
Your love, your love, my love

I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y cubano como yo, la-la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love (I'm in love)

(Mic-check)
(One, two)
(Two, two)
(Get it, girl)

Down on the West coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West coast, they love their movies
Their golden gods and Rock 'n' Roll groupies
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?

You push it hard, I pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher
Te deseo, cariÃ±o, boy, it's you I desire
Your love, your love, my love

I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love

"Pretty When You Cry"

All the pretty stars shine for you, my love
Am I that girl that you dream of?
All those little times you said that I'm your girl
You make me feel like your whole world

I'll wait for you, babe
That's all I do, babe
Don't come through, babe
You never do

Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry

All those special times I spent with you, my love
They don't mean shit compared to all your drugs
But I don't really mind, I've got much more than that
Like my memories, I don't need that

I wait for you, babe
You don't come through, babe
You never do, babe
That's just what you do

Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry

Don't say you need me when
You leave and you leave again
I'm stronger than all my men
Except for you
Don't say you need me if
You know that you're leaving
I can't do it, I can't do it
But you do it well

'Cause I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry

"Money Power Glory"

You say that you wanna go
To a land that's far away
How are we supposed to get there
With the way that we're living today?
You talk lots about God
Freedom comes from the call
But that's not what this bitch wants
Not what I want at all

I want money, power and glory
I want money and all your power, all your glory
Hallelujah, I wanna take you for all that you got
Hallelujah, I'm gonna take them for all that they got

Baby

The sun also rises on those who fail the call
My life, it comprises of losses and wins and fails and falls
But I can do it if you really, really like that
I know what you really want, b-baby
I can do it if you think you'll like that
You should run, boy, run

I want money, power and glory
I want money and all your power, all your glory
Hallelujah, I wanna take you for all that you got
Hallelujah, I'm gonna take them for all that they got

Baby, baby

Dope and diamonds
Dope and diamonds
Diamonds
Dope and diamonds
Dope and diamonds
That's all that I am
Dope and diamonds
Dope and diamonds
Diamonds
Dope and diamonds
Dope and diamonds
Diamonds

I want money, power and glory
I want money and all your power, all your glory
Hallelujah, I wanna take you for all that you got
Hallelujah, I'm gonna take them for all that they got

"Fucked My Way Up To The Top"

Life is awesome, I confess
What I do, I do best
You got nothing, I got tested
And I passed, yes

Lay me down tonight in my linen and curls
Lay me down tonight, Riviera girls

I fucked my way up to the top
This is my show
I fucked my way up to the top
Go, baby, go
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show

I'm a dragon, you're a whore
Don't even know what you're good for
Mimicking me's a fucking bore
To me, but babe

Lay me down tonight in my diamonds and pearls
Tell me songs at night 'bout your favorite girl

I fucked my way up to the top
This is my show
I fucked my way up to the top
Go, baby, go
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show
Go, go, go, go, go
This is my show

Need you, baby, like I breathe you, baby
Need you, baby, more, more, more, more
Need you, baby, like I breathe you, baby
Fucking need you, baby, more, more, more, more

Lay me down tonight in my linen and curls
Lay me down tonight, I'm your favorite girl

I fucked my way up to the top

"Old Money"

Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne, and white sunshine
Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine
The kids were young and pretty

Where have you been? Where did you go?
Those summer nights seem long ago
And so is the girl you used to call
The Queen of New York City

But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come

The power of youth is on my mind
Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time
Will you still love me when I shine
From words but not from beauty?

My father's love was always strong
My mother's glamour lives on and on
Yet still inside, I felt alone
For reasons unknown to me

But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come

And if you call, I'll run, run, run
If you change your mind, I'll come, come, come

Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne, and hot sunshine
Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine
And we were young and pretty

"The Other Woman"

The other woman has time to manicure her nails
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair anywhere

The other woman enchants her clothes with French perfume
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
And there are never toys that's scattered everywhere

And when her old man comes to call
He finds her waiting like a lonesome queen
'Cause to be by her side
It's such a change from old routine
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

The other woman will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by, the other woman will spend her life alone
Alone

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby, do, do
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, oh
Oh, oh
Alone

"Black Beauty"

I paint my nails black
I dye my hair a darker shade of brown
'Cause you like your women Spanish
Dark, strong and proud
I paint the sky black
You said if you could have your way
You'd make it nighttime all today
So it'd suit the mood of your soul

Oh, what can I do?
Nothing, my sparrow blue
Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

Black beauty, oh oh oh
Black beauty, oh oh oh

I paint the house black
My wedding dress black leather too
You have no room for light
Love is lost on you
I keep my lips red
To seem like cherries in the spring
Darling, you can't let everything
Seem so dark blue

Oh, what can I do?
To turn you on or get through you
Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

Black beauty, oh oh oh
Black beauty, oh oh oh

Black beauty, ah ah
Black beauty, ah ah
Black beauty, ah ah ah ah
Black beauty, baby
Black beauty, baby

Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you

Black beauty, oh oh oh
Black beauty, oh oh oh
Black beauty, oh oh oh
Black beauty, oh oh oh

"Guns And Roses"

Heavy metal love of mine
I should have learned to let you stay
You didn't want me all the time
But you were worth it anyway

'Cause you were so much better
Than the rest of them
Out of all the others
You were the honest man

He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns
And roses, roses, roses

Motorcycle love divine
I should have learned to let you play
I wasn't the marrying kind
I should have done it anyway

We should have left Las Vegas
And then began again
Took your bike to Detroit
Back to the promised land

He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns
And roses, roses, roses

I can feel it coming in the air tonight
See you walking on that blue Pacific
I can see you bathing in the summer light
Turning tan and you look terrific
You got game boy, game boy
You got game boy, game boy
You got game boy, game boy
You got game

He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns
And roses, roses, roses
He loved guns and roses (Oh)
Guns and roses (Oh)
He loved guns and roses (Oh)
He loved guns (Oh)
And roses (Roses), roses (Roses), roses
(Roses)

Roses, roses, roses

"Florida Kilos"

White lines, pretty baby, tattoos
Don't know what they mean
They're special, just for you
White lines, baking powder on the stove
Cooking up a dream, turning diamonds into snow

I feel you, pretty baby, feel me
Turn it up hot, loving you is free
I like it down, like it down way low
But you already know that
You already know
(Fuck!)

Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime
Chic-a-Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side

Yayo, yayo, yayo
And all the dope fiends
Yayo, yayo, yayo
(Fuck!)

Sun in my mouth and gold hoops
You like your little baby like you like your drinks, cool
White lines, pretty daddy, go skiing
You snort it like a champ, like the winter we're not in
(Fuck!)

Come on down to Florida
I got something for ya
We could see the kilos or the Keys, baby, oh yeah
Guns in the summertime
Chic-a-Cherry Cola lime
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my side

Yayo, yayo, yayo

Yayo, yayo, yayo

We could get high in Miami
Ooh, ooh
Dance the night away
People never die in Miami
Ooh, ooh
That's what they all say (Yay)

(You believe me, don't you baby?)

Come on down to Florida

Mm-mm, pretty baby
White lines, pretty baby
Gold teeth, pretty baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Dance the night away

"Is This Happiness"

High up in the Hollywood Hills taking violet pills
Writing all of my songs about my cheap thrills
You're a hard man to love and I'm
A hard woman to keep track of
You like to rage, don't do that
You want your way, you make me so mad
Got your gun, I've got my dad

Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?

High up in the Hollywood Hills crushing violet pills
You've been trying to write a novel about your cheap thrills
You think you're Hunter S. Thompson
I think you're fucking crazy as the day's long
Man to man, heart to heart
I love you but you drive me so far
Wish you well on that star

Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?

Witch Hazel, Witch Hazel
Betrayal, betrayal
One gun on the table
Headshot if you're able

Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?
Is this happiness?

"Flipside"

Are you gonna hurt me now?
Or are you gonna hurt me later?
Are you gonna go to town?
Maybe you should play it safer

You've got me all dressed up tonight
Springsteen on the radio
You've got me all freaked out tonight
Something you're telling me, what? I don't know

You don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry, but
You caught me once
Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again

Drinks on the patio

Are you gonna tell me now?
Are you gonna tell me later?
'Cause if you think that I don't know
I'm gonna have to say you're crazy

I'm getting all dressed up tonight
Dressed up just to hear you, boy
I already know what you got in store
Why I go? Baby, I don't know

'Cause you don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry, but
You caught me once
Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
Maybe on the flipside I could catch me again

So you think you're in charge?
Do you?
Acting like a big shot
I'm sure
So you think you're in charge?
Do you?
You're acting like a big shot

You don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry but
You caught me once
Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again

"West Coast (Radio Mix)"

Down on the West Coast, they got a saying
"If you're not drinking, then you're not playing"
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West Coast, I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the music, you for the music
It's true, it's true

I push it hard, you pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I'm feeling like there's no one else, brings me higher and higher
Te deseo, cariÃ±o, boy it's you I desire
Your love, your love, your love

I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love (I'm in love, I'm in love)

Down on the West Coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?

You pull me close, I push away... I'm feeling hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much
But something keeps me really quiet
I'm alive, I'm a lush
Hold me close you say, hush baby hush

I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love

"Honeymoon"

We both know that it's not fashionable to love me
But you don't go 'cause, truly, there's nobody for you but me
We could cruise to the blues
Wilshire Boulevard, if we choose
Or whatever you wanna do
We make the rules

Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon

Say you want me too
Say you want me too
Dark blue
Dark blue

We both know the history of violence that surrounds you
But I'm not scared, there's nothing to lose now that I've found you
And we could cruise to the news
Pico Boulevard in your used
Little bullet car if we choose

Mr. Born-To-Lose

Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon

Say you want me too
Say you want me too
Dark blue
Dark blue

There are violets in your eyes
There are guns that blaze around you
There are roses in between my thighs and fire that surrounds you
It's no wonder every man in town had neither fought nor found you

Everything you do is elusive, too, even your honey dew

Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon

Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life

Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life

"Music To Watch Boys To"

(I like you a lot)
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys

Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys

"Terrence Loves You"

You are what you are
I don't matter to anyone
But Hollywood legends
Will never grow old
And all of what's hidden
Well, it will never grow cold

But I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got those blues
And I lost myself when I lost you
And I still get trashed, darling, when I hear your tunes

But you are who you are
I won't change you for anything
For when you are crazy
I'll let you be bad
I'll never dare change thee
To what you are not

But I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got those blues
I lost myself and I lost you too
And I still get trashed, baby, when I hear your tunes

I put the radio on, hold you tight in my mind
Isn't strange that you're not here with me
I'm putting all the lights on and the television
Trying to transmit, can you hear me?
Ground control to Major Tom
Can you hear me all night long?
Ground control to Major Tom

Well, I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got the blues
I lost myself and I lost you too
And I still get trashed, honey, when I hear your tunes

"God Knows I Tried"

Sometimes, I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow skies
It's so crazy, I could drink it like tequila sunrise

Put on that Hotel California
Dance around like I'm insane
I feel free when I see no one
And nobody knows my name

God knows I lived, God knows I died
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried
God knows I loved, God knows I lied
God knows I lost, God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried, God knows I tried

Sometimes, I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow lights
On Monday they destroy me
But by Friday I'm revived

Put on that Hotel California
Wear my blinders in the rain
I've got nothing much to live for
Ever since I found my fame

God knows I lived, God knows I died
God knows I loved, God knows I lied
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried
God knows I lost, God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried, God knows I tried

So let there be light
Let there be light
Light up my life, light up my life
Let there be light, let there be light
Light up my life, light up my life

And God knows I tried, God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried
God knows I tried, God knows I tried

"High By The Beach"

High-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh

Boy, look at you, looking at me
I know you know how I feel
Loving you is hard, being here's harder
You take the wheel
I don't wanna do this anymore
It's so surreal
I can't survive
If this is all that's real

All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by, baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye bye

Boy, look at you, looking at me
I know you don't understand
You could be a bad motherfucker
But that don't make you a man
Now you're just another one of my problems
Because you got out of hand
We won't survive
We're sinking into the sand

All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye bye

Lights, camera, acciÃ³n
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want
Lights, camera, acciÃ³n
I'll do it on my own
Don't need your money, money
To get me what I want

All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye bye

High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh

Anyone can start again
Not through love, but through revenge
Through the fire, we're born again
Peace by vengeance, brings the end
(High-igh-igh-igh)

"Freak"

Flames so hot that they turn blue
Palms reflecting in your eyes, like an endless summer
That's the way I feel for you
If time stood still, I'd take this moment, make it last forever

Your halo's full of fire
I'm rising up, rising up
My hot love's full of fire
Love's full of fire
La, ah

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

Leather black and eyes of blue (blue, blue, blue)
Sun reflecting in your eyes, like an easy rider
Life makes sense when I'm with you
Looking back, my past
It all seems stranger than a stranger

So let's dance in slow motion
Tear it up, tear it up
Let's dance by the ocean
Ah, ah

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

Ooh-ooh
You're cold as ice, baby
But when you're nice, baby
You're so amazing in every way
Ooh-ooh
You're cold as ice, baby
I don't wanna fight, baby
It's like I told you
If you stay, I'll stay (yeah)

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
(Take it to the back if you really wanna talk)
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
(Take it to the back if you really wanna talk)
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

"Art Deco"

Club queen on the downtown scene
Prowling around at night
You're not mean, you're just born to be seen
Born to be wild
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
You want in but you just can't win
So you hang in the lights

You're so Art Deco, out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them

'Cause you want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
'Cause you want more

Young thing on the downtown scene
Rolling around at night
Got things that have yet to be seen
Like your rapper's delight
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
You want in, but you just can't win
So you stay in the lights

You're so Art Deco, out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them

'Cause you want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
'Cause you want more

A little party never hurt no one
So we stay out late
A little party never hurt no one
That's what your friends say
You put your life out on the line
You're crazy all the time
Put your life out on the line
You're crazy all the time

You're so Art Deco, out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them

'Cause you want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
You want more (Why?)
'Cause you want more

A little party never hurt no one
Not you and me
A little party never hurt no one
We were born to be free

"Burnt Norton (Interlude)"

Time present and time past
Are both perhaps present in time future
And time future contained in time past
If all time is eternally present
All time is unredeemable
What might have been is an abstraction
Remaining a perpetual possibility
Only in a world of speculation
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present
Footfalls echo in the memory
Down the passage which we did not take
Towards the door we never opened
Into the rose-garden

"Religion"

Everything is fine now
Let sleeping dogs lay
All our minds made up now
All our beds are made
No one's out of time, no
Chips fall wherever they may
Leave it all behind
Let the ocean wash away

It never was about the money or the drugs
For you, there's only love
For you, there's only love
It never was about the party or the clubs
For you, there's only love

'Cause you're my religion, you're how I'm living
When all my friends say I should take some space
Well, I can't envision that for a minute
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray

Hallelujah, I need your love
Hallelujah, I need your love

Everything is bright now
No more cloudy days
Even when the storms come
In thee, I will stay
No need to survive now
All we do is play
All I hear is music
Like Lay Lady Lay

It never was about the money or the drugs
With you, there's only love
With you, there's only love
It never was about the party or the clubs
For you, there's only love

'Cause you're my religion, you're how I'm living
When all my friends say I should take some space
Well, I can't envision that for a minute
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray

Hallelujah, I need your love
Hallelujah, I need your love

You're my religion, you're how I'm living
When all my friends say I should take some space
Well, I can't envision that for a minute
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray

Hallelujah, I need your love
Hallelujah, I need your love

"Salvatore"

All the lights in Miami begin to gleam
Ruby, blue and green, neon too
Everything looks better from above, my king
Like aquamarine, ocean's blue

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Cacciatore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Limousines
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ciao, amore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Soft ice cream

All the lights are sparkling for you it seems
On the downtown scenes, shady blue
Beatboxing and rapping in the summer rain
Like a boss, you sang jazz and blues

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Cacciatore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Limousines
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ciao, amore
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Soft ice creams

The summer's wild and I've been waiting for you all this time
I adore you, can't you see you're meant for me?
The summer's hot but I've been cold without you
I was so wrong not to doubt your MedellÃ­n, tangerine dreams

Catch me if you can, working on my tan
Salvatore
Dying by the hand of a foreign man happily
Calling out my name in the summer rain
Ciao, amore
Salvatore can wait
Now it's time to eat soft ice cream

Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Cacciatore
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Limousines
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ciao amore
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Soft ice cream

"The Blackest Day"

Carry me home, got my blue nail polish on
It's my favorite color and my favorite tone of song
"I don't really wanna break up, we got it going on"
It's what you gathered from my talk, but you were wrong

It's not easy for me to talk about
I have heavy heartstrings
I'm not simple, it's trigonometry
It's hard to express
I can't explain

Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day
It's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

Because I'm going deeper and deeper (Deeper)
Harder and harder (Harder)
Getting darker and darker
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh, my God
In all the wrong places
Oh, my God

Carry me home, got my new coat and my gun
Wind in my hair, holding your hand, listening to our song
Carry me home, don't wanna talk about the things to come
Just put your hands up in the air, the radio on

'Cause there's nothing for us to talk about
Like the future and those things
'Cause there's nothing for me to think about
Now that he's gone, I can't feel nothing

Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day
It's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

Because I'm going deeper and deeper (Deeper)
Harder and harder (Harder)
Getting darker and darker
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh, my God
In all the wrong places
Oh, my God

You should've known better
Than to have, to let her
Get you under her spell of the weather
I got you where I want you
You're deader than ever
And falling for forever
I'm playing head games with you
Got you where I want you
I got you, I got you
I got you where I want you now

Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day
It's been the blackest day
And all I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play

It's not one of those phases I'm going through
Or just a song, it's not one of them
I'm on my own
On my own
On my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again

"24"

There's only 24 hours in a day
And half as many ways for you to lie to me, my little love
There's only 24 hours in a day
And half of those, you lay awake
With thoughts of murder and carnage

If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the company you keep

There's only 24 hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie
Or love like you love

There's only 24 hours in a day
And half of those you lay
Between the sheets with me, my lying love
There's only 24 hours, so you'd say
For most of them you pay
For all the things they paid you for, my love

If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the ones you choose to leave

There's only 24 hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie
Or love like you love

Give me your heat
Give me your diamonds
You hit that street
And my crooked words
You count to three
While they're all dying
You're hard to reach
You're cold to touch

"Swan Song"

Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Why work so hard when you could just be free?
You got your money now, you got your legacy
Let's leave the world for the ones who change everything

Nothing could stop
The two of us
Let's just get lost
That's what we want

And I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
I will never sing again
With just one wave, it goes away
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan song

Dive in, dive deep and dive blue, my sweet
Rushing up from the water where the ice meets
And you've been gone so long, you missed everything
The world can change in a day if you go away

But nothing could stop
The two of us
If that's what we want
We could just get lost

And I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
I will never sing again
With just one wave, it goes away
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan song

Do you like?
Do you like where you've been and where you're going to?
(Going to)
Say goodnight
Say goodnight to the life and the world you knew
I'm gonna follow you

And I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
And I will never sing again
You won't work another day
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan song

Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Why you work so hard when you could just be free?

"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"

Baby, you understand me now?
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood

You know sometimes, baby, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes, again, it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood

If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never meant to take it out on all you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do

'Cause I love you
Oh baby, I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?
Sometimes I find myself alone, regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done

'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood

"Love"

Look at you, kids, with your vintage music
Coming through satellites while cruising
You're part of the past, but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusing

It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes it's enough just to make you feel crazy

You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter 'cause it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah

Look at you, kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues, but
That don't mean that you should abuse it

Though it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
I know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy

But you get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
It don't matter because it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah

Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby

And it's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy
It's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy

I get ready, I get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
It doesn't matter if I'm not enough
For the future or the things to come
'Cause I'm young and in love, ah, ah
I'm young and in love, ah, ah, ah, ah

Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby
Hmm (Ah, ah)
Hmm (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Hmm
Don't worry, baby

"Lust For Life"
(feat. The Weeknd)

Climb up the H of the Hollywood sign (Yeah)
In these stolen moments, the world is mine (Doo-wop, doo-wop)
There's nobody here, just us together (Sha-doop, sha-doop)
Keeping me hot like July forever
'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
There's no way for us to come late
'Cause boy, we're gold, boy, we're gold
And I was like

Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all of your clothes
They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight (Yeah)

And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive

(Then) We dance on the H of the Hollywood sign (Yeah)
'Til we run out of breath, gotta dance 'til we die (Doo-wop, doo-wop)
My boyfriend's back and he's cooler than ever (Sha-doop, sha-doop)
There's no more night, blue skies forever
'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
So there's no need for us to hesitate
We're all alone, let's take control
And I was like

Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all of your clothes
They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight (Yeah)

And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive (Oh)

My boyfriend's back and he's cooler than ever
There's no more night, blue skies forever
I told you twice in our love letter
There's no stopping now, green lights forever
And I was like

Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all of your clothes

And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive (Oh)

"13 Beaches"

I don't belong in the world
That's what it is
Something separates me from other people
Everywhere I turn
There's something blocking my escape

It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally it's mine
With dripping peaches
I'm camera ready
Almost all the time

But I still get lonely
And baby only then
Do I let myself recline?
Can I let go?
And let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

It hurts to love you
But I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying
If I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dying
For something real
That I've been dying
For something real

It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally I'm fine
Past Ventura
And lenses plenty
In the white sunshine

But you still can find me
If you ask nicely
Underneath the pines
With the daisies
Feeling hazy
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

It hurts to love you
But I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying
If I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dying
For something real
That I've been dying
For something real

It hurts to love you
But I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying
If I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
The fact that I can't deal

"Cherry"

Love (Yeah), I said real love is like feeling no fear
When you're standing in the face of danger (Hey)
'Cause you just want it so much
A touch (Yeah) from your real love
Is like heaven taking the place of something evil (Hey)
And letting it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah (Fuck)

Darling, darling, darling
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces
My cherries (Hey) and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined

Love (Yeah), is it real love?
It's like smiling when the firing squad's against ya (Hey)
And you just stay lined up, yeah (Fuck)

Darling, darling, darling
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces (Bitch)
My cherries (Hey) and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches (Can I get a fucking hallelujah?)
Are ruined (Bitch) (Looking at me like a magazine)

My rose garden dreams (Can I get a fucking hallelujah?)
Set on fire by fiends (Sipping on ya like a Coca-Cola)
And all my black beaches (Can I get a fucking hallelujah?)
Are ruined (Looking at me like a magazine)
My celluloid scenes (Can I get a fucking hallelujah?)
Are torn at the seams (Sipping on ya like a Coca-Cola, yeah)
And I fall to pieces (Bitch)
(Yeah) I fall to pieces when I'm with you

(Why?) 'Cause I love you so much (Hey)
I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme (Yeah)
And all of my peaches are ruined (Bitch)
Are ruined (Bitch), are ruined (Fuck)

"White Mustang"

Packing all my things for the summer
Lying on my bed, it's a bummer
'Cause I didn't call when I got your number
But I liked you a lot
Slipping on my dress in soft filters
Everybody said you're a killer
But I couldn't stop the way I was feeling
The day your record dropped

The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang

Caught up in my dreams and forgetting
I've been acting like Armageddon 'cause you
Held me in your arms just a little too tight
That's what I thought
Summer's meant for loving and leaving
I was such a fool for believing that you
Could change all the ways you've been living
But you just couldn't stop

The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang

You're revving and revving and revving it up
And the sound, it was frightening
And you were getting a part of that
You're gonna hit me like lightning

White Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Said, you're a wild mustang

You're gonna hit me like lightning
You're gonna hit me like lightning

"Summer Bummer"
(feat. Playboi Carti & A$AP Rocky)

It's never too late
To be who you wanna be
(Swimming in my safe)
To say what you wanna say
(Tattoo on my face), (Swimming in my safe)
(Tattoo on my face), (Swimming in my safe)
And it's never too late
To leave if you wanna leave (Better not)
Or to stay if you wanna stay
But, baby (Yeah)
I got a feeling in my bones
(Tattoo on my face), (Swimming in my safe)
Can't get you out of my veins (Yeah, yeah)
You can't escape my affection (Yeah, yeah)
Wrap you up in my daisy chains (What? What? What? What?)

Hip-hop in the summer (What? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (What? What? Yeah?)
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer (Summer, what? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (Summer, what? What? What?)
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm (What? What? What? What? What?)

Uh, her sophistication makes you wanna quit the bitch you dating
Let's skip the games, let's quit the playing
Boo, let's get acquainted (What?)
Notifications sync in place even when we're on vacation (Yeah)
I knew she'd notice like I missed the payment, dang it (What? Ooh)
But bang it like my fingers (Ooh, what?)
She pray to God I made it (What?)
But banking like my Franklins (Yeah)
My neighbors stopped the hating (Yeah)
What? (What? They been at it, check it out)
Huh? (We been out here, yeah)
Slide inside it (What?)
Diddy Bopping (What?)
Milly Rocking (What? What?)
She just might become my lover for real (Yeah that's girl; For real, for real)
I might fuck with her all summer for real (For real, for real)
They better not holla if I cuff her for real (For real, for real)
Niggas better run for cover for real
Going bell how I feel, close the deal, pop a seal
Take the whip, two pills on the lips on the real (For real, for real)
Truthfully, between you and me, I'm usually single
When it's hot outside this, I ride through any hood with the top out
Hop out

Hip-hop in the summer (What? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (What? What? Yeah?)
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer (Summer, what? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (Summer, what? What? What?)
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm (What? What? What? What? What?)

White lies and black beaches
Miles in between us
Is this love or lust or some game on repeat?
It's like making me crazy
Tell me, "have patience"
Baby, I need this
White lines and black beaches
White lies and black beaches
And blood red sangrias
We traveled for weeks, just to escape your demons
But you've got your reasons
In making me crazy
But you've got your reasons
White lights and black beaches

High tops in the summer (Top out, hop out, hop out)
Don't be a bummer, babe (Top out, hop out, hop out)
Don't be a bummer (Top out, hop out, hop out)
Don't be a bummer (Babe)

Hip-hop in the summer (What? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (What? What? Yeah?)
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer (Summer, what? What? What?)
Don't be a bummer, babe (Summer, what? What? What?)
Be my undercover lover, babe (What? What? What? What? What?)

Don't be a bummer, babe
Ooh oh, ooh oh
Ooh oh, ooh oh

"Groupie Love"
(feat. A$AP Rocky)

You're in the bar, playing guitar
I'm trying not to let the crowd next to me
It's so hard sometimes with a star
When you have to share him with everybody
You're in the club, living it up
I'm trying not to let the crowd notice me
It's so sweet, swinging to the beat
When I know that you're doing it all for me

And every time you look up
I know what you're thinking of
I know what you're thinking of

You want my
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love

Time after time, writing my lines
Having my baby there next to me
It's so sweet, pouring you a drink
And pretending that nothing means anything
This is my life, you by my side
Key lime and perfume and festivals
Taking our dreams, turning them to things
It's like magic, babe, isn't life wonderful?

And every time we hook up
I know what you're thinking of
I know what you're thinking of

You want my
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love

Front row, every show like a hype man
Sing along, word for word, watching my bae
Side stage, fans screaming causing migraines
Yamborghini-high, but she ain't on my grade
God dang, got a nigga acting irate
My babe, my babe, stay on my brain
My babe, made me sing to a fire escape
City girl, but she grew up in the tri-state
She ain't got no time for no groupie love
We don't pay no minds to the thug with a-
Love girls, you and I, so who do we trust?
You and I 'til the day we die

Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
You are my babe
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love

"In My Feelings"

I'm smoking while I'm running on my treadmill
But I'm coming up roses
Could it be that I fell for another loser?
I'm crying while I'm cumming
Making love while I'm making good money
Sobbing in my cup of coffee
'Cause I fell for another loser

Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wasting my time
While you're taking what's mine with the things that you're doing
Talk that talk, well, now they all know your name
And there's no coming back from the place that you came
Baby, don't do it

'Cause you got me in my feelings
(Got me feeling so much right now)
Talking in my sleep again
(I'm making no sense at all)
Talking while I'm screaming
(Got me feeling so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feeling all my fucking feelings

I'm smoking while I'm running
This town and you better believe it, honey
I'm laughing as I'm taking no prisoners
And taking down names
I'm crying while I'm gunning
In the smoke they can hear me coming
If you were me, and I was you
I'd get out of my way

Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wasting my time while you're taking what's mine
Well, you know what you're doing
Talk that talk, well, now they all know your name
And there's no coming back from the place that you came
Baby, don't do it

'Cause you got me in my feelings
(Got me feeling so much right now)
Talking in my sleep again
(I'm making no sense at all)
Talking while I'm screaming
(Got me feeling so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feeling all my fucking feelings

Got me up in this place right now
Making no sense at all
Got me up in this place right now, against the wall
Got me feeling so blue
Making no sense at all
Gotta leave right now

'Cause you got me in my feelings
(Got me feeling so much right now)
Talking in my sleep again
(I'm making no sense at all)
Talking while I'm screaming
(Got me feeling so crazy right now)
Who's doper than this bitch? Who's freer than me?
You wanna make the switch? Be my guest, baby
I'm feeling all my fucking feelings

"Coachella - Woodstock In My Mind"

I was at Coachella
Leaning on your shoulder
Watching your husband swing in time
I guess I was in it
'Cause baby, for a minute
It was Woodstock in my mind
In the next morning
They put out the warning
Tensions were rising over country lines
I turned off the music
Tried to sit and use it
All of the love that I saw that night

'Cause what about all these children
And what about all their parents
And what about all their crowns they wear
In hair so long like mine
And what about all their wishes
Wrapped up like garland roses
Round their little heads
I said a prayer for a third time

I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven (a stairway, stairway to heaven)
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (a stairway)
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (a stairway)
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question

I was at Coachella
Leaning on your shoulder
Watching your husband swing and shine
I'd say he was hella, cool to win them over
Critics can be so mean sometimes
He was on his knees and I thought he was breaking 'em down with his words and his voice divine
Doesn't take a genius to know what you've got going
And to not wanna lose it 'cause they lost their minds

What about all these children
And all their children's children
And why am I even wondering that today
Maybe my contribution
Could be as small as hoping
That words could turn to birds and birds would send my thoughts your way

I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven (a stairway, stairway to heaven)
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (a stairway)
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (a stairway)
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question

A stairway, stairway to heaven
A stairway
Got a million things I wanna say
Like what is it all for? Will it be okay?
Million things I wanna say
Like what is it all for?
Stairway, stairway to heaven
Stairway
Stairway, stairway to heaven
Stairway

"God Bless America - And All The Beautiful Women In It"

Take me as I am
Take me, baby, in stride
Only you can save me tonight
There's nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
You let me in, don't leave me out
Or leave me dry

Even when I'm alone, I'm not lonely
I hear the sweetest melodies (sweetest melodies)
On the fire escapes of the city
Sounds like I am free
It's got me singing

God bless America
And all the beautiful women in it
God bless America
And all the beautiful women in it, may you
Stand proud and strong
Like Lady Liberty shining all night long
God bless America

Take me as I am
Don't see me for what I'm not
Only you can hear me tonight
Keep your light on, babe
I might be standing outside
You let me in, don't leave me out
Or leave me dry

Even walking alone, I'm not worried
I feel your arms all around me (arms around me)
In the air on the streets of the city
Feels like I am free
It's got me thinking

God bless America
And all the beautiful women in it
God bless America
And all the beautiful women in it, may you
Stand proud and strong
Like Lady Liberty shining all night long
God bless America

(Sweetest melodies)
Even with you I've got no one to lose
So you'd better believe that nobody can make me feel lonely
Because I hear (sweetest melodies)
Even when you talk that talk with the lights on
I still somehow know that I'll never feel, ever feel lonely
I have no fear
It's got me thinking (yeah)

God bless America
And all the beautiful women in it
God bless America
And all the beautiful people in it
May they stand proud and strong
Like Lady Liberty shining all night long
God bless America
And all the beautiful people in it
And all the beautiful people in it

"When The World Was At War We Kept Dancing"

Girls, don't forget your pearls
And all of your horses
As you make your way across the pond
Girls, don't forget your curls
And all of your corsets
Memorize them in a little song

Shake it up
Throw your hands up and get loose
Cut a rug
Lean into the fucking youth
Choreo
We just want the fucking truth
(Told by the fake news)

Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?

No, it's only the beginning
If we hold on to hope
We'll have our happy ending
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancing
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancing

Boys, don't forget your toys
And take all of your money
If you find you're in a foreign land
Boys, don't make too much noise
And don't try to be funny
Other people may not understand

Shake it up
Throw your hands up and get loose
Cut a rug
Lean into the fucking youth
Choreo
We just want the fucking truth
(Told by the fake news)

Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?

No, it's only the beginning
If we hold on to hope
We'll have our happy ending
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancing
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancing

And we'll do it again
Oh my God, dizzy from loving you
And we'll do it again
Oh my God, dizzy from loving you
We'll do it again
(Did it from, did it from loving you)
We'll do it again
In a world at war

Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?

When the world was at war before
We just kept dancing
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancing

And we'll do it again
And we'll do it again

"Beautiful People Beautiful Problems"
(feat. Stevie Nicks)

Blue is the color of the planet from the view above
Long live our reign, long live our love
Green is the planet from the eyes of a turtle dove
'Til it runs red, runs red with blood

We get so tired and we complain
'Bout how it's hard to live
It's more than just a video game

But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
But we gotta try (la la la)
Every day and night (la la la)

Blue is the collar of the shirt of the man I love
He's hard at work, hard to the touch
But warm is the body of the girl from the land he loves
My heart is soft, my past is rough

But when I love him get a feeling
Something close to like a sugar rush
It runs through me
But is it wasted love?
(It's not wasted love)

But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
But we gotta try (la la la)
Every day and night (la la la)

Yeah, we've gotta try (la la la)
We gotta walk through fire (la la la)
Because we're just

Beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
(We're just)
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
(Beautiful people)
Beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
(We're just)
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them

So beautiful
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

"Tomorrow Never Came"
(feat. Sean Lennon)

"Hey, what you doing?" Not a lot
Shaking and moving at my local spot
Baby, don't ask me why, don't ask me why
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why

Lay, lady, lay on that side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay
And I'd be your tiny dancer, honey

I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the middle of the pouring rain
'Cause I adored you
I just wanted things to be the same
You said to meet me up there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came

Hey, what you thinking? Penny for your thoughts
Those lights are blinking on that old jukebox
But don't ask me why, just swallow some wine
Wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wine

Stay, baby, stay on the side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay
And you'd be my tiny dancer, baby

I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the middle of the pouring rain
'Cause I adored you
And I just wanted things to be the same
You said you'd meet me up there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came

Roses out in your country house
We played guitar in your barn
And everyday felt like Sunday
And I, I wish we had stayed home
And I could put on the radio to our favorite song
Lennon and Yoko, we would play all day long
"Isn't life crazy?", I said now that I'm singing with Sean
Whoa

I could keep waiting for you
In the spot we always wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the summer, on the pouring rain
Honey, don't ignore me
I just wanted it to be the same
You said you'd love me like no tomorrow
I guess tomorrow never came (No, no, no)
Tomorrow never came (No, no)
Tomorrow never came (No, no, no)
Tomorrow never came

"Heroin"

Topanga is hot tonight, the city by the bay
Has movie stars and liquor stores and soft decay
The rumbling from distant shores sends me to sleep
But the facts of life, can sometimes make it hard to dream

Life rocked me like MÃ¶tley
Grabbed me by the ribbons in my hair
Life rocked me, ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you wear

I'm flying to the moon again
Dreaming about heroin
How it gave you everything
And took your life away
I put you on an aeroplane
Destined for a foreign land
I hoped that you'd come back again
And tell me everything's
Okay eh, eh, babe, yeah

Topanga is hot today
Manson's in the air
And all my friends have gone
'Cause they still feel him here
I want to leave
I'll probably stay another year
It's hard to leave when absolutely nothing's clear

Life rocked me like MÃ¶tley
Bad beginning to my new year
Life rocked me, ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you hear

I'm flying to the moon again
Dreaming about heroin
And how it gave you everything
And took your life away
I put you on the aeroplane
Destined for a foreign land
I thought that you'd come back again
To tell me everything's
Okay eh, eh, babe, yeah

It's fucking hot, hot
Winter in the city
Something 'bout this weather made these kids go crazy
It's hot, even for February
Something 'bout this sun has made these kids get scary
Oh, writing in blood on my walls and shit
Like
Oh, oh my God
Jumping off from the walls into the docks and shit
Oh, ho ho ho, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sick of it
Lead me baby
Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on

I'm flying to the moon again
Dreaming about marzipan
Taking all my medicine
To take my thoughts away
I'm getting on that aeroplane
Leaving my old man again
I hope that I come back one day
To tell you that I
Really changed
Baby

It's hot, hot
Something 'bout the city
Don't know what it is
It makes my head get crazy
Oh, oh, oh
Makes me feel like I can change
Oh, hoh, hoh, hoh
All of my evil ways and shit
Hmm, hmm
Oh, oh, oh
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sick of it

"Change"

There's something in the wind, I can feel it blowing in
It's coming in softly on the wings of a bomb
There's something in the wind, I can feel it blowing in
It's coming in hotly and it's coming in strong

Lately, I've been thinking it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinking it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to wanna try? But

Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings
Trying to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it coming in me
Maybe by the time summer's done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holding you in my arms without letting you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are, because

Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for it

There's something in the wind, I can feel it blowing in
It's coming in softly on the wings of a song
There's something in the water, I can taste it turning sour
It's bitter, I'm coughing, but now it's in my blood

Lately, I've been thinking it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinking it's just someone else's job to care
'Cause who am I to wanna try? But

Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings
Trying to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it coming in me
Maybe by the time summer's done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holding you in my arms without letting you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are, because

Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for it

Yeah, whenever it does, we'll be here for it
Whenever it does, we'll be here for it

"Get Free"

Finally
I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world
To the reveal of my heart
Undoubtedly
That will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea
And the darkness from the arts

This is my commitment
My modern manifesto
I'm doing it for all of us
Who never got the chance
For... and for... (Shut up, shut up)
And all my birds of paradise (Shut up, shut up)
Who never got to fly at night (Shut up, shut up)
'Cause they were caught up in the dance

Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep riding the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)

Finally
Gone is the burden
Of the Crowley way of being
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was I
Was not discerning
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mind

There's no more chasing rainbows
And hoping for an end to them
Their arches are illusions
Solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them (Touch, touch)
There's nothing to hold on to (Hold, hold)
The colors used to lure you in (Shut up, shut up)
And put you in a trance (Ah, ah, ah, yeah)

Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep riding the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)

"Norman Fucking Rockwell"

Goddamn, man-child
You fucked me so good that I almost said, "I love you"
You're fun and you're wild
But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
But I can't change that, and I can't change your mood
Ah-ah

'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue, blue

Goddamn, man-child
You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
Self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Canyon know-it-all
You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you
But I don't get bored, I just see it through
Why wait for the best when I could have you?
You-oh-oh

'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue

You make me blue
Blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue

"Mariners Apartment Complex"

You took my sadness out of context
At the Mariners Apartment Complex
I ain't no candle in the wind
I'm the board, the lightning, the thunder
Kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
Who you are and who you've been

And who I've been is with you on these beaches
Your Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
Maybe I could save you from your sins
So kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus
My, my, my, you found this, you need this
Take a deep breath, baby, let me in

You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

They mistook my kindness for weakness
I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
Can't a girl just do the best she can?
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Think about it, the darkness, the deepness
All the things that make me who I am

And who I am is a big-time believer
That people can change, but you don't have to leave her
When everyone's talking, you can make a stand
'Cause even in the dark, I feel your resistance
You can see my heart burning in the distance
Baby, baby, baby, I'm your man (Yeah)

You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Take in the sweetness
You want this, you need this
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?

"Venice Bitch"

Fear fun, fear love
Fresh out of fucks forever
Trying to be stronger for you
Ice cream, ice queen
I dream in jeans and leather
Live stream, I'm sweet for you

Oh God, miss you on my lips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Calling out, bang bang, kiss kiss

You're in the yard, I light the fire
And as the summer fades away
Nothing gold can stay
You write, I tour, we make it work
You're beautiful and I'm insane
We're American-made

Give me Hallmark
One dream, one life, one lover
Paint me happy in blue
Norman Rockwell
No hype under our covers
It's just me and you

Oh God, miss you on my lips

Calling out, bang bang, kiss kiss

"Fuck It I Love You"

I like to see everything in neon
Drink lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Maybe the way that I'm living is killing me
I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But one day I woke up like
"Maybe I'll do it differently"

So I moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
It turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It's killing me slowly

Dream a little dream of me
Make me into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do

I used to shoot up my veins in neon
And shit's even brighter; you're gone
So many things I would say to you
I want you

You moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
And you know everyone adores you
You can't feel it and you're tired
Baby, wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
But it's killing me slowly

Dream a little dream of me
Turn this into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do

It turns out California's more than just a state of mind
I met you on the boulevard, braids in my hair, you blew my mind
And if I wasn't so fucked up, I think I'd fuck you all the time
(I really do)
It's killing me slowly

Fuck it, I love you (I moved to California, but it's just a state of mind)
Fuck it, I love you (It turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie)
Fuck it, I love you (Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine)
I really do (It's killing me slowly)

(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreaming, got my money on my mind
(Fuck it, I love you)
Jazz in my veins, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreaming, got my money on my mind
(I really do)
Jazz in my veins, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreaming, got my money on my mind
(Fuck it, I love you)
Jazz in my veins, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreaming, got my money on my mind
(I really do)
Jazz in my veins, running out of time

"Love Song"

In the car, in the car, in the backseat, I'm your baby
We go fast, we go so fast, we don't move
I believe in a place you take me
Make you real proud of your baby
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burning through you
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burning through you

Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lying on your chest in my party dress
I'm a fucking mess, but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, passed the test and yes
Now I'm here with you, and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You know that I'd just die to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song

Dream a dream, here's a scene
Touch me anywhere 'cause I'm your baby
Grab my waist, don't waste any part
I believe that you see me for who I am
So spill my clothes on the floor of your new car
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?

Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lying on your chest in my party dress
I'm a fucking mess, but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, passed the test and yes
Now I'm here with you, and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You know that I'd just die to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song

"Cinnamon Girl"

Cinnamon in my teeth
From your kiss, you're touching me
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
You try to push me out, but I just find my way back in
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out, I win

There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did

Kerosene in my hands
You make me mad, on fire again
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work

There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did

There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

"How To Disappear"

John met me down on the boulevard
Cry on his shoulder 'cause life is hard
The waves came in over my head
What you been up to, my baby?
Haven't seen you 'round here lately
All of the guys tell me lies, but you don't
You just crack another beer
And pretend that you're still here

This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear

Joe met me down at the training yard
Cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard
I know he's in over his head
But I love that man like nobody can
He moves mountains and pounds them to ground again
I watched the guys getting high as they fight
For the things that they hold dear
To forget the things they fear

This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear

Now it's been years since I left New York
I've got a kid and two cats in the yard
The California sun and the movie stars
I watch the skies getting light as I write
As I think about those years
As I whisper in your ear

I'm always going to be right here
No one's going anywhere

"California"

(One, two, three, four)

You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms, baby
You don't ever have to go faster than your fastest pace
Or faster than my fastest cars

I shouldn't have done it, but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to reach out, but I never said a thing
I shouldn't have done it, but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to call you, but I didn't say a thing
(Two, three, four)

Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever how far
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance 'til dawn
I'll pick up all of your Vogues and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top shelf
I'll throw a party all night long

You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms, and, honey
You don't ever have to act cooler than you think you should
You're brighter than the brightest stars

You're scared to win, scared to lose
I've heard the war was over if you really choose
The one in and around you
You hate the heat, you got the blues
Changing like the weather, oh, that's so like you
The Santa Ana moves you
(Two, three, four)

Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever how far
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance 'til dawn
I'll pick up all of your Vogues and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top shelf
I'll throw a party all night long

Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up

"The Next Best American Record"

My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
To the Houses of the Holy, smoking on them cigarettes
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was cool as heck
He was cool as heck

And we were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
That we gave all we had 'til the time we got to bed
'Cause we knew we could
We were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
'Cause we were just that good
It was just that good

Whatever's on tonight, I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight, I'm taking off my bathing suit
You make me feel like
There's something that I never knew I wanted

My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was '70s in spirit, '90s in his frame of mind
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
We lost track of space
We lost track of time

And we were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
That we gave all we had 'til the time we got to bed
'Cause we knew we could
We were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
'Cause we were just that good
It was just that good

Whatever's on tonight, I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight, I'm taking off my bathing suit
You make me feel like
There's something that I never knew I wanted
We play the Eagles down in Malibu and I want it

It's you, all the roads lead to you
Everything I want and do, all the things that I say
It's true, all the roads lead to you
Like the 405 I drive through
Every night and every day
I see you for who you really are
Why the thousands of girls love
The way Bill plays guitar

Whatever's on tonight, I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight, I'm taking off my bathing suit
You make me feel like
There's something that I never knew I wanted
We play the Eagles down in Malibu and I want it
There's something that I never knew I wanted

"The Greatest"

I miss Long Beach and I miss you, babe
I miss dancing with you the most of all
I miss the bar where the Beach Boys would go
Dennis' last stop before Kokomo

Those nights were on fire
We couldn't get higher
We didn't know that we had it all
But nobody warns you before the fall

And I'm wasted
Don't leave, I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess I'm signing off after all

I miss New York and I miss the music
Me and my friends, we miss rock 'n' roll
I want shit to feel just like it used to
When, baby, I was doing nothing the most of all

The culture is lit, and if this is it, I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all

I'm wasted
Don't leave, I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all

If this is it, I'm signing off
Miss doing nothing the most of all
Hawaii just missed that fireball
L.A. is in flames, it's getting hot
Kanye West is blond and gone
"Life on Mars?" ain't just a song
I hope the live stream's almost on

"Bartender"

All the ladies of the canyon
Wearing black to their house parties
Crosby, Stills and Nash is playing
Wine is flowing with Bacardi

But sometimes, girls just want to have fun
The poetry inside of me is warm like a gun

I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo-free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby, remember, I'm not drinking wine
But that Cherry Coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bartender, bar-t-t-tender

All the ladies of the canyon
Wearing white for their tea parties
Playing games of levitation
Meditating in the garden

And I love the little games that we play
From the valley to the beach
And when at last the day is done, I grab my keys

I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo-free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby, remember, I'm not drinking wine
But that Cherry Coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bar-t-t-tender, bar-t-t-tender, bar-t-t-tender
Ha, ha, ha, ha

I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
60 MPH on PCH drive
Here to Long Beach to Newport by your side
As they don't yet know where I reside
60 miles from the last place I hide
With my bar-t-t-tender, hold me all night
Bar-t-t-tender, keep love alive
Bar-t-t-tender

"Happiness Is A Butterfly"

Do you want me or do you not?
I heard one thing, now I'm hearing another
Dropped a pin to my parking spot
The bar was hot, it's 2 AM, it feels like summer

Happiness is a butterfly
Try to catch it, like, every night
It escapes from my hands into moonlight
Every day is a lullaby
Hum it on the phone, like, every night
Sing it for my babies on the tour life, ah

If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt

I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you

Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you (Dance)
Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you

Left the canyon, drove to the club
I was one thing, now I'm being another
Laurel down to Sunset in the truck
I'll pick you up if you're in town on the corner, ah

Happiness is a butterfly
We should catch it while dancing
I lose myself in the music, baby
Every day is a lullaby
Try to catch it like lightning
I sing it into my music, I'm crazy

If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt

I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you

Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you (Dance)
Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you

"Hope Is A Dangerous Thing For A Woman Like Me To Have - But I Have It"

I was reading Slim Aarons
And I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed
If I was tested less like all of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses
And high heels on white yachts
But I'm not
Baby I'm not
No, I'm not
That I'm not

I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7, Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on my walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not
But at best I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing
For a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing
For a woman like me to have

I had fifteen-year dances
Church basement romances yeah I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage which I also call home when I'm not
Serving up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, "Hi dad"

I've been tearing up town in my fucking white gown
Like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's
Got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less and I never cared more
So there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing
For a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing
For a woman with my past

There's a new revolution
A loud evolution
That I saw
Born of confusion
And quiet collusion
Of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman
With a weak constitution
'Cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed
That I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping
The keys on my nights off

I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7, Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on your walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy, they know that I'm not
But at best you can see I'm not sad
But hope is a dangerous thing
For a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing
For a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing
For a woman like me to have
But I have it
Yeah, I have it
Yeah, I have it
I have

"LA Who Am I To Love You"

I left my city for San Francisco
Took a free ride off a billionaire's jet
LA, I'm from nowhere, who am I to love you?
LA, I've got nothing, who am I to love you when I'm feeling this way and I've got nothing to offer?
LA, not quite the city that never sleeps
Not quite the city that wakes, but the city that dreams, for sure
If by dreams, you mean in nightmares

LA, I'm a dreamer, but I'm from nowhere, who am I to dream?
LA, I'm upset, I have complaints, listen to me
They say I came from money and I didn't
And I didn't even have love, and it's unfair
LA, I sold my life rights for a big check and I'm upset
And now I can't sleep at night and I don't know why
Plus, I love Zach, so why did I do that when I know it won't last?

LA, I picked San Francisco because the man who doesn't love me lives there
LA, I'm pathetic, but so are you, can I come home now?
Daughter to no one, table for one
Party of thousands of people I don't know at Delilah where my ex-husband works
I'm sick of this, but can I come home now?
Mother to no one, private jet for one
Back home to the Tudor house that borned a thousand murder plots
Hancock Park, it's treated me very badly, I'm resentful
The witch on the corner, the neighbor nobody wanted
The reason for Garcetti's extra security

LA, I know I'm bad, but I have nowhere else to go, can I come home now?
I never had a mother, will you let me make the sun my own for now, and the ocean my son?
I'm quite good at tending to things despite my upbringing, can I raise your mountains?
I promise to keep them greener, make them my daughters
Teach them about fire, warn them about water
I'm lonely, LA, can I come home now?

I left my city for San Francisco
And I'm writing from the Golden Gate Bridge
But it's not going as I planned
I took a free ride off a billionaire and brought my typewriter
And promised myself that I would stay, but
It's just not going the way that I thought
It's not that I feel different, and I don't mind that it's not hot
It's just that I belong to no one, which means there's only one place for me
The city not quite awake, the city not quite asleep
The city that's still deciding how good it can be

And also
I can't sleep without you
No one's ever really held me like you
Not quite tightly, but certainly, I feel your body next to me
Smoking next to me
Vaping lightly next to me
And I love that you love the neon lights like me
Orange in the distance
We both love that
And I love that we have that in common
Also, neither one of us can go back to New York
For you are unmoving
As for me, it won't be my city again until I'm dead
Fuck the New York Post

LA, who am I to need you when I've needed so much, asked for so much?
And what I've been given, I'm not sure yet
I may never know that either until I'm dead
For now, though, what I do know
Is although I don't deserve you
Not you at your best and your splendor
With towering eucalyptus trees that sway in my dominion
Not you at your worst
Totally on fire, unlivable, unbreathable, I need you

You see, I have no mother
And you do
A continental shelf
A larger piece of land from where you came
And I?
I'm an orphan
A little seashell that rests upon your native shores
One of many, for sure
But because of that, I surely must love you closely to the most of anyone

For that reason, let me love you
Don't mind my desperation
Let me hold you, not just for vacation
But for real and for forever
Make it real life
Let me be a real wife to you
Girlfriend, lover, mother, friend
I adore you
Don't be put off by my quick-wordedness
I'm generally quite quiet
Quite a meditator, actually
I'll do very well down by Paramhansa Yogananda's realization center, I'm sure
I promise you'll barely even notice me
Unless you want to notice me
Unless you prefer a rambunctious child
In which case, I can turn it on too
I'm quite good on the stage as you may know
You might have heard of me

So either way, I'll fit in just fine
So just love me by doing nothing
And perhaps, by not shaking the county line
I'm yours if you'll have me
But regardless, you're mine

"The Land Of 1000 Fires"

Two blue steel trains run through the tunnels of your cool blue steel eyes
Vernon
Rock quarry
The vastness of which has nothing on your beautiful mind
Dylan
I hear Dylan when I look at you
I can see it in invisible ink like a tattoo
The ying to my yang
The toughness to my unending softness
A striking example of masculinity
Firm in your verticality
Sure in your confrontation against all elements
And duality
The sun to my wilting daisy
The earth to the wildflower that doesn't care where it grows

Vernon
Everything's burnt here
There's no escaping it
The air is fried and on fire
I've never really fallen in love
But whatever this feeling is
I wish everyone could experience it
This place feels like a person
Familiar
Like someone I've stood next to before
But never while I was standing next to you
Thank you
For being here
For bearing witness to my vastness

Through the year I've called you in and out of my orbit
You, in your madness
The satellite that constellates my world
Mimicking the inner chaos that I've disowned
A mirror to my past life retributions
And a reflection of my sadness
If I'm going to keep on living the way that I'm living
I can't do it without you
My feet aren't on the ground
I need your body to stand on
Your name to define me
On top of being a woman
I am scared
And
Ethereal
And

There are seven worlds in my eyes

I'm accessing of all them once

One to draw my words from and my muses
Another one I try and harness late at night that lies somewhere
Off of the right of Jupiter
And then of course there's this one I live in
The land of a thousand fires
That's where you come in

You
Vernon
Dylan
Two blue steel trains
Running through the tunnels of your
Cool blue steel eyes

To guide me far from the world of my early days
That I can't quite make out clearly
That beckon me towards high sea cliffs
On long car rides

Towards a future place
A world unknown to me
Made up of something surreal and dripping
Flowers in solar systems oversized

You Vernon Dylan

No words needed to sponge up the
Dark nights
No explanations for the globes in my eyes
Shoulder to shoulder in the factory light
Letting me be who I would have been
If everything had turned out alright

Three alternative endings
Now course through my blood on ice
But I thrive because I say I do
And because it's what I write

But honestly if you weren't here with me
I don't know what things would look like

That's my why no matter what world I'm in
I'm accessible by only one satellite
Vernon
Dylan
And you in your madness

With two blue steel trains running
Through your cool blue steel eyes

"Violet Bent Backwards Over The Grass"

I went to a party
I came in hot
Made decisions beforehand
My mind made up
Things that would make me happy
To do them or not
Each option weighed carefully
A plan for each thought
And then I walked through the door past the open concept
And saw Violet bent backwards over the grass
Seven years old with dandelions grasped tightly in her hand
Arched like a bridge in a fallen handstand
Grinning wildly like a madman
With the exuberance that only doing nothing can bring
Waiting for the fireworks to begin
And in that moment I decided to do nothing about everything

"Past The Bushes Cypress Thriving"

I saw you in the mirror
You were wearing your hair differently
Carrying the air differently
You said you wear your hair long parted in the middle
Long in solidarity just like all his women

In Long Beach

Aimless

Your fingers wiping oil on the paper with precision
With decision like an artist never seen yet with a vision

With a reason
Stared with venom at the ceiling
Not the grass
But straight ahead
Just At the skyline
With precision
Laser vision

Time was stopping
Moving through you
You dictated
By what moved you

Only moving never thinking

Match the sun that's slowly sinking
At the height of the afternoon
In the heat of the summer evening
Like a phoenix like a chem trail like a wavelength No
One's claiming

Georgia o Keefe
Georgia peaches
Doing nothing but your painting
For forever
Forget teachers
Forgive him for ever leaving

Love is rising
No resisting
Cheeks are flushing
Now you're living

Say goodbye now
No resisting
Live your life like
No one's listening

Be the art the life is breathing
Be the soul the world is living

For you only
Not for giving
Just for taking
No one's listening

At the end of Rose and Rich
Down the street that's green and winding
Past the bushes cypress thriving
Past the chain link fence and driving
Further down the road less travelled
There you are athleisure wear unraveled
Now I see you clear

Standing stoic blue and denim
Eyes not blue but clear like
Heaven

You don't want to be forgotten

You just want to disappear

"Salamander"

Get out of my blood, salamander!
I can't seem to blow off enough steam to get you out of my head
Soul cycle you to death, run you out of my blood to San Pedro
And yet, everywhere I go, it seems there you are
And there I am

I don't want to sell my stories anymore, stop pushing me
Some stories aren't meant to be sold
Some words aren't meant to be told

I want to leave them underneath the nightstand to be forgotten
Or remembered should my thoughts come upon them in the middle of the night after a long beach day
Or by you, some afternoon, to thumb through with your worn warm after-work hands
I love you, but you don't understand me, I'm a real poet!
My life is my poetry, my love making is my legacy!
My thoughts are about nothing, and beautiful, and for free

You see, the things that can't be bought can't be evaluated, and that makes them beyond human reach
Untouchable, safe, otherworldly
Unable to be deciphered or metabolized

Something metaphysical
Like a view of the sea on a summer day on the most perfect winding road taken in from the car window

A thing perfect, and ready to become a part of the texture of the fabric of something more ethereal

Like Mount Olympus, where Zeus sent Athena and the rest of the immortals to play

"Never To Heaven"

May my eyes always stay level to the horizon
May they never gaze as high as heaven, to ask why
May I never go where angels fear to tread
So as to have to ask for answers in the sky
The whys in this lifetime I've found are inconsequential
Compared to the magic of the nowness - the solution to most questions
There are no reasons

And if there are - I'm wrong
But at least I won't have spent my life waiting
Looking for God in the clouds of the dawn

I'll be up early to rise though of course
But only to make you a pot of coffee

That's what I was thinking this morning Joe
That it's times like this as the marine layer lifts
Off the sea from the view of our favorite restaurant
That I pray that I may
Always keep my eyes level to your eyeline
Never downcast at the table cloth

You see, Joe
It's times like this that the marine layer lifts
Off the sea on the dock with out candle lit
That I think to myself
There are things you still don't know about me
Like sometimes I'm afraid my sadness is too big
And that one day you might have to help me handle it

But until then
May my eyes always stay level to the skyline
Assessing Long Beach's glittering new development
Never higher than the tallest building
Never to heaven or revenant
'Cause I have faith in man as strange as that seems
In times like these
And it's not just because of the warmth I've found in your
Brown eyes
It's because I believe in the goodness in me
That it's firm enough to plant a flag in
Or a
Rosebud
Or to build a new life

"SportCruiser"

I took a flying lesson on my 33rd birthday, instead of calling you
Or parking on the block where our old place used to be

Genesee, genesee, genesee

Pathetic, I know â but sometimes I still like to park on that street
And have lunch in the car just to feel close to you

I was once in love with my life here
In that studio apartment with you
Little yellow flowers on the tops of trees as our only view
Out of the only window
Big enough for me to see our future through
But it turned out I was the only one who could see it

Stupid apartment complex
Terrible you
You, who I wait for
You, you, you
Like a broken record stuck on loop

So that day, on my birthday, I thought
"Something has to change"
You can't always be about waiting for you

Don't tell anyone, but part of my reasoning for taking the flight class, was this idea that if I could become my own navigator
The captain of the sky
That perhaps I could stop looking for direction
From you

Well, what started off as an idea on a whim
Has turned into something more
Too shy to explain to the owners that my first lesson was just a one-time thing
I've continued to go to classes each week
At the precious little strip off Santa Monica and Bundy

And everything was going fine
We were starting with dips and loops
And then something terrible happened

During my fourth lesson in the sky
My instructor, younger than I, but as tough as you
Instructed me to do a simple maneuver
It's not that I didn't do it
But I was slow to lean the sports cruiser into a right-hand upward turn
Scared, scared that I would lose control of the plane

Not tactfully and not gently
The instructor shook his head, and without looking at me said
"You don't trust yourself"

I was horrified
Feeling as though I'd somehow been found out
Like he knew me
How weak I was
Of course, he was only talking about my ability as a pilot in the sky
But I knew it was meant for me to hear those words

For me, they held a deeper meaning
I didn't trust myself

Not just 2500 feet above the coast of Malibu
But with anything
And I didn't trust you

I could've said something but I was quiet
Because pilots aren't like poets
They don't make metaphors between life and the sky

In the midst of this mid-life, meltdown, navigational exercise in self-examination
I also decided to do something else I had always wanted to do
Take sailing lessons in the vibrant bay of Marina del Rey
I signed up for the class as "Elizabeth Grant"
And nobody blinked an eye

So, why was I so sure that when I walked into the tiny shack on Valley Way, someone would say
"You're not a captain of a ship, or the master of the sky!"
No, the fisherman didn't care, and so neither did I

And for a brief moment, I felt more myself than ever before

Letting the self proclaimed drunkard captain's lessons wash over me like the foamy tops of the sea

Midway through my forehead burned
And my hands raw from driving
The captain told me the most important thing I would need to know on the sea

"Never run the ship into irons"
That's nautical terms for not sailing the boat directly into the wind

In order to do that though, you have to know where the wind is coming from

And you might not have time to look up to the mast
Or up further to the weathervane
So you have to feel where the wind is coming from
On your cheeks, and by the tips of the white waves from which direction they're rolling

To do this, he gave me an exercise
He told me to close my eyes, and asked me to feel on my neck which way the wind was blowing
I already knew I was going to get it wrong
"The wind is coming from everywhere, I feel it all over" I told him
"No", he said, "the wind is coming from the left. The portside"
I sat waiting for him to tell me "You don't trust yourself"

But he didn't, so I said it for him
"I don't trust myself"

He laughed gentler than the pilot, but still not realising that my failure in the exercise was hitting me at a much deeper level

"It's not that you don't trust yourself" he said. "it's simply that you're not a captain. It isn't what you do"

Then he told me he wanted me to practise everyday so I would get better

"Which grocery store do you go to?" he asked
"To the Ralphs in the Palisades" I replied

"OK. When you're in the Ralphs in the Palisades
I want you, as you're walking from your car to the store
To close your eyes, and feel which way the wind is blowing
Now, I don't want you to look like a crazy person crouching in the middle of the parking lot
But everywhere you go
I want you to try and find which way the wind is coming in from
And then, determine if it's from the port or starboard side
So when you're back on the boat you have a better sense of it"

I thought his advice was adorable
I could already picture myself in the parking lot
Squinting my eyes with perfect housewives looking on

I could picture myself growing a better sense of which way the wind was blowing
And as I did, a tiny bit of deeper trust also began to grow within myself
I thought of mentioning it
But I didn't
Because captain's aren't like poets
They don't make metaphors between the sea and the sky

And as I thought that to myself
I realized
That's why I write

All of this circumnavigating the earth
Was to get back to my life
Six trips to the moon for my poetry to arise

I'm not a captain
I'm not a pilot
I write!
I write

"Tessa DiPietro"

No one ever touched me without wanting to kill me
Except for a healer on 6th street in Ridgely
Tessa DiPietro,
Recommended casually by a medium I no longer know

She said my number-one problem was that my field was untrusting
When asked what to do, she paused and said nothing
Which sent me right into uncontrollable sobbing

Because there's never anything you can do about the important things

She said "Okay, one thing you can do is picture the floor rising up to support you,
And sink into the back of the bed that's behind you
Too much of your energy is in front and above you"

Which, for some reason, made me think of a live show I'd seen
Jim Morrison at the Hollywood Bowl, 1968, check date

The blue trellis lights gave him an unusual aura
Like a halo or something
Made him 8 feet or taller

I remember just thinking he looked out of his body
But definitely like a god on stage

So I told her "Maybe an artist has to function a little bit above themselves,
If they really want to transmit some heaven"

And she told me
"A singleness of focus is the key to transmission,
For an emphasis on developing inner intuition,
Close your eyes and feel where you hold your attention

If it's in the back of your eyes
Walk it down to your heart's centre
And make that the new place from which your thoughts enter

Clairvoyance comes mostly from this simple function
Oh - and Jim died at 27
So find another frame of reference
When you're referencing heaven

And have you ever read the lyrics to 'People are Strange'?
He made no sense!"

"Quiet Waiter Blue Forever"

You move like water sweet baby sweet waiter
Making the night smile to no one you cater
Silent wood worker from midnight till later
My lover my laughter my armor my maker
The way that I feel with you is something like aching
Inside of my stomach the cosmos are baking
A universe hung like a mobile
The alignment of these planets unique
In me the earth moves around the sun
No land all sea
Water world
Sun chaser
Tropic of cancer
Southern equater
I'm the crying crustacean
Sunbathing on paper
Moon
Let's rewrite the beginning of this primordial ooze
Shall we my love
Am I being brazen for saying this year makes me feel
Like we could've wrote it better
Than him?
But who am I
Just a girl in love dreaming on paper
Rearranging the salt for the pepper
In love with you
My quiet waiter
Summer
Blue
Forever
Call me when you're done with work
I'll pick you up later
The darker the better

"What Happened When I Left You"

Perfect petals punctuate the fabrics yellow blue
Silver platters with strawberries strewn across the room

In Zimmerman with sandals on one summer dress to choose

Three girls
Eyes rolled
Loud laughter
Dust specs lit by afternoon

My life is sweet like lemonade now there's no bitter fruit
Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
No thought of you

My thoughts have changed
My voice is higher
Now I'm over you

No flickering in my head movies
Projected in Bellevue

Because I captured the mood of my wish fulfilled
And sailed to Xanadu

The grief that came in waves that rolled I navigated through

The fire from my wish as wind to future trip to Malibu

Now everything I have is perfect
Nothing much to do

Just perfect florals
Green embroidered chairs
One dress to choose

"Happy"

You thought I was rich
And I am but not how you think
I live in a Tudor house
Under the freeway in Mar Vista by the beach
When you call I take my phone to the picnic table
That I bought from the Rose Bowl
And I listen to the rushing cars above
And I think about the last time you visited me
The last time we made love
How the noise got louder and louder during rush hour
Until it sounded like the sea
And it felt like the ocean was the sky
And that I was flying because you were two feet taller than me
Until you took me in your arms
And I could touch the stars
And they all fell down around my head
And I became an angel
And you put me to bed
Happy

People think that I'm rich and I am but not how they think
I have a truck with a gold key chain in the ignition
And on the back it says: happy, joyous, and free
Happy
And when I drive
I think about the last time my friends were driving with me
How the radio was so loud that I couldn't hear the words
So we became the music
Happy

They write that I'm rich and I am but not how they think
I have a safe I call the boyfriend box
And in it every saved receipt
Every movie theater ticket just to remind me
Of all the things I've loved and lost and loved again
Unconditionally
Happy

You joke that I'm rich and I am but not how you think
I live in a Tudor house under the freeway
Off of Rose Avenue, 12 blocks from the beach
And when you call I put your sweater on
And put you on speaker
And chat for hours underneath the trees
And think about the last time you were here lying next to me
How the noise from the cars got louder and louder
During rush hour
Until it sounded like a river or a stream
And it felt like we were swimming
But it wasn't just a dream
We were just

Happy

"My Bedroom Is A Sacred Place Now â There Are Children At The Foot Of My Bed"

Last year, when I wrote you my last letter
The beginning of my future poetry
I acknowledged who you really were for the first time

I didn't call you by any other name
I let you know that I knew the true nature of your heart
That it was evil, and that it convinced me that darkness was real
That the devil is a real devil
And that monsters don't always know that they're monsters

But projection is an amazing thing
After you left and burnt the house down
You tried to convince me that it was I who was holding the matches
You told me that I didn't know who I was, but I do

I love rose gardens
I plant violets every time someone leaves me
I love the great sequoias of Yosemite
And if you asked my sister to describe the first thing she thinks of when she thinks of me
She would say "camp fire smoke"

I'm gentle
I'm funny when I'm drunk
But I haven't been drunk for 14 years
I go on trips with my friends to the beach who don't know that I'm crazy
I can do that
I can do anything
Even leave you

Because my bedroom is a sacred place now that there are children at the end of my bed
Telling me stories about the friends that they pretend to hate, that they will make up with later
And there are fresh cut flowers that I grew myself in vases from the yard on nightstands, hand carved by old pals from Big Sur

And the longer I stay here
The more I am sure
But the more I step into becoming a poet
The less I will fall into being with you

The more I step into my poetry
The less I will fall into being with you
The more I step into my poetry
The less I will fall into bed with you

"Paradise Is Very Fragile"

Paradise is very fragile
And it seems like it's only getting worse

Down here in Florida
We're fighting red toxic tides
Mass of fish kills
Not to mention hurricanes and rising sea levels

Back in Los Angeles, things aren't looking much better
My treehouse that'd been standing for 80 years succumbed to the woolsy fire

Who would've thought that this year at 33
You would've been taken out from under me
After all those years?

Built from the ground up, by hand, by your very first owner
Quiet World War One, aviation pilot
I tried to save you but the German Shepherd seemed more important

Paradise is very fragile
And it seems like it's only getting worse

Our leader is a megalomaniac
And we've seen that before
But never 'cause it was what the country deserved

My friends tell me to stop calling 911 on the culture
But it's either that or I 5150 myself

They don't understand
I'm a dreamer
And I had big dreams for the country
Not for what it could do, but how it could feel
How it could think, how it could dream

I know
Who am I to dream for you?
It's just that in my own mind
I was born with a little bit of paradise
I was lucky in that way
Not like my husband
Who was born and raised in hell

I always had something gentle to give
All of me, in fact
It's one of the beautiful things about me
It's one of the beautiful things about nature

But lately I've been thinking that I wish
Someone had told me when I was younger
More about the inhabitants that thrive off of paradise

That should they take too much
There would be nothing left to give
Not everyone's nature is golden and green
And you can't fight what's in your nature

I got to thinking about it as
We were fighting the fires in Agora
But I'm tired of fighting you

Paradise is very fragile
And it's only getting worse

And every time I think of that
I think about the curse bestowed upon Eve, that fateful eve
She took that bite of fruit from that fruitful tree
And this summer night, you in front of me
Makes me contemplate the origins of good and evil

Because you take and you take and you take and you take
But you taste like the beach and a kiss
Candy from my eyes
In my veins you run citrus

Watercolor images of serpents on orange trees
Arise in my midst
Kundalini, you breathe me
I could do this forever

But my heart is very fragile
And I have nothing left to give

"Bare Feet On Linoleum"

Stay on your path Sylvia Plath
Don't fall away like all the others

Don't take all your secrets alone to your watery grave about
Lovers and -

The secrets you keep will keep you in deep like Amy and -
And brother
And all of the people you meet on the street will reiterate lies
That they uttered

Leave me in peace, I cry
In the middle of the night
On a slow boat bound for Catalina for no reason

Tiny drops of perspiration dot my forehead
Could be mistaken for dew drops if this were photo season

But alas this is a real life â and it's been a real fight just to
Stop my mind from committing treason
Why you ask?
Because she told the townspeople I was crazy, and the lies, they
Started to believe them

But anyways â that's all over now

I've moved on, gone scorched earth
And now I'm left wondering where to go from here
To Sonoma where the fires have just left?
South Dakota?

Would standing in front of Mount Rushmore feel like the Great
American homecoming I never had?

Would the magnitude of the scale of the sculptures take the place
Of the warm embrace I've never got

Or should I just be here now
Bare feet on linoleum
Slicing vegetables onto water that I will later turn
Into stew

People love my stories
People love visions

"White Dress"

Sun stare, don't care with my head in my hands
Thinking of a simpler time
Like Sun Ra, feel small
But I had it under control every time

When I was a waitress wearing a white dress
Look how I do this, look how I got this
I was a waitress working the night shift
You were my man, felt like I got this
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
Down in Orlando, I was only nineteen
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
I only mention it 'cause it was such a scene
And I felt seen
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

Summer, sizzling
Listening to jazz out on the lawn
Listening to White Stripes when they were white-hot
Listening to rock all day long

When I was a waitress wearing a tight dress handling the heat
I wasn't famous, just listening to Kings of Leon to the beat
Like look at how I got this, look how I got this
Just singing the street
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
I felt free 'cause I was only nineteen
Such a scene

Summer, summer's almost gone
We were talking about life, we were sitting outside 'til dawn
But I would still go back
If I could do it all again, I thought
Because it made me feel, made me feel like a god
'Cause it made me feel, made me feel like a god
Somehow it made me feel, made me feel like a god

When I was a waitress wearing a white dress
Look how I do this, look how I got this
When I was a waitress working the night shift
You were my man, felt like I got this
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
Down in Orlando, I was only nineteen
Down at the Men in Music Business Conference
I only mention it 'cause it was such a scene
And I felt seen
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

When I was a waitress wearing a tight dress
Like, look how I do it, look how I got this
I was a waitress wearing a tight dress
Like, look how I do this, look how I got this

It made me feel, made me feel like a god
It kinda makes me feel, like maybe I was better off
'Cause it made me feel, made me feel like a god
It kinda makes me feel, like maybe I was better off

"Chemtrails Over The Country Club"

I'm on the run with you, my sweet love
There's nothing wrong contemplating God
Under the chemtrails over the country club
We're in our jewels in the swimming pool
Me and my sister just playing it cool
Under the chemtrails over the country club

Take out your turquoise and all of your jewels
Go to the market, the kids' swimming pools
Baby, what's your sign?
My moon's in Leo, my Cancer is sun
You won't play, you're no fun
Well, I don't care what they think
Drag racing my little red sports car
I'm not unhinged or unhappy, I'm just wild

I'm on the run with you, my sweet love
There's nothing wrong contemplating God
Under the chemtrails over the country club
We're in our jewels in the swimming pool
Me and my sister just playing it cool
Under the chemtrails over the country club

Meet you for coffee at the elementary schools
We laugh about nothing as the summer gets cool
It's beautiful how this deep normality settles down over me
I'm not bored or unhappy, I'm still so strange and wild

I'm in the wind, I'm in the water
Nobody's son, nobody's daughter
Watching the chemtrails over the country club
Suburbia, The Brentwood Market
What to do next? Baby, what of it?
White picket chemtrails over the country club

My love, my love

Washing my hair, doing the laundry
Late night TV, I want you only
Like when we were kids under chemtrails and country clubs
It's never too late, baby, so don't give up
It's never too late, baby, so don't give up
Under the chemtrails over the country club, yeah (You're born in December and I'm born in June)
Under the chemtrails, over the country club, yeah (You're born in December and I'm born in June)

My Cancer is sun and my Leo is moon
My Cancer is sun and my Leo is moon

"Tulsa Jesus Freak"

You should stay real close to Jesus
Keep that bottle at your hand, my man
Find your way back to my bed again
Sing me like a Bible hymn
We should go back to Arkansas
Trade this body for the can of gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind

You should come back to our place, baby
Don't be afraid of our love
On the second floor, darling
In a second flat, hurry up
'Cause down in Arkansas the stores are all closed
The kids in their hoodies, they dance super slow
We're white-hot forever and only God knows

You should stay real close to Jesus
Keep that bottle at your hand, my man
Find your way back to my bed again
Sing me like a Bible hymn
We should go back to Arkansas
Trade this body for the can of gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind

We'll be white-hot forever
White-hot forever
White-hot forever
And ever and ever, amen

Could I come back to the ranch, baby?
I had to get away for a while
Just to rest my nerves, darling
Can I make you laugh with a smile?
You knew when you chose me
I was nothing but ordinary
And now the wind's blowing, reminding you of what you know

You should stay real close to Jesus
Keep that bottle at your hand, my man
Find your way back to my bed again
Sing me like a Bible hymn
We should go back to Arkansas
Trade this body for that can of gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind

We'll be white-hot forever
White-hot forever
White-hot forever
And ever and ever, the end
White-hot forever
White-hot forever
White-hot forever
And ever and ever, amen

You should stay real close to Jesus
If you don't pray, you'll never learn
Keep that bottle at your hand, my man
You know what I'm saying?
Find your way back to my bed again
Sing me like a Bible hymn
We should go back to Arkansas
I like living here
Trade this body for the can of gin
Like a little piece of heaven
No more candle in the wind

"Let Me Love You Like A Woman"

I come from a small town, how 'bout you?
I only mention it 'cause I'm ready to leave LA
And I want you to come
Eighty miles north or south will do
I don't care where as long as you're with me
And I'm with you and you let me

Let me love you like a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be who I'm meant to be
Talk to me in poems and songs
Don't make me be bittersweet
Let me love you like a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me hold you like a baby

I come from a small town far away
I only mention it 'cause I'm ready to leave LA
And I want you to come (And I need you to come)
I guess I could manage if you stay
It's just if you do, I can't see myself having any fun, so

Let me love you like a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be who I'm meant to be
Talk to me in songs and poems
Don't make me be bittersweet
Let me love you like a woman

Take you to infinity
Let me love you like a woman (Let me hold you like a baby)
Take you to infinity
Let me love you like a woman (Let me hold you like a baby)
Take you to infinity

We could get lost in the purple rain
Talk about the good ol' days
We could get high on some pink champagne
Baby, let me count the ways

Let me love you like a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be who I'm meant to be
Talk to me in songs and poems
Don't make me be bittersweet
Let me love you like a woman

"Wild At Heart"

What would you do if I told you
You made me crazy
To see your pretty pics on Sunset Boulevard?
And it makes me lazy
So I smoke cigarettes
Just to understand the smog

I love you lots like polka dots
You're killing me more
Than coffee pots and Insta' thots
With every drop I pour
And if I had to do it all again
I would because, babe, in the end
It brought me here to you

I left Calabasas, escaped all the ashes, ran into the dark
And it made me wild, wild, wild at heart
The cameras have flashes, they cause the car crashes
But I'm not a star
If you love me, you'll love me
'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart
If they love me, they'll love me
'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart

What would you do if I wouldn't sing for them no more?
Like if you heard I was out in the bars drinking Jack and Coke
Going crazy for anyone who would listen to my stories, babe
Time after time, I think about leaving
But you know that I never do just 'cause you keep me believing

I love you lots, despite the odds
You're killing me, John
And all these thoughts brought us apart
And that's okay, too
'Cause even in the worst of times
You saw the best of me
And that's why I stay here with you

I left Calabasas, escaped all the ashes, ran into the dark
And it made me wild, wild, wild at heart
The cameras have flashes, they cause the car crashes
But I'm not a star
If you love me, you'll love me
'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart
If you love me, you'll love me
'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart

'Cause, baby, I'm wild at heart
If you love me, you'll love me
'Cause I'm wild at heart
Baby, I'm wild, wild at heart
If they love me, they'll love me
'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart
If they love me, they'll love me
'Cause I'm wild, wild at heart

"Dark But Just A Game"

"It's dark, but just a game"
That's what he would say to me
The faces aren't the same, but their stories all end tragically
(Sweet or whatever, baby)
And that's the price of fame
A tale as old as time you'd be (Sweet or whatever, baby)
A pretty little fool to think exceptions to the rule
Just walk around like you and me, this way
But life is sweet or whatever, baby
You gotta take them for what they got
And while the whole world is crazy
We're getting high in the parking lot

We keep changing all the time
The best ones lost their minds
So I'm not gonna change
I'll stay the same
No rose left on the vines
Don't even want what's mine
Much less the fame
It's dark, but just a game
It's dark, but just a game

It's dark, but just a game
So play it like a symphony
You know our love's the same, they'll both go down in infamy
I was a pretty little thing and God, I loved to sing
But nothing came from either one but pain (But fuck it)
Life is sweet or whatever, baby
Don't ever think it's not
While the whole world is crazy
We're making out in the parking lot

We keep changing all the time
The best ones lost their minds
So I'm not gonna change
I'll stay the same
No rose left on the vines
Don't even want what's mine
Much less the fame
It's dark, but just a game
We keep changing all the time
The best ones lost their minds
So I'm not gonna change
I'll stay the same
No rose left on the vines
Don't even want what's mine
Much less the fame
It's dark, but just a game
It's dark, but just a game
It's dark, but justâ

"Not All Who Wander Are Lost"

I've been wearing the same damn clothes for three damn days
Lincoln, Nebraska's got me in a haze
The thing about men like you is you got a lot to say
But will you stay?

You say you got my name on your tattoo
Opening up doors, pulling out chairs, look at you
You talk to God like I do, I think you know
The same secrets that I do, I'm talking 'bout

Not all those who wander are lost
Not all those who wander are lost
Not all those who wander, all those who wander
All those who wander are lost
It's just wanderlust

The thing about being on the road
Is there's too much time to think
About seasons of old
As you pour yourself a drink
'Cause every time I said no
It wasn't quite what I meant
If you know what I mean

You said you got my name as your tattoo
Pulling out chairs, opening doors, look at you
You talk to people like I do, I think you know
The same things that I do

Not all those who wander are lost
Not all those who wander are lost
Not all those who wander, all those who wander
All those who wander are lost
It's just wanderlust

Look at me, look at you
Look at what you made me do
Look at me, look at you
Bible on your tattoo
Look at me, look at you
Look at what you made me do
Look at me, look at you

Not all those who wander are lost
Not all those who wander are lost
Not all those who wander, all those who wander
All those who wander are lost
It's just wanderlust

"Yosemite"

Seasons may change
But we won't change
Isn't it sweet how we know that already?
Winter to spring
Spring back to fall
Isn't it cool how nothing here changes at all?

You make me feel I'm invincible
Just like I wanted
No more candle in the wind
It's not like I'm invisible
Not like before when I was burning at both ends

We did it for fun, we did it for free
I did it for you, you did it for me
We did it for the right reasons
We did it for the right reasons

Seasons may change
But we won't change
Isn't it strange how different we are from all of our friends?
Seasons will turn
The world, it will turn
The only thing we'll turn is the pages of all of the poems we burned

Honey, you made me feel I'm invincible
It's just like I wanted
No more candle in the wind
It's not like I'm invisible
Like I was before, no more burning at both ends

Now I do it for fun, I do it for free
I do it for you, you did it for me
We did it for the right reasons
We did it for the right reasons

I remember watching How Green Was My Valley
Then I was thinking
"How deep was the canyon that you came from?"
Television static was quite overwhelming
Was it because of the cabin and the candles in the wind?

We've done it for fun, we've done it for free
I showed up for you, you showed up for me
We did it for the right reasons
We did it for fun, we did it for free

When I was young 'til eternity
I'll do it for the right reasons
Withstanding all the time, changes, and seasons
Right reasons

"Breaking Up Slowly"

Breaking up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, but it's making me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely, but it's the right thing

Are these my good years or do I have none?
Are there really good years for everyone?
I don't wanna live with a life of regret
I don't wanna end up like Tammy Wynette

'Cause breaking up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, but it's making me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely, but it's the right thing to do

George got arrested out on the lawn
We might be breaking up after this song
Will he still love me long after I'm gone?
Or did he see it coming all along?

'Cause breaking up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, and it's making me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely, baby, breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up slowly, baby, breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up slowly is a hard thing to do
I love you only, and it's making me blue
So don't send me flowers like you always do
It's hard to be lonely, but it's the right thing to do

"Dance Till We Die"

I'm covering Joni and I'm dancing with Joan
Stevie is calling on the telephone
Court almost burned down my home
But God, it feels good not to be alone

But sometimes, this ranch feels like my only friend
And life doesn't always work out like we planned
We keep it moving, babe

So we made it back in the middle of the night
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancing 'til we die
We'll keep walking on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancing 'til we die

Troubled by my circumstance
Burdened by the weight of fame
Clementine's not just a fruit
It's my daughter's chosen name

And when all the bars close down tonight
There's one that stays open just for us, alright
We keep dancing, babe

So we made it back in the middle of the night (We keep dancing, babe)
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright (We keep it moving, babe)
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancing 'til we die
We'll keep walking on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancing 'til we die

I went down to Woodside
I left Berkeley, out of city, out of mind
Killing it, talking shit, Joan said she was gonna quit
Tearing it up at the Afro-Caribbean two-step
I left San Francisco
I've been covering Joni and I'm dancing with Joan
It's kinda hard to find love
When you're used to rolling like a rolling stone

So we made it back in the middle of the night (We keep it moving, babe)
To the Louisiana two-step, high and bright (We keep dancing, babe)
And we won't say when, we won't ask why
We won't stop dancing 'til we die
We'll keep walking on the sunny side
And we won't stop dancing 'til we die
And we won't stop dancing 'til we die

"For Free"
(feat. Zella Day & Weyes Blood)

I slept last night in a good hotel
I went shopping today for jewels
The wind rushed around in the dirty town
And the children let out from their school
I was standing on a noisy corner
Waiting for the walking green
Across the street, he stood
And he played real good
On his clarinet for free

Now me, I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I've got a black Limousine and two gentlemen
Who escort me through these halls
And I'll play if you've got the money
Or if you're a friend to me
But the one-man band by the quick lunch stand
He's been playing real good for free

Nobody stopped to hear him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never been on the TV
So they passed his music by
I meant to go over and ask for a song
Maybe put on a harmony
I heard his refrain as the signal changed
He was playing real good for free

"Text Book"

I guess you could call it textbook
I was lookin' for the father I wanted back
And I thought I found it in Brentwood
It seemed only appropriate you'd easily have my back

And then there was the issue of her
I didn't even like myself, or love the life I had
And there you were with shining stars
Standin' blue with open arms
You touched the detriment most of the friends I knew already had

You've got a Thunderbird, my daddy had one, too
Let's rewrite history, I'll do this dance with you
You know I'm not that girl, you know I'll never be
Maybe just the way we're different could set me free
And there we were, screamin' "Black Lives Matter" in the crowd
By the Old Man River, and I saw you saw who I am
God, I wish I was with my father
He could see us in all our splendor
All the things I couldn't want for him
I screamed for them, oh-oh-oh
I screamed for them, ah-ah

Could we do this dance again?
Do you think if I go blonde, we could get our old love back?
I guess this is really the end
I never felt jealous before this year, but I'm jealous now

People say we're too much alike
But maybe, finally, that'll make it right
In the end of all these sleepless nights
Other men I met felt right
Would smile at you and stick a knife
In your back
Finally, I met you so I'm not wonderin' why

You've got a Thunderbird, my daddy had one, too
Let's rewrite history, I'll do this dance with you
You know I'm not that girl, you know I'll never be
Maybe just the way we're different could set me free
There we were, screamin' "Black Lives Matter" in the crowd
By the Old Man River, and I saw you saw who I am
God, I wish I was with my father
He could see us in all our splendor
All the things I couldn't want for him
I screamed for them, oh-oh-oh
I screamed for them, ah-ah

Old Man River keeps rollin'
With or without him
Old Man River keeps rollin'
Without him, oh, my old man
Old Man River keeps rollin', oh

"Blue Banisters"

There's a picture on the wall
Of me on a John Deere
Jenny handed me a beer
Said, "How the hell did you get there?"
Oh, Oklahoma
Mm-mm, mm

There were flowers that were dry
Sittin' on the dresser
She asked me where they're from
I said, "A place I don't remember"
Oh, Oklahoma (Oh-oh)

Jenny jumped into the pool
She was swimmin' with Nikki Lane
She said, "Most men don't want a woman
With a legacy, it's of age"
She said "You can't be a muse and be happy, too
You can't blacken the pages with Russian poetry
And be happy"
And that scared me
'Cause I met a man who

Said he'd come back every May
Just to help me if I'd paint my banisters blue
Blue banisters, ooh
Said he'd fix my weathervane
Give me children, take away my pain
And paint my banisters blue
My banisters blue

There's a hole that's in my heart
All my women try and heal
They're doin' a good job
Convincin' me that it's not real
It's heat lightning, oh-oh-oh, oh

'Cause there's a man that's in my past
There's a man that's still right here
He's real enough to touch
In my darkest nights, he's shinin'
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Jenny was smokin' by the pool
We were writin' with Nikki Lane
I said I'm scared of the Santa Clarita Fires
I wish that it would rain
I said the power of us three can bring absolutely anything
Except that one thing
The diamonds, the rust, and the rain
The thing that washes away the pain
But that's okay, 'cause

Now when weather turns to May
All my sisters come to paint my banisters green
My blue banisters grey
Tex and Mex are in the Bay
Chucky's makin' birthday cake
Chickens runnin', bare feet, there's a baby on the way
And now my blue banisters are green and grey, ah-ah

Summer comes, winter goes
Spring, I skip, God knows
Summer comes, winter goes
Spring, I sleep, Heaven knows
Every time it turns to May
All my sisters fly to me
To paint, paint

"Arcadia"

My body is a map of LA
I stand straight like an angel, with a halo
Hangin' out the Hilton Hotel window
Screamin', "Heyo, baby, let's go"
My chest, the Sierra Madre
My hips, every high and byway
That you trace with your fingertips like a Toyota
Run your hands over me like a Land Rover

In Arcadia, Arcadia
All roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
That pump the blood that flows straight to the heart of me
America, America
I can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel
Or a cross on the hill, I'm a lost little girl
Findin' my way to ya
Arcadia

My body is a map of L.A
And my heart is like paper, I hate ya
I'm not from the land of the palms, so I know I can't stay here
I'm not native, but
My curves, San Gabriel all day
And my lips like the fire licks the bay
If you think that you know yourself, you can come over
Lay your hands on me like you're a Land Rover

In Arcadia, Arcadia
All roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
That get the blood flowing straight to the heart of me
America, I need a miracle
I can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel
Or a cross on the hill, I'm a lost little girl
Findin' my way to ya
Arcadia

They built me up three hundred feet tall just to tear me down
So I'm leavin' with nothing but laughter, and this town
Arcadia
Findin' my way to ya
I'm leavin' them as I was, five foot eight
Western bound, plus the hate that they gave
By the way, thanks for that, on the way, I'll pray for ya
But you'll need a miracle
America

"Black Bathing Suit"

Grenadine quarantine, I like you a lot
It's LA, "Hey" on Zoom, Target parking lot
And if this is the end, I want a boyfriend
Someone to eat ice cream with and watch television
Or walk home from the mall with
'Cause what I really meant is when I'm being honest
I'm tired of this shit

'Cause my body is my temple, my heart is one too
The only thing that still fits me is this black bathing suit
You don't know me any better than they do, baby
My time is run over, so the only time you'll ever see me
Is in your dreams, in my black bathing suit
Lookin' at me lookin' over at you real cute 'cause

He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better
He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better

Swisher Sweet, magazines, promise you it's not
'Cause of you that I'm mean, it's my afterthoughts
And what I never said, why there's a price on my head
It's nothin' to do with them, it's my karmic lineage
So I'm not friends with my mother, but I still love my dad
Untraditional lover, can you handle that?

I guess I'm complicated, my life's sorta too
I wish you could see to my soul through this black bathing suit
You don't know me any better than they do, baby
'Cause I sing like an angel, my heart's like one too
The only thing that fits is this black bathing suit
Lookin' at me lookin' over at you real cute 'cause

He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better
He said I was bad, let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better
They said I was bad, and I'll show them what bad girls do

My black bathing suit
(Oh, let 'em talk about me)
They're just yesterday's news
(They're fucking broke and we're laughin' about them)
Mail me when you get the blues
(We'll have the last laugh about it)
By the way, thanks for the shoes (Haha)
Your interest really made stacks
Your interest really made stacks
Your interest really made stacks out of it
Your interest really made stacks out of it for me
So thanks for that
Your interest really made stacks out of it for me
So thanks for that
Your interest really made stacks out of it for me
So thanks for that

"If You Lie Down With Me"

Put your red boots on, baby, giddy up
Baby wants a dance, baby gets her way
Dreamy nights, talk to me with that whiskey breath
Twirl me twice, I'll treat you like a holiday

And don't say you're over me
When we both know that you ain't
Don't say you're over me
Babe, it's already too late
Just do what you do best with me

Dance me all around the room
Spin me like a ballerina, super high
Dance me all around the moon
Light me up like the Fourth of July
Once, twice, three times the guy I
Ever thought I would meet, so
Don't say you're over me
When we both know that you lie

If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
When you lie down, lie next to me

Get your jacket on, be a gentleman
Get into your truck and pick me up at eight
'Cause we were built for the long haul freight train
Burnt by fire without trial like a stowaway

And don't say you're over me
When they all know that you ain't
If you lay down, lie next to me

Dance me all around the room
Spin me like a ballerina, super high
Dance me all around the moon
Like six times 'till I'm sick and I cry
Once, twice, three times the guy I
Ever thought I would meet, so
Don't say you're over me
When they all know that you're lying

If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
You lie, you lie
If you lie down, lie next to me
Lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
You lie, you lie
When you lie down, lie next to me

"Beautiful"

Lets keep it simple, babe
Don't make me complicated
Don't tell me to be glad when I'm sad
I really hate that
I try not to be bad
He's interested, he's holding me back
If I could be more like you, I would
But I can't, and I'm glad about that

What if someone had asked Picasso not to be sad?
Never known who he was or the man he'd become
There would be no blue period
Let me run with the wolves, let me do what I do
Let me show you how sadness can turn into happiness
I can turn blue into something

Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you

Let's keep it simple, babe
We can't afford to change it
Don't turn me into somethin' I'm not
There's no way to sustain it
I try not to hold back
It seems either way it makes you mad
So I'll be who I'll be if you think that that's cool
Then I'll take you back

What if someone had asked Picasso not to be sad?
Never known who he was or the man he'd become
There would be no blue period
Let me run with the wolves, let me do what I do
Let me show you how sadness can turn into happiness
I can turn blue into something

Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you

Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful like you

"Violets For Roses"

There's something in the air
The girls are runnin' 'round in summer dresses
With their masks off and it makes me so happy
Larchmont Village smells like lilies of the valley
And the bookstore doors are opening
And it's finally happening

Ever since I fell out of love with you I fell back in love with me
And, boy, does it feel sweet
Like a summer breeze
Ever since I fell out of love with you I fell back in love with the city
Like the Paramount sign sparkling
Sparkling just for me

You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to trade in my new truck for Rollses
Don't forget all of these things that you love are the same things I hate
A simple life, I chose this
You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to take all the pink off my toes, and
God knows the only mistake that a man can make
Is tryna make a woman change and trade her violets for roses

Ah-la-ha, ah-ha
Trade her violets for roses
Ah-la-ha, ah-ha

There's something in the air
I hope it doesn't change, that it's for real
The beginning of something big happening
And by the murder alleys
In the streets have ceased
And still the shadows haunt the avenue
The silence is deafening

Ever since I fell out of love with you I fell back in love with the streets
And, God, does it feel sweet
Like a summer breeze
Ever since I fell out of love with you I breakdance to the backbeat
And, God, does it sound sweet
Like it's playing just for me

You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to trade in my new truck for Rollses
Don't forget all of these things that you love are the same things I hate
A simple life, I chose this
You made me trade my violets for roses
You tried to take all the pink off my toes, and
God knows the only mistake that a man can make
Is tryin' to make a woman change and trade her violets for roses

Ah-la-ha, ah-ha
Trade her violets for roses
Ah-la-ha, ah-ha
Trade her violets for roses
(Ah-la-ha, ah-ha)

There's something in the air
The girls are runnin' 'round in summer dresses
With their masks off and it makes me so happy

"Dealer"
(feat. Miles Kane)

Please don't try to find me through my dealer
He won't pick up his phone
Please don't try my father either
He ain't been home for years
I know I'm no spirit seeker
I can't sleep through the tears
I get lost in the ether

I check it, I wreck it, I turn it around
I gave you all my money, gave you all my money
Gave you all my money, gave you all my money
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna give you nothing
'Cause you never give me nothing back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back

Please don't try to find me through my dealer
He won't pick up his phone
Please don't try my doctor either
He won't take any calls
He's no fucking spirit healer
He just can't stop to talk
But he's gone now for the weekend

I check it, I wreck it, and I'll explain
I gave you all my money, gave you all my money
Gave you all my money, gave you all my money
I don't wanna live
I don't wanna give you nothing
'Cause you never give me nothing back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back
Why can't you be good for something?
Not one shirt off your back

555
Please don't try to find me through my dealer
9275, 555
Now you've got a busy tone
He won't pick up his phone
All circuits are busy, goodbye
All circuits are busy, you're high
Please don't try my father either
All circuits are busy, goodbye
All circuits are busy, you're high
He ain't been home for years

"Thunder"

You roll like thunder
When you come crashin' in
Town ain't been the same
Since you left with all your friends
You roll like thunder
When you come crashing in
Regattas in the wind
That's why you're visiting

You act like fucking Mr. Brightside when you're with all your friends
But I know what you're like
When the party ends

Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait

You roll like thunder
Pourin' all your drinks
The party's lit and you, my friend, half-cut when it begins
You roll like thunder
You're tryna catch that wind
That lightning in the bottle
That moonbeam in your hand

And you try to see the bright side when each new day begins
But you're not satisfied
At the rainbow's end

Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
I don't wanna wait
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait

'Cause if you're on fire, you're on fire (Just do it)
Just keep burnin', 'til rain (Just do it, don't wait)
Baby, keep me ablaze
Honey, if you're on fire, you're on fire (Just do it)
Just keep burning, keep me alive (Just do it, don't wait)
Spare your blade

Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
If hello just means goodbye then honey, better walk away
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
If hello just means goodbye then baby, better walk away
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait
'Cause I don't wanna wait
Just do it
Just do it, don't wait

(Just do it)
(Just do it, don't wait)
If you're on fire, you're on fire
You should just keep burning
(Just do it)
(Just do it, don't wait)
(Just do it)
(Just do it, don't wait)

"Wildflower Wildfire"

Here's the deal
'Cause I know you wanna talk about it
Here's the deal
I promise you, like, a million tomorrows
Here's the deal
What I can promise is I'll lie down
Like a bed of wildflowers
And I'll always make the sheets
Smell like gardenias wild at your feet
And I nourish you hazily

Baby, I, I, I, I've been runnin' on stardust
Alone for so long
I wouldn't know what hot fire was
Hot fire, hot weather, hot coffee
I'm better with you
It's strange, but it's true, darling

Not to turn into a wildfire
To light up your night
With only my smile and nothing that burns
Baby, I'll be like a wildflower
I live on sheer willpower
I'll do my best never to turn into something
That burns, burns, burns
Like the others, baby, burns, burns, burns

Here's the deal
'Cause I know you wanna talk about it
Here's the deal
You say there's gaps to fill in, so here
Here's the deal
My father never stepped in when his wife would rage at me
So I ended up awkward but sweet
Later then hospitals, and still on my feet
Comfortably numb, but with lithium came poetry

And baby, I, I've been running on star drip
IV's for so long
I wouldn't know how cruel the world was
Hot fire, hot weather, hot coffee, I'm better
So I turn, but I learn (It from you, babe)

Not to turn into a wildfire
To light up your night
With only my smile and nothing that hurts
Baby, I run like a wildflower
I live on sheer willpower
I promise that nothing will burn you
Nothing will burn, burn, burn
Like the others, baby, burns, burns, burns
Burn, burn, burn (Like the others, baby)
Like the others, baby, burns, burns, burns

It's you from whom I learn, learn, learn
It's you from whom I learn, learn, learn

"Nectar Of The Gods"

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

What cruel world is this? Nectar of the Gods
Heroin gold in my veins, and you in my thoughts
I'm on the freeway racing at a million and I just can't stop
I call you up twice, hang up the phone, call again, I wanna talk

I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like you never knew, knew, knew
I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like the color blue, ooh-ooh

What sweet world is this? Honey on the vine
School kid dreams came true then passed in the night
I used to dream about people like you, now I don't know why
I used to sing about people like you, now I just get high

I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like you never knew, knew, knew
I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like the color blue, ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like you never knew, ooh, ooh
I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fuckin' crazy like the color blue, ooh-ooh

Californ-I-A, homeland of the Gods
Once I found my way but now I am lost

"Living Legend"

Blackbirds will sing in the same key
As you play in the shoes that I bought you
And sweet baby Jane don't know a thing
About my songs but she knows I'm a monsoon

And baby you, all the things you do
And the ways you move, send me straight to heaven
And baby you, what you never knew
What I never said, is you're my living legend

Hipsters will sing just like a dream
In Sin-Ã© or the back Brooklyn bayou
But you never cared about my name
And darling I never meant to defy you

But baby you, all them things you do
And those ways you moved, send me straight to heaven
And baby you, I never said to you
You really are my living legend

I got guns in the summertime and horses too
Guns in the summertime and horses too
I never meant to be bad or unwell
I was just living on the edge
Right between Heaven and Hell
And I'm tired of it

Oh, all the things you do
And the ways you move, send me straight to heaven
And baby you, what I never said to you
'Cause you really are my living legend

Why, why, why
Why, why, why
Why, why, why
Why, why, why

My living legend
My living legend
My living legend
My living legend

"Cherry Blossom"

What you don't tell no one, you can tell me
Little ghost, tall, tan like milk and honey
You're very brave
And very free

I push you high, cherry blossom on your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me

Swing it high like Jesus, wild and free
Dandelions in your hair, baby
You're very brave
And there's much to see

I push you high, cherry blossom on your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me

And when you're scared
I'll be right here
You feel afraid
Mommy is there
It's a cruel, cruel world
But we don't care
'Cause what we've got
We've got to share

What you don't tell no one, you can tell me
Little ghost, blonde hair with lemonade tea
There's much to learn
And so much to see

I push you high, Angelina, on your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me

"Sweet Carolina"

(Okay)
Don't have to write me a letter
'Cause I'll always be right here
Closer to you than your next breath, my dear

We love every hair on your head
Love you like God loves you
And you say that you're scared
Might be unprepared for havin' the baby blues

Baby blues, baby blues
If things ever go wrong
Just know this is your song and we love you

You name your babe Lilac Heaven
After your iPhone 11
"Crypto forever" screams your stupid boyfriend
Fuck you, Kevin

We love every freckle you have
We love you like God loves you
If you're ever stressed out, just dance in the night
If you get those baby blues

Baby blues, baby blues
If things ever go wrong
Just know this is your song and we love you

Pink slippers all on the floor and woven nets over the door
It's as close as we'll get to the dream that they had
In the one night sixties, and
Jason is out in the lawn
And he powerwashes every time things go wrong
If you're stressed out, just know you can dance to your song
'Cause we got you

If you get the blues, baby blues
Just know this is your song
It'll live on and on, way past me and you
If you get the blues, baby blues
You've got us, we've got you
So there's nothing to lose, and we love you

So don't write me a letter
I'll always be right here
Closer to you than your next breath, my dear

"The Grants"

One, two, ready
I'm gonna take mine with you with me
Ah, "Mine," say it again
"Mine of you with me," thank you
One more time
One, two, ready
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
Like "Rocky Mountain High"
The way John Denver sings

So you say there's a chance for us?
Should I do a dance for once?
You're a family man, but
But

Do you think about Heaven? Oh-oh
Do you think about me?
My pastor told me
"When you leave, all you take
Uh-huh, is your memories"

And I'm gonna take mine of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with me

So many mountains too high to climb
So many rivers, so long, but I'm
Doin' the hard stuff, I'm doin' my time
I'm doin' it for us, for our family line

Do you think about Heaven? Oh-oh
Do you think about me?
My pastor told me (I'll do it, I'll do it)
"When you leave, all you take (I did it, I did it)
Uh-huh, is your memories"

And I wanna take mine of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
Yeah, I'm gonna take mine of you with me
Like "Rocky Mountain High," the way John Denver sings

My sister's first-born child
I'm gonna take that too with me
My grandmother's last smile
I'm gonna take that too with me
It's a beautiful life
Remember that too for me

Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah

"Did You Know That There's A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd"

Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd
Mosaic ceilings, painted tiles on the wall
I can't help but feel someone like my body marred my soul
Handmade beauty, sealed up by two man-made walls
And I'm like

When's it gonna be my turn?
When's it gonna be my turn?
Open me up, tell me you like it
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd
There's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd

There's a girl that sings Hotel California
Not because she loves the notes or sounds, the sound that floated out
It's because she's in a world preserved, only a few have found the door
It's like Camarillo, only silver mirrors running down the corridor
Oh, man

When's it gonna be my turn?
Don't forget me
When's it gonna be my turn?
Open me up, tell me you like me
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd
Don't forget me
There's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd

Harry Nilsson has a song, his voice breaks at 2:05
Something about the way he says, "Don't forget me"
Makes me feel like
I just wish I had a friend like him, someone to give me fire
Leaning in my back, whispering in my ear
"Come on, baby, you can drive"
But I can't

When's it gonna be my turn?
Don't forget me
When's it gonna be my turn?
Open me up, tell me you like it
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd

Don't forget me
At the tunnel under Ocean Blvd
Don't forget me
At the tunnel under Ocean Blvd
Don't forget me
At the tunnel under Ocean Blvd

Don't forget me, don't forget me
No, no, no, don't forget me
Don't you, don't you forget me (No, oh)

"Sweet"

Stars in my eyes, hiking up Griffith
Thinking about who was sad and what didn't
Get said in the Midwest, wish I could tell you now
I wrote you a note, but I didn't send it
'Cause that's the best method the women here taught me about
What you don't really understand
I've got magic in my hand, stars in my eyes

I'm a different kind of woman
If you want some basic bitch go to the Beverly Center and find her
I'm sweet
Bare feet
If you wanna go where nobody goes
That's where you'll find me
In the sweet north country
If I'm not there, come to my house on Genesee

What you doing with your life? Do you think about it?
Do you contemplate where we came from?
Lately, we've been making out a lot
Not talking 'bout the stuff that's at the very heart of things
Do you want children? Do you wanna marry me?
Do you wanna run marathons in Long Beach by the sea?
I've got things to do like nothing at all
I wanna do them with you, do you wanna do them with me?

If you want someone, then just call me up
And remember where I'll be
Sweet and bare feet
You can find me where no one will be
In the woods somewhere, in the night
In the heart of a valley
In the sweet north country
If I'm not there, come to my house on Genesee

"A&W"

I haven't done a cartwheel since I was nine
I haven't seen my mother in a long, long time
I mean, look at me
Look at the length of my hair, and my face, the shape of my body
Do you really think I give a damn
What I do after years of just hearing them talking?

I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter

Call him up, "Come into my bedroom"
Ended up, we fuck on the hotel floor
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore
This is the experience of bein' an American whore

Called up one drunk, called up another
Forensic Files wasn't on
Watching Teenage Diary of a Girl
Wondering what went wrong
I'm a princess, I'm divisive
Ask me why, why, why I'm like this
Maybe I'm just kinda like this
I don't know, maybe I'm just like this

I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter

Call him up, he comes over again
Yeah, I know I'm over my head but, oh
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore

I mean look at my hair
Look at the length of it and the shape of my body
If I told you that I was raped
Do you really think that anybody would think
I didn't ask for it? I didn't ask for it
I won't testify, I already fucked up my story
On top of this (Mm), so many other things you can't believe
Did you know a singer can still be
Looking like a sidepiece at thirty-three?
God's a charlatan, don't look back, babe
Puts the shower on while he calls me
Slips out the back door to talk to me
I'm invisible, look how you hold me
I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I'm a ghost now, look how you hold me now

It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore (Oh, okay)
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore

This is the experience of bein' an American whore
This is the experience of bein' an American whore
This is the experience of bein' an American whore
Woo

Jimmy, Jimmy, cocoa puff, Jimmy, Jimmy, ride

Jimmy, if you switch it up, you should light it up
Jimmy, if you leave the house, find me in the club (Like, surf's up)
Your mom called, I told her, you're fuckin' up big time
But I don't care, baby, I already lost my mind
Jimmy, if I lie it up, find me in the club (Mind, mind)
Your mom called, I told her, you're fucking up big time

Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high

Jimmy only love me when he wanna get high
Your mom called, I told her, you're fuckin' up big time

"Judah Smith Interlude"

I don't understand what that means
It means quit lusting after your neighbor
That's a heck of a life
You get to love your children in front of you
You get to love, you have to talk to somebody "I want a new life"
"I don't love my wife anymore, I don't love my kids anymore
Missing out on life at usually my age"
Does that sound like love?
It's a life dominated with lust
And for too long, they've been holding it up
And finally, they just get weak and they say
"It doesn't matter anymore"
And the Spirit of God says, "I'll infuse you with desires for what you have and what's in front of you."
(Yeah, yeah)

So, as it works deep in your heart
As you call out to Him and say, "How could you do it to me, Man?"
Help me want what I got. Help me love what's in front of me
Help me want more of my wife and more of my friends
And help me serve the city I live in
And not wish it away and hope I can move
Help me, God
I wanna be a man in love, not a man in lust."
But you've gotta do that
So I bring you to this verse, then I'm done, I'm done
Psalms, chapter 8

And do you know where I got this verse?
This is gonna sound crazy to you, but I'm gonna tell you the absolute truth
It's gonna make me sound so superior to us all
I'm looking forward to it
I woke up this morning and God said, "Check the Bible"
I don't know if it was God, but if felt like God in my head
I thought if I hadn't checked the Bible
I'm gonna speak to you from the verse of the day
That means I don't have to do anything, I don't have to look anywhere
Just get to the verse of the day
So I get to the verse of the day and here's the verse of the day
Today, in the Bible

Look at this (It's cool)
Look at the splendor of the skies
You creative genius glowing in the heavens
When I gaze, when I gaze at Your moon and Your stars
Mounted like jewels in their setting
I know, You are the fascinating artist who fashioned it all
When I look up and I see such wonder and workmanship above
I have to ask this question
I've gotta ask this question
Compared to all this cosmic glory
Why would you ever bother with puny, mortal men
Or beâooh, don't get me started, I could preach another hourâbe infatuated
Totally infatuated with Adam's son?

Why are you so infatuated with me?
You're the star creator, You're the ocean maker (Yeah, yeah)
You're the whale creator, you're the rhino designer
Who, who are you? (Rhino designer)
And then, and then it goes on in verse 5
And it says, "Yet what honor you have given to men
Created only a little lower than Elohim
Which is the name of Creator God
Artist God"
You wanna call God "artist"
At some point tonight when you go to bed pray
"Yo, Elohim," and he'll hear, "You're the best artist ever"

Crowned like kings and queens with glory and magnificence
You have delighted, You delegated to them mastery over all You have made
You've made me a partner with You
I used to think my preaching was mostly about you
And you're not gonna like this but I'm gonna to tell You the truth
I've discovered my preaching is mostly about me

"Candy Necklace"
(feat. Jon Batiste)

White flowers, cinnamon on my teeth
And I'm sittin' at a stoplight in northern town
I feel lucky
I drive somewhere out of range, I don't know where
White noise coming out of my brain
Turns off for nothing

Rockefella, my umbrella
God, I love you, baby
Storyteller, us forever
Is my favorite song

You've been acting pretty restless
Dancin' like the young and restless
And I'm obsessed with it
Candy necklaces
You've been acting pretty reckless
Dancing like the young and restless
And I'm obsessed with this
All his candy necklaces

Sittin' on the sofa, feelin' super suicidal
Hate to say the word, but, baby, hand on the Bible
I do feel like it's you the one who's bringing me down
Thought that we were cool, we were kicking it like Tribe Called Quest
You're the best, but, baby, you've been bringing me down
I can see it now

Rockafella, my umbrella
God I love you, baby
Fortune teller, favorite ever
Was the story of us

You've been acting pretty restless
Dancin' like the young and reckless
And I'm obsessed with this
Candy necklaces
I think that we should address this
Acting like the young and restless
I'm obsessed with this
All his candy necklaces

We've been acting pretty restless
Dancin' like the young and restless
I'm obsessed with this
Candy necklaces

Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces (Mm)
Candy necklaces (Mhm)
Candy necklaces (I'm obsessed with this)
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces ('Cause I'm obsessed with this)
Candy necklaces (Mm)
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces
Candy necklaces, oh

"Jon Batiste Interlude"

Oh
Ooh, I'm feelin' somethin' right now
I didn't know I was gon' feel it so early
I feel it early, I feel it
I feel it early
Woo, woohoo
I feel it early and I feel it late
Oh, my goodness
Yeah, I feel it
I feel it
I didn't know I was gonna feel it heavy
I feel it heavy

I am your honey
You're the sun dancing to the moon
Ah, ooh

I feel it heavy
I feel it, oh, my god
Oh
Yeah
Oh, wow
Yeah
Woo, you mean whenâ, oh

Oh, my god

Early in the morning

Hey, ooh
Early in the morning
Oh
Hold on, that's pretty cute, how about that?
Early in the morning
Yeah
That's some [?]
Early in the morning
Oh, sweet
Sweet honey, oh

"Kintsugi"

There's a certain point the body can't come back from
In one year, we've learned the turn of the mouth
The depth that the chest cavity takes
Chucky was there for three out of three
I was there for the third 'cause I couldn't be
There for the one who was closest to me
But I can't say I'd run when things get hard
It's just that I don't trust myself with my heart
But I've had to let it break a little more
'Cause they say that's what it's for

That's how the light shines in
That's how the light shines in
That's how the light gets in

So everyone was there, they were standing and laughing
And I'm on the side with my tears streaming down
There's something about the clutch of the wrist
He thought mine was his to carve into his mouth
We've only got hours
And I just can't stop crying 'cause all of the ways
When you see someone dying
You see all your days flash in front of you
And you think about who would be with you
And then there's Donoghue

Daddy, I miss them
I'm in the mountains
I'm probably running away from the feelings I get
When I think of all the things about them
Daddy, I miss them
I'm at the Roadrunner CafÃ©
I'm probably running away from the thoughts in the day
I had things to do with them, but they say

That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in

Think by the 3rd of March, I was cracked open
Finally the ground was cold, they wouldn't open
Brought by the sunlight of the spirit to pour into rain
There's a name for it in Japanese, it's kintsugi
They sang folk songs from the '40s
Even the fourteen-year old knew "Froggie Came A-Courtin'"
How do my blood relatives know all of these songs?
I don't know anyone left to know songs that I sing

That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in

But daddy, I miss them
I'm at the Roadrunner CafÃ©
Probably running away from the feelings today
In the snow-capped mountains of the desert
Daddy, I miss them
I'm in the mountains
Probably running away, I've been meaning to say
That there's nothing to do except know that this is

How the light gets in
Like the cracking, the light gets in
It's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
Then you're golden
Ah, ah, ah
Just another folk song, but anyway
I try so hard, but that's okay
It's how the light gets in
It's how the light gets in
It's how the light gets in

"Fingertips"

When I look back, tracing fingertips over plastic bags
Thinking, "I wish I could extrapolate some small intention
Or maybe just get your attention for a minute or two"

Will I die? Or will I get to that ten-year mark?
Where I beat the extinction of telomeres?
And if I do, will you be there with me, Father, Sister, Brother?

Charlie, stop smoking
Caroline, will you be with me?
Will the baby be alright?
Will I have one of mine?
Can I handle it
Even if I do?
You said that I might
It's not fair or so they said
To carry a child
I guess I'll be fine

It wasn't my idea the cocktail of things that twist neurons inside
But without them, I'd die
They say there's irony in the music, it's a tragedy
I see nothing Greek in it
Give me a mausoleum in Rhode Island with Dad, Grandma, Grandpa and Dave
Who hung himself real high
In the National Park sky, it's a shame and I'm crying right now
To get to you, save you if I take my life
Find your astral body, put it into my eyes
Give you two seconds to cry
Take you home, I, I'll give you a blanket
Your spirit can sit and watch TV by my side
'Cause, baby, I ran through a time when I felt you were doing it

I couldn't handle it, I was in Monaco
I couldn't hear what they said on the telephone
I had to sing for the prince in two hours
Sat in the shower
Gave myself two seconds to cry
It's a shame that we die

When I was fifteen, naked, next-door neighbors did a drive-by
Pulled me up by my waist, long hair to the beach side
I wanted to go out like you, swim with the fishes
That he caught on Rhode Island beaches
But, sometimes, it's just not your time

Caroline, what kind of mother was she to say I'd end up in institutions?
All I wanted to do was kiss Aaron Greene and sit by the lake
Twisting lime into the drinks that they made
Have a babe at sixteen, the town I was born in and died

Aaron ended up dead and not me
What the fuck's wrong in your head to send me away never to come back
Exotic places and people to take the place of being your child?
I give myself two seconds to cry
Let it crash over me like
The waves in the sea
Call me Aphrodite
As they bow down to me

Sunbather, moon chaser, queen of empathy
I give myself two seconds to breathe
And go back to being a serene queen
I just needed two seconds to be me

"Paris, Texas"
(feat. SYML)

I went to Paris (Texas)
With a suitcase in my hand
I had to leave
Knew they wouldn't understand

When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It's time, it's time to go
When you know, you know
Then the more you know
It's time to go

I took a trip to Spain
Just a notebook in my hand
Then I went to see some friends of mine
Down in Florence, Alabama

When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It's time, it's time to go
When you know, you know
That it's time to leave
Like the summer breeze

When everyone star's bright
Brighter than you are
It's time to go
And you're the only one left
Dancin' while theyâre on the floor
Time to go

I flew back home
It seems everything's the same (Venice, California)
Except that you aren't home
Hello, I call to know why (But)

When you're home, you're home (Venice, California)
When you're home, you're home (Venice, California)
When you're home, when you're alone
When you're right, you're right
When you're right, you're right
Even when you're wrong

"Grandfather Please Stand On The Shoulders Of My Father While He's Deep-Sea Fishing"
(feat. RIOPY)

Three white butterflies to know you're near

I know they think, that it took somebody else
To make me beautiful (Beautiful)
As they intended me to be
But they're wrong
I know they think
That it took thousands of people
To put me together again
Like an experiment
Some big men behind the scenes
Sewing Frankenstein black dreams into my songs
But they're wrong

God, if you're near me send me three white butterflies
Or an owl to know you're listening, sitting while I'm drinking
Grandfather, please stand on the shoulders of my father
While he's deep-sea fishing for sharks in the Pacific
'Cause I'm good on spirit, warm-bodied
A fallible deity wrapped up in white
I'm folk, I'm jazz, I'm blue, I'm green
Regrettably, also a white woman

But I have good intentions even if I'm one of the last ones
If you don't believe me, my poetry or my melodies
Feel it in your bones
I have good intentions even if I'm one of the last ones
(Ah-ha-ah, yeah, ah-ha-ah, yeah, ah-ha-ah, yeah)

Grandfather, please stand on the shoulders of my father
While he's deep-sea fishing for all the things he's wishing
God, if you're near me, send me three white butterflies
Or a map to know Your vision, impart on me Your wisdom

It took somebody else to make me beautiful
Wonderful
As they intended me to be
But they're wrong

Three white butterflies to know you're near

"Let The Light In"
(feat. Father John Misty)

[Lana Del Rey:]
Pick you up at home, quarter to three
Ask you if you want somethin' to eat
Drive around, get drunk, do it over again
Wake you up at night, quarter to one
I can never stop, wanna have fun
Don't be actin' like I'm the kinda girl who can sleep

'Cause every time you say you're gonna go
I just smile 'cause babe, I already know
You know I got nothin' under this overcoat

[Lana Del Rey & Father John Misty:]
Ooh, let the light in
At your back door yelling 'cause I wanna come in
Ooh, turn your light on
Look at us, you and I, back at it again

[Lana Del Rey:]
Pick you up around quarter to two
Usually we got nothin' to do
Screw it, maybe you should go and record some other songs
Got my dress on tight 'cause you know that I
Look shinin' in the light, there's so much ridin'
On this life and how we write a love song

[Lana Del Rey & Father John Misty:]
Ooh, let the light in
At your back door yelling 'cause I wanna come in
Ooh, turn your light on
Look at us, you and I back at it again

[Lana Del Rey:]
'Cause I love to love, to love, to love, to love you
I hate to hate, to hate, to hate you
Put the Beatles on, light the candles, go back to bed
'Cause I wanna, wanna, wanna want you
I need to, need to, need to need you
Put the TV on, flowers in a vase, lie your head

[Lana Del Rey & Father John Misty:]
Ooh, let the light in
At your back door yelling 'cause I wanna come in
Ooh, turn your light on
Look at us, you and me back at it again

"Margaret"
(feat. Bleachers)

[Lana Del Rey:]
This is a simple song, I'm gonna write it for a friend
My shirt is inside out, I'm messy with the pen
He met Margaret on a rooftop, she was wearing white
And he was like, "I might be in trouble"
He had flashes of the good life, he was like
"Should I jump off this building now or do it on the double?"

[Lana Del Rey & Jack Antonoff:]
'Cause, baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble

When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It kinda makes me laugh, running down that path
When you're good, it's gold
'Cause when you know, you know

[Jack Antonoff:]
A word to all my friends
But there are red flags, they are not nice
There are black eyes and there are blue eyes
If you're asking yourself, "How do you know?"
Then that's your answer, the answer is "No"
Yeah, gotta run, gotta run around like your head's on fire
Run away like your head is on fire

[Lana Del Rey & Jack Antonoff:]
'Cause, baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble

[Lana Del Rey & Jack Antonoff, Lana Del Rey:]
When you know, you know
When you know, you know
It kinda makes me laugh, running down that path
When you're good, it's gold
'Cause when you know, you know
When you're old, you're old
Like Hollywood in me, the diamond on your ring
The soul that you bring to the table
One that makes me see, eeh-eeh-eeh
In a minor key
'Cause when you know, you know
When you know, you know

[Lana Del Rey:]
So, if you don't know
Don't give up
'Cause you never know what the new day might bring

[Lana Del Rey & Jack Antonoff:]
Maybe tomorrow you'll know
Maybe tomorrow you'll know
Maybe tomorrow you'll know

[Lana Del Rey:]
I mean, join the party
By the way, the party is December 18
(Okay, let's waltz this out, 'cause)

[Lana Del Rey & Jack Antonoff:]
'Cause when you know, you know
When you're old, you're old
Like Hollywood in me, that diamond on your ring
The soul that you bring to the table

[Lana Del Rey:]
One that makes me see, eeh-eeh-eeh
In a minor key
Diamond on your ring
'Cause when you know, you know
When you know, you know

"Fishtail"

Don't you dare say that you'll braid my hair, babe
If you don't really care
You wanted me sadder, you wanted me sadder
Fishtail is the matter, like that, ah-ah-ah

Skipping rope in the bayou, bayou
Slip softly into rain
Not that smart but I've got things to say
Palm trees in black and white
I like to watch them sway
You're so funny, I wish I could skinny-dip inside your mind
Lately I've been thinking about how things used to be
Swinging in a nightgown underneath the old oak tree
Almost Victorian with you, you can talk to me
But lately, I can't see

You wanted me sadder
You wanted me sadder
Baby, can't you see it?
(You wanted me sadder)
For me, you are the one
And if I'm not the one for you
Don't you see it?
I was on the stairs
Ella Fitzgerald in the air
Feelin' hella rare
Baby, if you care
Baby, don't you dare say
You'll braid my hair, babe
Don't you dare say
That you'll braid my hair
Babe, if you don't really care
You wanted me sadder

Dancing there in the hot out sun
I know that we've got problems
I plan to address them another day
Palm trees in black and white
I see in Technicolor
Maybe I'll take my glasses off so I'll stop painting red flags green
Lately I've been sunning in the L.A. river bed
Wearing nothing but the summer bruises on my knees
I like how you talk, how you speak, how you look at me
But lately, I can't see

You wanted me sadder
Baby, can't you see it?
(You wanted me sadder)
For me, you are the one
If I'm not the one for you
Don't just see it?
I was on the stairs
Ella Fitzgerald in the air
Feelin' hella rare
Baby, if you care
Baby, don't you dare say
You'll braid my hair
See, baby, if you care
Then, baby, don't you dare say
(Don't you dare say that you'll braid my hair, see)
That you really care
Don't you dare say that you'll braid my hair
When you get home tonight
If you don't really care
Yeah, don't you dare say that you'll braid my hair, babe
If don't really care, see
Don't you care say that you'll braid my hair if you're not coming home to me
Hmm-mm

You want someone sadder
Skipping rope in the bayou, bayou
Slip softly into rain
I'm not that smart
But I've got things to say

"Peppers"

Me and my boyfriend listen to the Chili Peppers
We write hit songs without trying like all the time, all the time
I take off all my clothes, dance naked for the neighbors
I'm like, "Fuck it, gonna give a show", I open up the blinds

I threw caution to the wind, get on to the bike
Take a minute to yourself, skinny dip in my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love
Got a knife in my jacket, honey, I'm divine
Baby, I'll bring the coffee if you bring the wine
I'm in love, I'm in love

"Taco Truck x VB"

Met my boyfriend down at the taco truck
Pass me my vape, I'm feeling sick, I need to take a puff
Imagine if we actually gave a fuck
Wouldn't that be something to talk about for us?
Caribbean blue in sweater weather, I'm falling into you
Although it seems I've gotten better, I can be violent too

That's why they call me Lanita
When I get down I'm bonita
Don't come find me in Reseda
I'll go crazy
Read my gold chain, says, "Lanita"
When I'm violent, it's Carlito's Way
Blood on my feet on the street
I'm dancin' crazy

Spin it 'til you whip it into a cream, baby
Print it to black and white pages don't faze me
Before you talk, let me stop what you're saying
I know, I know, I know that you hate me

Honey, I got up so early
And then, I got into the shower
I was just able to go back to sleep for a hour and a half
So that rocked, um, anyway (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
I had this dream where, um, aha, I don't know
(Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss)

You heard my baby's back in town now
You should come, come over
We'll be hanging around now
You should come, come over
Back, back to the garden
We're getting high now because we're older
Me myself, I like diamonds
Oh baby, crimson and clover

Oh God, I miss you on my lips
It's me, your little Venice Bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss

(Ah, shatter)
Calling out, bang bang, kiss kiss
(Ah, yeah, ah, shatter)
Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss
(Yeah, yeah)

Back in the garden
We're getting high now because we're older
Me myself, I like diamonds
But baby, crimson and clover
Wha-wha-wha-wha-whatever
Everything, whatever
Wha-wha-wha-wha-whatever
Everything's whatever

Oh God, I miss you on my lips (I do, I do)
It's me, your little Venice bitch (Yes, it is)
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss

(Ah, shatter)
Calling out, bang bang, kiss kiss
(Ah, yeah, ah, shatter)
Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss
(Yeah, yeah)

If you weren't mine (Get high), I'd be jealous of your love (Drunk acid)
If you weren't mine (Never die), I'd be jealous of your love (Not tonight, Lake Placid)
If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
(Oh, God, I miss you on my lips)
If you weren't mine, I'd be jealous of your love
(On the stoop with the neighborhood kids)
(Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss)
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss
Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss

"1949"

Carry me up them stairs
With my white socks on
And my pretty song
You like my blue nail polish?
What is all this? You said
Of the mess upstairs
Don't be scared

Daddy dearest, you know
How I like to take trips
Pops, first stops at the K-Mart, buy me my peach lip-gloss
Cigarettes and lollipops
For our trip across the USA

We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in the Pontiac from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Gonna party like it's 1949

Carry me up the stairs
With my white socks on
And my blonde hair long
You like my pin-up bodice and the solace
That comes with the midnight air
And my icy stare

It's the clearest when it's me and him alone
He stops, he talks about all the ways he used
To about all ways he used to [?]
Dinerettes and soda pops for our trip across the USA

We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in the Pontiac from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Gonna party like it's 1949

Daddy likes Blackpool Pleasure Beach and road stops
Me, I like the Swiss Alps souvenir gift shops
Late night, midnight radio show talks
Him and me, a big jailbreak

Ponytail and lollipops, dinerettes and soda pops
New blue bathing suit, ruched tops and Cadillacs
Blue lake, Carter Docks, hopscotch, hot talk
Alabama hard knocks, motel brass locks

"Afraid"

I'm America's sweetheart
Tryna get away
You make it hard to leave
But it's easier for me to stay
Why I'm so afraid

And I've had it up to here
With the fighting, baby, we're
Not fooling anyone these days
I don't wanna stray
But boy, I'm so afraid

But it's not love that keeps me here
And it's not what you want to hear

So I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
And I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
Thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid

We were just teenagers when we fell in love
Driving in your fast car
Looking at the stars above
But it was not enough
You should never come between
A woman and her dream
And a man who never knew his place
There's no easy way
To come back from where you came

So, I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
I-I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
Nothing in your heart, boy
I thought that I could make you change
But I'm so afraid

And it's not love, it's just the fear
That you've put down for all these years

But I'm leaving now
I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
I am done being afraid
Oh, I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
I thought that I could make you change
But I'm so afraid

Oh, it's not love that keeps me here
It's not love that keeps me here
I'm done being afraid
I'm done being afraid
Oh, oh, oh

"All Smiles"

All dressed up, with nowhere to go
That's the story of the girl you know
Me
I'm all smiles but inside I frown
'Cause I've seen you walking around with Betty Lou
Didn't I tell you what I heard about her?

It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you what them other girls do
You'll date anyone, you'll date anyone

Are they more fun than me, baby?
I'm smiling, the New Jersey queen
And you're the best thing I ever seen
So won't you pull up your white corvette
Jimmy, let me get a better look at your face
I know it ain't doing
But I know what you like
So come on inside and I'll fix you ice-cream
A little banana split for you, Jim

You're so fine, you're like silk la roux
Guess that's why you keep slipping through my fingers
You're the state's number one
Everybody knows it
You smile all the time
'Cause how can you not show it
When even you know
That you're so
To die for, to die for
What do I need to get high for?
When I have you
When I have you

It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you what those other girls done
I'm gonna prove to you
I'm gonna prove to you
You'll never find nobody more fun

Dah, dah, dah
More fun

"Angels Forever"

Is the sun in your eyes, easy rider?
Do the flame-colored skies light your fire?
We are heavy-metal lions

Forever angels (angels, angels)
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)
They were angels forever
Forever angels

Rock 'n' roll guardians now
The last keepers of the light

Forever angels (angels, angels)
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)

Paradise is a hell-colored flame sky
Is it nice to feel free and wild?
Paradise is a game of do-or-die
I just ride, ride, ride

Forever angels (angels, angels)
Forever angels
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)
They were angels forever (forever, forever)
Forever angels (angels, angels)

"Architecture"
(The Next Best American Record Demo)

My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
To the Houses of the Holy, smoking on them cigarettes
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was cool as heck, he was cool as heck

But you were so obsessed with writing
The next best American record
That there was nothing left by the time we got to bed
Baby, that's a shame
You were so obsessed with writing
The next best American record
You did it all for fame
You did it all for fame

You did it all for fame
Tell me how it treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out?
You did it all for fame
Baby, how's life treating you now that it's over?

My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was seventies in spirit, nineties in his frame of mind
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
We lost track of space, we lost track of time

But you were so obsessed with writing
The next best American record
That there was nothing left by the time we got to bed
Baby, that's a shame
You were so obsessed with writing
The next best American record
You did it all for fame
You did it all for fame
You know what I'm talking about

You did it all for fame
Tell me how life treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out?
Now that you lost the game
Honey, how's life treating you now that it's over?
Baby, how you feeling now that I told ya?

It's you, all the roads lead to you
Everything I want and do
All the things that I say
It's true, all the roads lead to you
Like the 405 I drive through
Every night and every day
I see you for who you really are
Why the thousands of girls love the way Bill plays guitar

You did it all for fame
Tell me how life treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out?
You did it all for fame
Honey, how's life feeling now that it's over?
Baby, how's life treating you now that I told ya?
Honey, how's it feeling now that I told you?
Honey, how's it feeling? I told you
Honey, how's it feeling?
Honey, how's it feeling? I told you

You've been pretty stupid
Ever since you got famous

Uh-oh, uh-oh, wrong side
Of the tracks, boy
Uh-oh, uh-oh, if only
We'd go backward

'Cause nobody does it like you
I like the way that you move
That's why I never go through
With leaving you

Everybody's saying that

You bought me dimebags
Felt like we were famous

Uh-oh, uh-oh, best I
Ever had boy
Uh-oh, uh-oh, can you
Remember that, boy?

Nobody knew what we knew
We had it figured out too
Us against the world just
Me and you (ooh-ooh)!

If you wanted heaven, baby
Sit back in my pink Cadillac

Everybody's saying that
You're no good for me
Your friends all swear

You make me cuckoo like a turtle dove
So hot that I can't get enough, enough of you
Hit me and it felt like a kiss
You know it hurts so good, when you do me like this
So sad when I hear the girls talk
When I walk by, I start to cry-y-y

(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause you're a beautiful player
You're a beautiful player, baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that?)
Ooh ooh oh oh, ah, ah, ah
(Sing it to me, doll)

Sunset on a Saturday night
Having a drop-top 'bach-ride time of our lives
He's selling souls on the boulevard of broken dreams
And faded queens
Live young like we oughta die fast
'Cause he's been breaking the law and he's not going back (going back)
I love him violently all through the night
And yes it's true, I live for you-oo-oo

(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause you're my beautiful player
(Sing it to me)
You're my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that?)
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh, oh, yeah

L is for your love that you gave and took away
O is for the only one I wanted to stay
V is for my valiant Valium baby
E is for the X that we took with champagne

I don't wanna leave, I just wanna breathe
I drive 'em crazy, baby girl, just being me
I'm not selfish, I can't help it
I was playing the cards I was dealt-ed
The name Starz got a lot of love to give
Riding down Broke Dream Boulevard in the Benz
How you love that? I think too much
A thin line between insanity and true love

Hit me and it felt like a kiss
Baby if it don't hurt, then I'll have to insist
We have just one life to live
But true love's more than he can give

(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause he's my beautiful player
He's my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that?)
Ooh ooh oh oh, ah, ah, ah

(Sing it to me baby)
'Cause he's my beautiful player
(Sing it to me)
He's my beautiful player baby
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh oh baby
(How you love that?)
Ooh ooh oh oh, oh, oh, yeah

"Because Of You"

On the streets of L.A.
Where the future is now
We dance like nobody is watching us
And we live like we want to
But it can also get a little crazy
Unless there's something to hold on to
For me, that was true love

I was a young girl, selfish and wild
Like a fire in L.A.
Hot like the summer and mean like a child
Who keeps crying 'til she gets her way
(Like a true star)

There were roses in my hair
Rock and roll on blare and I was in trouble
No one could rock me like you could
I was a bad girl gone good

Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
And it brought me to my knees
And it's all because of you
(You know what I'm talking about)

It was a mad world, we lived for fun
And we got shit for free
Had a face like an angel but inside my heart
Was as black as a broke movie screen
(It was pretty sad)

But then I saw you standing there
Like a millionaire, give me your number
Call me before I get stupid
Make me uncrazy like you did

Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
But you brought me to my knees
And it's all because of you

It isn't hard to see you've got a hold on me
Give me your money, love me to death
Talk like a baby cause I'm so elated
He tell me that I ain't seen nothing quite yet
I don't wanna lose it
I'm in love but I didn't choose it

Roses in my hair, dancing in the air
Feels like I'm flying
Tell me you love me, boy, do it
It's just like I thought, I just knew it

Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
You bring me to my knees
And it's all because of you
Yeah, it's all because of you

"Behind Closed Doors"

I like 'em mad, bad baby, you could be the one
If you wanna get trashed and have fun
Throw me wholly in the sky like a pizza pie (Are you crazy?)
You take my whole world, baby, and twist it to the right
Throw me in the air and whoop like dynamite
Baby you know anytime you can swing by

You know I like 'em bad, boy
Wrong side of the track, boy, oh
You know I like 'em bad boy, like you
(Like you, you know I do)
I like a man with kick, yeah
So come around and hit me up
No other man can lick me like you
(Like you, you know what you do)

Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
I'm not gonna do it, baby (no way)
Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
You only show a little but you give me more
Behind, behind, behind
Behind closed doors
(No one can see us)
(I know you like me)

I see my best friends kissing
Touching all the time
But I don't need no jet to write it in the sky
I see it in his eyes, I'm his cherry pie

You know I like 'em bad, boy
They think you make me sad, boy, no
The best I ever had, boy, it's you
(Like you, you know I do)
I want a man that's hot, yeah
To come around and rock me, yeah
No one can dirty talk me
(Like you, you know what you do)

Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
I'm not gonna do it, baby (no way)
Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
You only shout a little but you give me more
Behind, behind, behind
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

Everybody's at the park tonight
Everybody's at the shore
Everybody's on the street tonight
What the hell would we do that for?
Everybody's at the park tonight
But we got fireworks galore, behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
I'm not gonna do it, baby (no way)
Everybody's saying you're no good for me
But they don't see the dirty stuff you do to me
You only shout a little but you give me more
Behind, behind, behind
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors

"Ben"

Ben's song, another try
Not that you deserve it right now, Ben
No faculties to care and all
But I deserve it, I deserve it, I know
(We can quibble over the history once we make it)
Right?

Lie down, my sad executive love, lie down
Right now, my man, bored out of his head, right now
Fans turn on a May night
Darkness assumes the room
Lie back, he does, in the late night
Hands folded back
Certain of doom
Hold me he sang "Hallelujah"
The midnight's became my noon
You don't know what you do, do ya?
I am on fire for you
I'm on fire, I'm on fire

Lie down, my sad executive love, lie down
Right now, my man, bored out of his head, right now
Fans turn on a May night
Darkness assumes the room
Hold me, hmm
Hold me he say "Hallelujah"
The midnight's became my noon
You don't know what you do, do ya?
I am on fire for you
I'm on fire, I'm on fire

Lie down, my sad executive love, lie down
I can smoke if I want to
I can dance if I want to
Yeah, it's true I want you
But don't say you don't want no harm
If you can't understand
'Cause I won't be here long enough for you to be my man

It's not a very nice ending, but that's what you get, just kidding

God bless America
Land that I love
Stand beside her
And guide her
I don't know anything, hm

There you are

"Bentley"

He drive up in a summer sky, blue Bentley
Death reflecting in his eyes
Thought about all the women who loved me
I said, "Oh no!"
He said, "Get inside"
I said, "Oh no!"
He said, "Get inside"

I got into his summer sky, blue Bentley
Sun reflecting in my eyes
Thought about all the fun I had lately
I said, "Uh huh" I said "I want to drive"
I said, "Uh huh I want, I want to drive"
We drive, we drive

You say you wanna go swimming in my ring
It's green and shimmering
Like my lipstick, the color of dawn
Like my lipstick, the color of dawn
We got out of his summer sky, blue Bentley

Death reflecting in the sky
He held my hand to the ocean he lead me
I said, "Uh huh, I want, I want to die"
"Uh huh, I want, I want to die."

"Big Bad Wolf"

I told you not to go into the woods
I told you that he wasn't any good
I told you not to go into the woods
I told you that he wasn't any good

I'll take the wrong path
I think I've gone a little off track
And now there's no way back
You took all the apples that I had

But I heart you and I wanna be your girl
I heart you and I know you'll rock my world

'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up
(I told you not to go into the woods)

Big, bad, naughty rock star
Your claws are shining bright in the dark
Lifting up my little red skirt
I know you'll leave me here in the dirt

But I heart you, and I wanna be your girl
I heart you, so come back and rock my world

'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up

Life is like, like a little game
That we like to play, just for fun, just for fun
Yeah, we take nothing seriously, nothing's wrong, make me run, all night long
Hide and seek is how you play with me
Oh, you're tempting me, just for fun, just for fun
I hear you calling me over city streets, through the trees, mess with me, then you'll leave
Oh, be still my heart, escaping in your cherry-red car

'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up
'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
You know that I want what you got
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up

"Big Eyes"
(from "Big Eyes" soundtrack)

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

I saw you creeping around the garden; what are you hiding?
I beg your pardon, don't tell me "nothing"
I used to think that I could trust you
I was your woman
You were my knight and shining companion

To my surprise
My love's demise
Was his own greed
And lullabies

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

I noticed you got hot in summer
You had no comfort
Your shirt was cotton
Your face was sunburned
You paced around like you'd been waiting
Waiting for something
Your world was burning and I stood watching

As I looked on
The flames grew high
You watched me frown
I said "goodbye"

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

Is it me, was I wrong to have trusted you?
Did I see what I wanted, what wasn't true?
Was I wrong to go on like a little fool?
It's amazing what women in love will do

With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

"Big Spender"
(feat. Smiler)

The minute you walked in the joint
I could see you were a man of distinction, a real big spender
Good looking, so refined
Say, wouldn't you like to know what's going on

I don't pop my cork for every man I see

"Blizzard"

Caught up in a blizzard yesterday
Ought to be alone, or so I say
I needed a change of scenery
She was really starting to annoy me

I went out shopping and planned to go to all them vintage stores
Then I got tired and ended up in some lame department store
And that's okay, cause I found a really cool belt and

I feel like I'm in high school again
Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say
I don't have to be sad like you

I have a commitment Friday night
First I say my prayer then I'm alright
I sit in my chair, you dim the light
When I look I stare with inner sight

I feel like I'm in high school again
Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say
I don't have to be sad like you

Met up with some friends for Thai food
I liked it but wasn't in the mood
Can't you see that I'm just feeling blue?
What I do's got nothing to do with you

I feel like I'm in high school again
Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say
I don't have to be sad like you

"Boarding School"

Everyone from home
Says that you're so cool
Come on, everybody
To the boarding school
Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down
To the boarding school

L-L-Let's do drugs
Make love with our teachers
Come on, date a townie
Let his tattooed ass beat you
I'm a fan of pro-ana nation
I do them drugs to stop the f-food cravings
If you wanna get high with me
I'm in the back doing crack, drinking P-P-Pepsi

Everyone from home
Says that you're so cool
Come on, everybody
To the boarding school
Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down
To the boarding school

Cheap trailer trash and everyone knows it
But she got a great ass and she knows how to show it
With American flags on each little finger
You're crashing on Wall Street
While I'm blowing up as a singer

If you wanna get that scholarship
Yale's not a problem, let's solve it
Educated in the language of doing it
Get down like your tutor taught you to
And do it

Everyone from home
Says that you're so cool
Come on, everybody
To the boarding school
Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down
To the boarding school

If you wanna get that sugar cane
If you wanna be that pin-up queen
You can, you can
If you wanna do that south beach swing
Or go on a groove, vacationing
You can, you can, you can

When they said prolific, they weren't kidding
You thought that I was just a calendar kitten
But now you heard me purring, tiger, you're smitten
So let's begin to major in the art of sinning

Everyone from home
Says that you're so cool
Come on, everybody
To the boarding school
Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down
To the boarding school

Get down, get down

"Bollywood Hawaii"

Every time you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I can't see
He's someone I have never talked about
Cause I know that we'd both be dead if you found out
Every time you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something that I've been withholding
I'm not like every other girl

Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for

So if you begin to think that
My light might be supernatural
I'd have to say you're right
"You're right, mon cher, it is"
I came from a place that your mind can not even imagine
We say "Maha, mahaha, mahaha, maha"
And we sing

Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for

I need your love babe
I need your loving
I need your love babe
I need your loving

"Break My Fall"

The greatest line in history:
Baby it's not you, it's me
What you think I'm dumb, dumb, baby doll?
I'm big enough and bad enough
And I can tell when things get rough
Now nothing that you say can break my fall

Oh, oh
Stop right there
Oh, oh
If you really care

Don't go and blow it all, it's bad enough baby
I don't wanna hear you saying it's not you, it's me
If there's blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you're done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There's nothing you can say to break my fall

Greatest lie in history:
Baby it's not you, it's me
Do you really think I'll buy your bullshit boy?
Ooh-oh-oh-oh
Give a girl her self respect
You haven't gone and hurt me yet
But you know that I'll crumble if you call

Oh, oh
Stop right there
Oh, oh
If you really care

Don't go and blow it all, it's bad enough baby
I don't wanna hear you saying it's not you, it's me
If there's blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you're done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There's nothing you can say to break my fall

Break my fall
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

I'm not gonna let you become a martyr
Not gonna let you pick up the gun
I'm gonna make this a whole lot harder
Won't make it easy for you to run
I'm not gonna let you become a martyr
Not gonna let you pick up the gun
I'm gonna make this a whole lot harder
Won't make it easy for you to run

Don't go and blow it all, it's bad enough baby
I don't wanna hear you saying it's not you, it's me
If there's blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you're done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There's nothing you can say to break my fall
Don't go and blow it all, it's bad enough baby
I don't wanna hear you saying it's not you, it's me
If there's blood on my hands, you should let me know
If you're done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There's nothing you can say to break my fall

"Buddy's Rendezvous"

Everybody's girl
What's the point in
Being everybody's girl?
Maybe you think that way
There's no chance getting hurt
Living for no one cost me way
More than it's worth

So you're gonna be a singer
Well I'll be goddamn
You're as pretty as a postcard
No thank to the old man
It's the same coat I had on
The night that I went in
I can stay an hour at Canter's
The streets cool off by then

When can I see you again?
Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Everything you want
What's the fun in getting
Everything you want?
I wouldn't know but, look
Baby you should try
Forget that lefty shit
Your mom drilled in your mind

Give the world a new savior
Sell his pictures to the press
Buy a place out in the country
Leave this world for
Someone else
My destruction is an hour late
I'm at Buddy's Rendezvous
Telling the losers
And old-timers
How good I did with you
They almost believe me too
Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news
Whatever happened to the girl
I knew?
In the wasteland come up short
And end up on the news

Whatever happened
Whatever happened

"Butterflies"

We're sipping cocktails, looking down upon the riot
You whisper "Baby, love the way you look tonight
I wanna save you, save you from the world outside."
I know it seems you're all I wanted and much more
But then, to tell the truth, I've been through this before
They say "I'll save you, save you", but they never do

I think you know I want to believe you
But in my heart, I know that I'll leave you
It's sort of sad how instincts deceive you, or does it please you?
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you've done makes me wanna run, run

I made the decision that I can't be with you
Walking out the door but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies
I make the decision that I'm too good for you
Then I see you're calling, it's hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies

Well back in high school, in the yard, we used to fight
But you would sneak in through my window every night
"I wanna take you, take you to the world outside"
Well, I assume it's what I wanted at the time (oh, at the time)
But your eyes were like a constant warning sign (oh, warning sign)
"I wanna take you, take you" and I didn't mind

And even then I didn't believe you (no)
You had a smile so easy to see through
I know a little part of me will always need you (yes)
Try to reach you, try to please you (what?)
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you done makes me wanna run, run

I made the decision that I can't be with you
Walking out the door but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies
I make the decision that I'm too good for you
Then I see you're calling, it's hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies

I know, I know, I know, we aren't good together
I can't let go, I'm sure that we should be forever

I look around, there's no one above you
I think you know that I'll always love you
And baby, I'm bad too, it's not just you
But I can't wait forever to trust you
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you've done makes me wanna run, run

I made the decision that I can't be with you
Walking out the door but I already miss you
Thinking about how I used to kiss you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies
I make the decision that I'm too good for you
Then I see you're calling, it's hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I'm getting butterflies, I-I'm getting butterflies

"Butterflies (Part 2)"

You're hot for God, but we all got a hunch that
Maybe you've gone astray
Control yourself, but it's so hard
When you can look so good on Sunday
I know he knows that I knew what he's thinking
I know he knows
I know he knows that what he's doing is wrong
But I just tell him, "Go on, sing a sad song."

My baby has an eye for pretty things, pretty things
He thinks that little girls are butterflies and clips their wings
Sicko, psycho, sicko, but he's my beau
Puts them on a roller coaster, lures them in with Coca-Cola!

Boy, you've been catching butterflies
All the girls believe your lies, don't they?
Boy, you can pin me up if you like
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby
You give me butterflies
You're catching butterflies
You give me butterflies, I'm fluttering, fluttering high

You're hot to trot, but boy, you got a
Secret that you cannot betray
He likes it hot, you're burning up
But baby boy, your secret is safe
I know he know that I knew what he's thinking
I know he know
I know he know that what he's teaching is wrong
But, honey, this preacher's song has got me too far gone

My baby has an eye for girls who sing, girls who sing
He's lucky I'm the type, that's his thing, that's his thing
Sicko, psycho, sicko, but he's my beau
Dresses up in rings and rollers, poses as a Holy Roller!

Boy, you've been catching butterflies
All the girls believe your lies, don't they?
Boy, you can pin me up if you like
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby
You give me butterflies
You're catching butterflies
You give me butterflies, I'm fluttering, fluttering high

His butterflies are in a golden cage, safe and bound
He puts on "Lola" by The Kinks and he dances 'round
And he's so happy that his feet don't even touch the ground
And I'm in love cause I was lost and now I'm finally found

Boy, you've been catching butterflies
All the girls believe your lies, don't they?
Boy, you can pin me up if you like
A pin-up in a lonely sky, baby
You give me butterflies
You're catching butterflies
You give me butterflies, I'm fluttering, fluttering

Fluttering, fluttering
Fluttering, fluttering
Fluttering
(Psycho, sicko, psycho)

"C U L8R Alligator"

Don't say I'll see you later alligator, so cute
When you know it's not true
I know you're seeing her
But you can still see me, too
If you wanted to, baby

I know they say I'm cheap
And you're two-timing me
That's what you get
We're in the 21st century
So much for chivalry
I know you'll come to me
I have a way with men like you, baby

You're all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic's flawed and you've been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your little baby come, oh, come to you
When you gonna let me drive you crazy like nobody do
You're all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know you're scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby?
When you gonna love your baby?

I did the Playboy dip that made us famous
And you was watching there with your crew
I should have known just by the circumstances and who
I was meeting you through
That you were bad news

I know that's not the way
Most people meet but, hey
We're living in the fast lane
Post-modern day
You're not sure you can change
Or get out of the game
You're not the only one
I've heard say, "Maybe."

You're all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic's flawed and you've been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your baby tie you up and drive you crazy?
You're all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know you're scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby?
When you gonna love your baby?

"California"
(unreleased, Honeymoon outtake)

Look at that, I'm walking around like I just don't care
Why is that? Cause baby I don't now that I'm here
Look at me, I'm staying up late in my blue suede shoes
Shake it up, I'm dancing all night to the dirty blues

I like the light that shines on the water
I love the waves that break on the shore
I love the heat, can't get any hotter
And every night we dance, I love you even more

California, land that I love I'm not turning back
California, now that I'm home I'm not going back
California, I'm coming for ya
California, I'm coming for ya

Look at that, I'm walking around like I just don't care
Wildin' out, shaking it off shaking out my hair
I'm leanin' back, leaning so far I'm lyin' in the air
You're the man, and God it feels good just to say that, yeah

Like a dream, you glide on the water
And like a star I shine from the shore
Like the sun, can't get any hotter
You're the one I want, I won't look anymore

California, land that I love I'm not turning back
California, now that I'm home I'm not going back
California, I'm coming for ya
California, I'm coming for ya

He's my happy ending
Where the stars collide
Angels in the moonlight
Only you and I

California, land that I love I'm not turning back
California, now that I'm home I'm not going back
California, I'm coming for ya
California, I'm coming for ya

Boy you look so fine, fine
Boy you look so fine, fine

"Catch & Release"

So, I heard you wanna go to Rio, baby
Yes, I seen page six lately, ah
I told you both them broads was crazy
Hacking in your phone and shit
Diamonds and pearls, your little girl
She got the best, sparkling like a Hollywood movie, ah-ah-ah

If you got the cash, lock it down tight
I got the looks, you got my heart right
And you love me, 'cause I'm just like neon
Lighting up your night

Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
I didn't want nothing from you
Just to be like you, my king

I thought that you wanted a real girl, baby
You lured me in with all your gold
Catch and release, and you're so cold
Are you crazy?
You didn't know what kinda fish you caught
'Cause I am a shark, beware of my bark
I'll eat you up like the center of a tootsie pop

'Cause we were a match in heaven, high
Only one catch, Frank was the boss, right?
And it's so sad, 'cause the only way
That you know how to love is fight

Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
I didn't want nothing from you
Just to be like you, my king

Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
You know how I like my world on a string
You know how I like my world on a string
You know how I like my world on a string

"Caught You Boy"

Everything you do, everything I like
On the radio, dancing in the night
Flowers in my hair, roses on the vine
You can be my guy, and I'm your baby, right?

My, my, apple of my eye
Looking really hot while I make ya cherry pie
Show me what you got, got a sparkle in your eye
You're so high

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

Every way I move, every way you like
Pulling on my dress, holding me too tight
I know we'll probably lose, only got tonight
But I love the way we kiss, love the way we fight

My, my, looking really fly
Like the way the bling on your pinkie ring shine
You spin me really fast and you catch me in the sky
I'm so high

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

I wish I may, I wish I might
Have my one true love tonight
Will you be mine?
Oh hi, looking kinda shy
Cause the way you put your hands on me
Well I, I can barely breathe
Baby boy you make me sigh-igh-igh-igh

I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy

Thunder in the air, trouble on my mind
Hold me in the dark, kiss it all behind
Baby don't be scared, come on honey, smile
Everything is fine now, everything is fine

My, my, talking all night
Laughing really hard and it makes me wanna cry
I love our playing house, love our dressing-up nights
Drinks on ice

I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you, I want you
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
I caught you, I caught you

I caught you boy, I caught you boy
I caught you, I caught you

"Children Of The Bad Revolution"

Take me in your fast car, Mercedes
Kissing on your neck while you drive, he, he
Doesn't care, I'm always on my Blackberry
All the time, all the time, buying into every lie

I'm a flashy little lush, but he thinks I'm really fine
Notorious and wild, takes me where I'm gonna shine
Where the bad boys roll hard, dressing like James Dean
And the vixen starlets feels so good to be

We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Get free

Baby, we are chancers on the scene
Glamour in the gutters, only so RT
Sick graffiti artists and tabloid queen
Mix it up, mix it up
Every 'do you've ever seen

We're acting really tough
Like the world belongs to us
Cause it does, yeah, it must
What we do creates the buzz
Where the bad boys blow smoke
Just like they're James Dean
And the it girls blow kisses
Just like Marilyn

We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Get free

Run for our lives
Break outta the chains
So cutting edge
Create our own games
DJs, rock stars, posers we are
The new politicians
The celebrity editions
And it's so pornographic, then it's tragic
Nothing magic makes us free
To be what we wanna be, wanna be

We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Get free
We're gonna get free, oh

Peace, we can't have it
And we don't want it
Please, you've got habits
And you won't stop it (stop it)

And I threw all your stuff out of my window, and I didn't even blink an eye
Though I do admit that when I called your other bitch, I told a little lie
I told her no matter what no two people were ever happier in life
That part wasn't true, but it felt good to yell and good to hear a little sigh

You make me cry
You make me kill

And we break up
And we get back

And I even deleted your cell
Then I called your bitch
I told her that she got her wish, she shouldn't kiss and tell

I don't wish you well
I hope it all goes wrong

"Cult Leader"

Jim takes me down, he's a fire eater
Before the dawn or the valley shines
Jim takes me down to the river
All the way, past the mines
Girls in nightgowns hold their hands forever
Girls with pink lips cultivate the sound
They watch, we kiss on a bed of roses
As he lays me down

He's a fire eater
He's a cult leader
He's a big believer in anything from the 70's
Said that LSD could be good for me
Lay down, lay down

Makes them believe that there's nothing wrong
Parades me 'round like his fucking daughter
All the way, bow down

He's a fire eater
He's a cult leader
He's a big believer in anything from the 70's
Said that LSD could be good for me
Lay down, lay down

There's no relief, I see you in my sleep
And everybody's rushing me, but I can feel you touching me
There's no release, I feel you in my dreams
Telling me I'm fine

Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you
Won't be waiting on the other side

Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you
Except in my dreams tonight

Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
I don't want to wake up from this tonight
Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
I don't want to wake up from this tonight

Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
I don't want to wake up from this tonight
Oh oh oh oh, ha ha ha ha
I don't want to wake up from this tonight

"Daytona Meth"

It's like a Hollywood movie
The black and white waves sparkling truly
My man likes to watch me while I watch TV
While he's t-t-touching me

I remember vintage green wallpaper
Your criminal arms, I couldn't feel safer
King Creole daddy, chasing that paper
I l-l-love you

Baby you'll never be old in my eyes
With your golden grill true love never dies
We're forever young in paradise
As long as you got the Chevrolet, I will ride
I will ride
I will ride

Baby you know mama never had much money
But I plan on using this face to pay, honey
Give me give me give me give
You're so funny, love you 'til I die

Who's living life like it's the Belvedere
Swinging all night on the crystal chandelier
Bring that velvet Elvis over here

Come on, baby you never know 'til you try
Baby you never live 'til you die
Baby you never love 'til you're mine
C'mon you're mine, you're mine, you're mine

"Disco"

Disco
GoGo dancer so rare
Move down, up slow
Prostitute stare
I do what I like
I just don't care

I am my only god
I am my only god
I am my only god
Now

Black eyes
Short dress
Let's break it down
You shoot and I pose
Polaroid frown
I'll do what you like
I won't make a sound

I am my only god
I am my only god
I am my only god

Icon
Young star
Heroin fiend
Just sit and I'll sing
I'll be your queen
You know how I like
That celebrity type
Poor me

I am my only god
I am my only god
I am my only god

"Dragonslayer"

She is a Spanish seÃ±orita
Her eyes are green and her heart is gold
You have a vision, you'd like to meet her
And so you're walking down that road to the sea

You hear a lot of things about her
Her reputation's widely known
The people talk but that don't matter
Because to you she feels like home
You feel free because

She'll never bring you down
You're hot, then she'll bring you water
She wears a flower crown
She is the people's daughter
She's holy, holy
Maria's prayer, the dragonslayer
She's fighting fire by the sea

She is a Spanish la Lolita
Her eyes are green and her dress is gold
She is a siren, la femme Nikita
Her children young but her soul is old
She feels free

She'll never bring you down
You're tired, she'll bring you water
She'll never leave this town
She is the father's daughter
She's holy, holy
Maria's prayer, the dragonslayer
She's fighting fire by the sea
Maria's prayer, if you should see her
Give her my best wishes for me

Holy, dragonslayer
These troubled waters
They don't mean nothing to you
Patron saint of troubled daughters
Hold your light and you have it true
Because you're holy, you're holy
Holy, holy, you're holy, holy

Mariah's prayer, the dragonslayer
She's fighting fire by the sea
Mariah's prayer, if you should see her
Give her my best wishes for me

"Dreamgirl"

I can be your dream girl
I can be your dream girl

When you wake up to the day
And see the city, dark and gray
You can already see the curtain coming down
Sitting, open up your files
Right click JARs to see her smile
Transfer to your heart, and let the world go 'round
Shoo-wop shoo, baby

I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
When it all gets too much
Darling, I'm soft to the touch
Hush, hush and stop your rushing
I can be your dream girl, baby

iPhone ringing, boss is screaming
On the TV, news streaming
It means nothing to you though, you tune it out
Close your eyes and change the station
Switch the pictures on your wavelength
Put me on your playlist, I'm your favorite song
Shoo-wop shoo, baby

I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
When it all gets too much
Darling, I'm soft to the touch
Hush, hush and stop your rushing
I can be your dream girl, baby

Candlelight burns twice as bright, baby burns half as long
So keep your fire burning, so you always love me strong
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Whoa-whoa
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Whoa, baby
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Whoa-whoa
Shoo-wop, shoo-wop
Whoa, baby

Now it's night time, driving uptown
City's sparkling, but you shut down
So you signal right and turn your engine off
Cars fly by you, stars beside you
Turn that radio inside you
Tune the station that's playing the one you love
Shoo-wop shoo, baby

I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
(Shoo-wop shoo, baby)
I can be your dream girl
I can be your dream girl
When it all gets too much
Darling, I'm soft to the touch
Hush, hush and stop your rushing
I can be your dream girl, baby
I can be your dream girl, baby

"Drive"

I've been out on that open road
You can be my full-time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
You can be my full-time baby, hot or cold

Don't break me down (Me down, me down)
I've been traveling too long (Too long, too long)
I've been trying too hard
With one pretty song (Hmm-hmm)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just drive, just drive
Just drive, just drive

Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life an art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it
Light 'til dark

Don't leave me now (Me now, me now)
Don't say goodbye (Goodbye, goodbye)
Don't turn around
Leave me high and dry (Hmm-hmm)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
I just drive, just drive
Just drive, just drive

You think I'll ever feel different than I do now?
You think I'll ever feel any magic again
You think I'll ever transform into the man
God meant to make when he began?

Hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
I just drive, just drive
Just drive, just drive

"Driving In Cars With Boys"

They say I'm wasting time, they say that I'm no good
Summer of my life, not doing what I should
Call me poison ivy 'cause I'm far from good
But pretty from afar, like a dark star

They think I'm dangerous, they think I'm really bad
I'm just making up for what I never had
Go out every night whenever I feel sad
All this drive-by love got me crazy like a drug

I wear my red lipstick, got my make-up on
Stumble into trouble, siren with a sad song
They all got girlfriends but I'm the one that they want
Miss America with the blue mascara on

I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock 'n' roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know

Mommy's Mercedes or Billy's pick-up truck
Come home late at night and baby picks me up
Tell him just drive on and d-don't ever stop
Don't take me home again, take me to a new land

I wear my red lipstick, grab my coat and gun
Wonder if this is it, it's darkest before dawn
Sometimes I wanna give in but I just have to go on
Miss America now I'm gone, baby, gone

I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding 'round town drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock'n'roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know

I was born to live fast, die young
Leave a beautiful corpse, live my life on the run
I got my cash and my Louis Vuitton, diamonds and guns
Girls just wanna, just wanna have fun

I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding 'round town drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go

I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know

Playing rock 'n' roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know

Knockin' at your door
You thought that you were done
But now you want me even more

I'm a star child, big smile
Livin' in LA
I'm comin' over baby
You can't go to school today

Like the Scarlett O'Hara
Of the downtown scene
'Cause I just wanna dream
I just wanna drink

I'm a pop-blues singer
Fam-bam zinger
Mansfield ringer
From the Hollywood silver screen
Silver screen

Once you've had something
Something so beautiful
You'll never be the same
Once you've had a taste of living my way
You'll be forever changed

I'm a wild child, sky high
Lyin' on your floor
I know I had a lot
But baby, what's a little more
Dum dum
Want a little more

In my white mink
Pink cigarettes from the store
We're making robberies
From Tijuana to the shore
Dum dum
'Juana to the shore
Dum dum

I belong to a bygone era
Like the Bugsy Malone
Of the deep Sahara
'Cause I'm on the scene
Yeah, I'm on the scene

I'm a bad jazz singer
Givin' you the finger
No matter what you linger
'Cause you like me even when I'm mean
I'm the queen

Once you've had something
Something so beautiful
You'll never be the same
Once you've had a taste of living my way
You'll be forever changed

"Dynamite"

French vanilla ice cream
Just the way I like
Dripping on your windscreen
I can't get a bite
Guess we could be more than friends
'Cause this kiss won't end
And you got me trembling

You're dynamite
I'm ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You're dynamite
I'm ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you're a wild thing
Rocking on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you're dynamite

Speeding through the wasteland
Sparkling in the lights
Roll up to the boardwalk
Derelict delight
Eyes all on my dress again
I know how this ends
Boy, you're all adrenaline

You're dynamite
I'm ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You're dynamite
I'm ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you're a wild thing
Rocking on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you're dynamite

He's not like other guys
I can't apologize
For what my body wants
And what my heart decides
O-oh
'Cause I'm so close to the real thing
Yeah, I'm so close to the real thing
I'm so close to the real thing
I could almost die

Say it isn't over
Say it's not goodnight
Maybe we could go somewhere
Start a pillow fight

You're dynamite
I'm ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You're dynamite
I'm ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you're a wild thing
Rocking on my heartstrings

"Earthquakes"

Earthquakes happen regularly down in California
Walls shake, but I don't move, I put the record on and enjoy it
I dance, dancin' in my underwear, I let the 70s rock and roll me
Laurel Canyon, can you feel my power?
Overdose on opium, yeah

Just say I've gone crazy
I don't know what's overcome me
Just say you're my baby, but
I'm feeling tired and I think I'm done, yeah

You can say what you really want
You can say what you really think
Just say goodbye to the sweet Pacific
Goodbye to your lonely queen

Earthquakes happen naturally down in California

"Elvis (Demo)"

Platinum and vale acrylics
Skim the paper for the critics
Baby's breathing Elvis lyrics
On the copper bar
Late in motel lounges singing
Spotlight on the band is swinging
Chateau Marmont memories fading
Hope is very far

Elvis, where are you when I need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my Chantilly lace catching
Baby, on the chandelier

Sweeping scents and blue hydrangea
Summer hail and summer stranger
Baby, he's in constant danger
Help is very far
You look like a Florida native
"Are you?" I said, at the rate of
Slow molasses from the state of
Vermont with a Southern drawl

Elvis, where are you when I need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my Chantilly lace is catching
On the chandelier

He said he'd come to welcome, warn me
Just your diamond to adorn me
Come to be and see the one and only
For my final year
Well, thank you

Elvis, where are you when I need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my Chantilly lace is catching
On the chandelier
It's catching on that chandelier
It's catching on that chandelier
Where are you when I need you most?

"End Of The World"

Why does the sun go on shining?
Why does the sea rush to shore?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
Cause you don't love me any more

Why do the birds go on singing?
Why do the stars glow above?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when I lost your love

I wake up in the morning and I wonder
Why everything's the same as it was
I can't understand, no, I can't understand
How life goes on the way it does

Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye

Why does my heart go on beating?
Why do these eyes of mine cry?
Don't they know it's the end of the world
It ended when you said goodbye

"Every Man Gets His Wish"

You can whistle for it

Baby, you'll never grow old in my eyes
With your golden grill, true love never dies
You wanna watch me while I watch TV
While you're t-t-t-t-touching me
We're forever young in paradise
As long as you got the Chevrolet, I will ride

We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in that Chevrolet from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Every man deserves to see the sunrise

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?

You said I'd never make it out outta here alive
At the rate I was going, I'd be lucky to die
I was born so bad, not naturally right
The brightest star on Hollywood and Vine

We're gonna party like we're running outta time
We're getting drunk and driving fast on cherry wine
Never do belong to anyone I find
Leaving everything I ever knew behind

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
Promised me this
Well, you lied

I learned how to make love from the movies
He found me waitressing at Ruby Tuesday's
He said I wanna buy you a classic white milkshake
I said I'll serve you up a special side of heartbreak
Special side of heartbreak
I was working down in the corner cafe
You drove by in a Chevrolet
Whistle at me as my hips go sway
Lana Del Rey, how you get that way?
How you get that way?
I said, "He loves my heart shaped sunglasses
He loves the heart shape my ass is
Cristal, crystal champagne glasses."

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
Promised me this
Well, you lied

"Fake Diamond"

You're like a fake diamond
Sparkling when the lights are on
But when the nighttime comes
And all the lights go off
You turn off with them
(Where do you go when the lights turn low boy?)
You're like an old film reel
Kissing me when the crowd can watch
But when the velvet falls
And the projector coughs
I can be sure you're gone
(You say it's not true but I know how you do, boy)

I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me

You're like a fake diamond
Sparkling in the moon and sun
You shine like the only one
But when the darkness comes
Baby, you're on the run
(Where do you go when the lights turn low boy?)
You're like my ex-boyfriend
Kissing me when the camera's on
I'm candy for your arm
Look like a debutante
But I'm not what you want
(You say it's not true but I know how you do, boy)

I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me

I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me

Baby I can hold you tight
Let me love you right
In the middle of the night
I don't wanna fight
Give it to me
Sing it to me
Show me the light
(You say it's not true, but I know how you do, boy)

I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me
I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me

"Find My Own Way"

Snow is coming down like rain
I'm at it myself again
A little tired, even more confused
Come on, baby, don't be shy
You can say what make you high
I see the way you be lying, be abused

I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, don't you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
I don't care what you think

Breathing getting fast again
Now I'll start my worrying
When will I learn that there ain't nothing I can do?

Jesus was a dying man
If he can't do it, no one can
When will you learn that we ain't nothing without you?

We don't need anybody when we're down
We don't really find it hard to get around
We'll find our own way back to town
And oh, don't you tell us how we need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
We don't, we don't care what you think

I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, don't you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody but me
And I don't care what you think

"Fine China"

I wore diamonds for the birth of your baby
For the birth of your son
On the same day, my husband-to-be
Packed his things to run
Was bittersweet to say the least
One life begins, one comes undone
I've always been a strong woman of faith
Strong like a tree, but the unlucky one

I'm going down now
With all of my

Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they?
They said that love was enough, but it wasn't
The Earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire, but we were wooden

I wore diamonds for the day of our wedding
For our day in the sun
On the same day, my mother-to-be said she wouldn't come
It's always been that way with me
No time for change, no time for fun
It's always been that way, it seems
One love begins, one comes undone

I'm going down now
With all of my

Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they?
They said that love was enough, but it wasn't
The Earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire, but we were wooden

All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
Blue, ah, blue
All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
Blue, ah

Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they?
They said that love was enough, but it wasn't
The Earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire, but we were wooden

Fine china, fine china, fine china
Fresh linen, fresh linen, fresh linen

"For You"

All these feelings I'm tired of them
Ruling over my life again
Emotions aren't my friend
I keep them ordered as best I can

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Layman, workman, his man, her man
How about about the weather?

All these people I'm tired of them
Sifting into my life again
Their questions, the "how and when"
I try and answer the best that I can but

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Layman, workman, his man, her man
How about about the weather?

All my worries, they come and go
They tend to leave when I let you know
On bad days I take it slow
I try to dance when I hit a low

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man
It will all get better

Oh, the days they go so fast
I can't believe what is in my past
The future's here at last
I don't need to have what she has

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man
It will all get better

Sing it out, sing it loud
Sing it out, sing it loud
Be proud, come out
Be proud, come out

I can, you can, we can do
Can keep it all together
Hit man, burn man, his man, her man
We can make it better, yeah
We will have it better

"Fordham Road"

30 blocks to Fordham Road
That's a bad neighborhood
Crack house on the corner
I know I shouldn't do what it is I could

The stone Mary in the garden
She let me know she watching
She said I better get walking
I better walk away

I don't know why it is that I wanna stay
I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way
But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say
I'm just gonna walk, I'm gonna walk away

I catch a dollar in the wind and I
Buy a cup of coffee
There's a place on Valentine
That still charge ninety cents
I keep on walking in the daytime
And in my eyes, it's always nighttime
And I like it when it's me at night
'Cause that's when all the stars come out
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh

I don't know why it is that I wanna stay
I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way
But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say
I'm just gonna walk, I'm gonna walk away

It's the greatest, it's the greatest day
It's the greatest, it's the greatest day, oh

I'm not gonna do what I hear me say
I'm just gonna walk, I'm gonna walk away

"Freak Like Me"
(Freak Demo)

Flames so hot that they turn blue
Palms reflecting in your eyes, like an endless summer
That's the way I feel for you
If time stood still, I'd take this moment, make it last forever

Your halo's full of fire
I'm rising up, rising up
My hot love's full of fire
Love's full of fire
La, ah

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

Leather black and eyes of blue
Sun reflecting in your eyes, like an easy rider
Life makes sense when I'm with you
Looking back, my past
It all seems stranger than a stranger

So let's dance in slow motion
Tear it up, tear it up
Let's dance by the ocean
Ah, ah

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

Marry me, marry me
Take a long vacation
Money and power and dresses, big standing ovation
Loving you can't be wrong
There's no complications, no

Marry me, marry me
Use all your relations
Carry me, carry me
Fuck our generation
Loving you can't be wrong
Love is our salvation now

Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too

"Golden Grill"

What happened to 'nobody does it better'?
See ya walking 'round like you were born to kill
Driving in your Escalade flash that golden grill
You're picking up a bad habit you get the ones that no one will
Where did your love go babe before you turned criminal?

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way

So here we are, there we go and that's the way
That you gonna roll, that you gonna fight, gonna play
It doesn't really matter to me that you find your way
You've been gone for so long that you're a shell of yourself babe

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way

The sun once shined for you
I've changed my mind for you
Your golden day has turned to night
Your golden day has been denied

There's no more chances for you now, you never learn
You lit my fire baby, but I just got burned

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way

You act like you're gonna live forever
What happen to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing God and get out of the way

"Greenwich"

Hey, back in, ah
Baby, come on

Are you back in Greenwich, dropping acid?
Are you at the Archive, watching television?
Did you leave for Battery with your weed?
And your leather, looking like Ray Gillen?
Are you still the king of rock 'n' roll, babe?
Bet you miss hearing me sing, calling me Lana
And did you take your run today
Along that West Side Highway?
Do you miss your baby mama?
Blue hydrangea
Will my forever love never come back to me?

Does it feel like yesterday to you, yet?
How quickly you forget how I made you smile
I remember everything
The diamond horseshoe, wedding ring, and the tiara
Blue hydrangea
Will my forever love never return to me?

"Hangin' Around"

You'll see me hanging around on the edges of town
I could be bad for you
And honey don't think about chasing this girl around
I could be bad for you

And anywhere you go, I will follow
Even if it's only in spirit, baby
But honey you should go by tomorrow
I predict that shit's gonna get real crazy

Leave while you still can
Before I take you down, take you down
Boy there's still a chance
For you to get out now, get out now

You'll see me hanging around on the edges of town
I could be bad for you
And honey don't think about chasing this girl around
I could be bad for you

And anywhere you go, I will follow
Even if it's only in spirit, baby
But honey you should go by tomorrow
I predict that shit's gonna get real crazy

For you to get out now, get out now

"Hawaiian Tropic"

Hawaiian tropic, dark, and a bottle of jack in the Cadillac
As I drive down the highway
You aren't coming back and I know that now
So I let the wind hit me in my face

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish

Your red Hawaiian shirt and your hair jet black
Hanging 'round with your friends by the track
Baby, you can't come back from being that bad
Just to sit at home, pledge allegiance to the flag

Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone

Copacabana, yes in my party dress
I'm shimmering in love on that crystal meth
A Coca Cola kid, roller coaster child
You my everything, give me that baby doll smile

Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, where is mine?
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, were you lying?

And the velvet Elvis and the rosaries
And your white Corvette under willow trees
You the one for me, my one true king

Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone

I remember party dresses
I remember party dresses

Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
But sometimes it comes too late

"Heavy Hitter"

I was lounging at the Chateau Marmont
Glimmering by the swimming pool
My man walked in like a slow-motion movie
I said, "You're so cool."

I heard a man screaming, "Lights, camera, action!"
I c-c-can't remember what happened
I overdose, you throw me over your shoulder
I was dying, you were screaming
"Open up that Lamborghini."

"Hey Blue Baby"

Hey blue baby
Put that Hank Williams on
It's your little blue baby
Calling for her favorite song
Get out that whiskey
Pour it right quickly
Put them hallway lights on
I hope one day you can remember
Our love before it all went wrong

But the only stars we saw were in the sky
Not the boulevard
And the only thing we wanted was to be free
And the only girl you had eyes for played downtown
At the local bar
That was me
She was me

Hey blue baby
Get that old pickup going
Turn it once, twice, three times
If you love me, oh
Get out that dirt bike
Get on that turnpike
Do what you have to do
Just know your baby's back here waiting
Just know she thinks you're really cool

And the only stars we saw were in the sky
Not the boulevard
And the only thing we need is to be free
And the only girl you have eyes for plays downtown
At the local bar
That was me
She was me

I tell you all the time, get yourself in line
Tired of waiting, tired of crying
I tell you all the time, get yourself in line
Tired of yelling, tired of hollering
You're making me blue, you're making me blue
Making me blue, just do what you do

And the only stars we need were in the sky
Not the boulevard
And the only thing we want is to be free
And the only girl that you love still
Plays downtown at the local bar
Yeah she's me
Yeah she's me

"Hey You"

Do, do
Ah, ah
I said

Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me

He's a walk with the past
Love of the fast
Girls in the fast lane
His knuckles are brass
A heart like a horse
Love of the games, gold in his veins

Met him at the club
Singing my songs
He says, "Are you famous?"
I was once
A b-movie actress
Has been, but never was
He knows that it's love

He saw me on stage
Pointed my way
The look of desire, all on his face
I gave him the eye
And took my place
I could tell that he'd be mine by daytime

Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can't stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me

He's a man with a cast
Cane and a glass
Rim full of champagne, looking for class
A mind like a steel cage
Soul full of rage
Tactical nature so they call him insane

Met him at the club
And from that night on
He called me his princess, right on!
I'm his little ex-beauty queen
Never going back to where I've been

Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can't stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me

No one can save me
Oh, do, do, woah
When did I ever care
What they said about our love, my baby
My baby boo

Yo, our friends think it's sad
Living so bad
I'm always crying
He's always mad
Our life is a mess
Oh it's a shame
"What did they see in each other?" they say

I met him at the club
And from that night on
Called me his princess, right on!
I'm his little ex-beauty queen
Never going back to where I've been

Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can't stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can't stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me

No one can save me
No one can save me

Let's hit it and run
Hit it and run the world
Hit it and run
Baby, hit it and run
Hit it and run the world

You and me on a spree taking over
L. Del Rey (yay) wanna be your soldier
Hit it and run
Baby, hit it and run
Hit it and run the world

"Hollywood"

One day, my hoops will be made of diamonds
My knuckles made of real gold
I'll spend my days getting high with all my friends
In the glamorous and green old part of Hollywood

Sun will rise, I'm a supernova
Body electric and I dance like Morrison
When the night begins, baby comes alive again

In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
I'm alive again
I'm alive again

One day, I'll drive in a gold Mercedes Benz
Singing opera on Bel Air Road
Hair to my ass will be flying in the wind
Shooting heroin and speedballs

See the sea, I'm a supernova
I walk on water and I dance like Joplin
When the sun descends, I dive into the waves again

In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
I'm alive again
I'm alive again

Oh-oh, oh-oh, c-can you see me?
Whoa-oh, my heart beating fast
I can feel it chasing in the speed-lights
I was built to last
Whoa-oh, c-can you feel that?
Ah-ah, ah-ah, my heart shaking fast
I can feel that you're the one for me
You'll be my first, and you'll be my last

In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
I'm alive again
I'm alive again

I'm alive again
I'm alive again

"Hollywood's Dead"

Our kind of love
It was once in a lifetime
It couldn't last
It was doomed from the first time
And you
Were '50s cool
In blue suede shoes
But it was a cover for all of the trouble
You got into

I always fall for the wrong guy
Things that are bad always taste nice
That's what girls like me do, lose you

Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Vicious in flames
Roland is dying
And in the light, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful

This kind of life
Wasn't meant for the good girl
Try as I might
In the end, it's a cruel world
And you
Are living proof
Sinatra aloof
But you were an actor who only went after
The ones who swooned

I always fall for the same type
Gangsters in Vegas on game night
That's what girls like me like, the limelight

Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Marilyn's sad
Hendrix is lying there
In the light, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful

If you should go before me, then know
That I always loved you
There's no one above you, babe

Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Lennon, wake up
Cobain, stop lying there
In the light, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodnight, you're so beautiful

Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead, yeah
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead, yeah

You shot, shot, shot, shot, shot
An arrow through my heart now I want you a lot

Jimmy pulls up in his blue Chevy Nova
I have been dying for him to come over
I'm in my party dress, he say "You such a mess"
I am the New Jersey Dance Queen
He is the gangster action king
He knows that I be selling the body
My man the best 'cause he knows what's up

He understands the sale of self

I am the trailer park darling, he is the one-time come-back king
He knows that I be looking to die
He says, baby, pay respect to the high

He knows it's a big bad world, knows that I'm a good girl
He understands the sale of self
Cause cash comes quick when looks can kill

Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill

"I Can Fly"
(from "Big Eyes" soundtrack)

I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

I had bright wishes in the summer, I was bathing in sunlight
Painting in the garden like a ghost in mid-July
Running fast from something with my eyes wide like
Saucers spinning in the sun

I had a dream that I was fine
I wasn't crazy, I was divine

I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

Your lies were hot kisses in the summer
I was dreaming of a lake
Dreaming of the water where I'd rise like a phoenix
Or an iron from the fire
I've got things to tell you like I know that you're a liar

I had a dream that I was fine
I wasn't crazy, I was divine

I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

Your words cut like a knife in butter
I was fighting for my art
Fighting with my lover, you had me so tied up
Thinking there's no other
Yeah, right
Yeah, right

I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly

"I Don't Wanna Go"

He don't like no small things
Even riding 'round on tall dreams
I don't wanna go
He's a sweet baby, but he looks mean
In his soft leather and his blue jeans

He got a way, oh, baby, he got a way, oh, baby
He got a way with his words
They be like diamonds and pearls
They be like diamonds and pearls
He gives to his little favorite girls

I don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

He don't like no spotlight
Stands real quiet in the moonlight

He got a way, oh, baby, he got a way, mm, baby
He got a way with those words
They be like diamonds and pearls
They be like diamonds and pearls
He gives to his little favorite girls

I don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

Loving you isn't right
Black leather moonlight (I give in)
Loving you isn't right
It's original sin

I don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
Baby, tonight
Baby, tonight

I feel like I can do anything
Like I can do anything
Like I can do anything that I like
I feel like I can do anything
Like I can do anything
Like I can do anything
Tonight
Baby, tonight
Tonight

"I Must Be Stupid For Being So Happy"

Well I must be stupid for feeling so happy
I must be crazy for calling you mine
My life's like a movie but I just let it move me
So slow like a two-step, you hold me real tight

All my friends say my lifeâs
Like a bad country song
I just smile, say "I know, but I like to sing along"
For the sweet wedding days
I just put Hank Williams on
I must be stupid for feeling so happy
But they can call me what they want

They think I'm crazy but I keep laughing
They think I'm funny for wearing a smile
But itâs just in my nature and it's just how you move me
Real slow like a movie and I wanna rewind

All my friends say my life's
Like a bad country song
I just smile, say "I know, but I like to sing along"
For the sweet wedding days
I just put Hank Williams on
I must be stupid for feeling so happy
But they can call me what they want

Ah, la, la
Ah, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
I must be stupid for feeling so happy
But they can call me what they want

"I Still Love Him"

And I remember when I met him, it was so clear that
He was the only one for me
We both knew it, right away
And as the years went on, things got more difficult -
We were faced with more challenges
I begged him to stay
Try to remember what we had at the beginning

He was charismatic, magnetic, electric and everybody knew it
When he walked in every woman's head turned, everyone stood up to talk to him
He was like this hybrid, this mix of a man who couldn't contain himself
I always got the sense that he became torn between being a good person and missing out on all of the opportunities that life could offer a man as magnificent as him

And in that way I understood him
And I loved him
I loved him, I loved him, I loved him
And I still love him
I love him

"I Talk To Jesus"

One, two
One, two

I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
What the fuck happened here?
I guess what they meant when
They paid the price
I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
Where are the trailer parks?
And where all the Christmas lights?

I had a boyfriend
He came from this town
We used to pretend we were married and start again
He read the Bible
Showed me what Jesus said
He said I should rewrite (He only read the red)

I want Jesus to take me out this life, baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
Nothing looks familiar here
No one even that I like
I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
I was so much happier when I was gonna be your wife

We had a deal and
I fucked it up when
I made the decision to become someone
We had the one thing that no one ever had
True love
It's true love

I ask Jesus to take me out this life baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

I never meant to hurt you baby
It's so hard to be true
In this world where everything's so black and blue
I never meant to hurt you darling
It's so hard to be good
In this world where you do what you know you shouldn't

I want Jesus to take me out this life baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

"I Want It All"

Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?

I'm the national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on", he said "Yes, yes, yes..."
(Of course we can, my darling)

And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on the stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact kiss, kiss

I sing the national anthem
While I'm standing over your body, hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron
He says to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real
Don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
(Yes, of course I will my darling)

And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on the stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs, and our love, and our dreams, and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well
I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel

Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

I'm the national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of sweetness and danger
Queen of Saigon
He says to be cool and I know he means it
He's loving my look
And I'm loving all his strategic ways
I said "do you think you'll kill for me one day?"
(Yes, of course I will, my darling)

And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on his stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
I'm your national anthem, national anthem
I'm your national anthem, national anthem

"I Was In A Bad Way"

Wait, wait, for me
Wait, wait, wait, for me
Come on, baby

I was in a bad way, honey
'Til I met you
I was in a bad place, honey
I need you

I was going nowhere fast, you were bringing me down
I wanted to go, you were the cutest guy in town

Wait, wait, wait, for me
I don't wanna go
Wait for me
I wanna go, I wanna go
Wait for me
I wanna go

I was in a bad way, honey
I was in a bad way, I was in a bad way

Bring it on punk, you know that I want it
I'm not a bad girl but when I go to clubs, I want to flaunt it
I feel like, you're Superman, and I'm not
It's on your terms, we can waste all my time
Because I want you, I want to go with you
Don't leave me here, I want to go with you

Can I be your baby doll, my my
Can I be your cherry pie
Why do all the best girls like bad guys
Cause they're to die for

I know what they say about you, you know that I never care
You were always my type with your dark heart and your long, black hair, yeah
Baby, I wanna take you higher, higher
So let me, so let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me love you
Let me love you, let me love you

I don't wanna go
Take me with you
I don't wanna go away, no
Take me with you

I need you, I want you, you know that

"If I Die Young"
(AKA "On & On & On")

All the roses are red and Jupiter, too
I'm lying in my nightgown making confessions to you
It's all over now, baby blue
All my secrets are out
I told them all to you

And it's a little grim
But I sing a hymn only for you
I seal it with a kiss
And it goes like this
"Baby, love me too"

If I die young, let me die in California
And when I'm gone, let 'em play my favorite song
It's Jimmy Buffet
To remember life's a beach, baby, enjoy it
When I'm done, let the music play on
And on and on and on
Go on and on and on

All my stories are out
All the lies are out, too
When we drive in the nighttime
I lift them up to you

And it's a little grim
But I sing a hymn only for you
I seal it with a kiss
And it goes like this
"Baby, love me, too"

If I die young, let me die in California
And when I'm gone, make 'em play my favorite song
It's Jimmy Buffet
To remember life's a beach, baby, enjoy it
When I'm done, let the music play on
And on and on and on
Go on and on and on

Be my baby (Ohh)
Be my baby, tonight
We'll go on and on and on
Be my baby (Oh oh oh oh oh)
Be my baby, tonight
Go on and on and on

It's a little grim
But I sing a hymn only for you
I seal it with a kiss
And it goes like this

We'll go on and on and on
Be my baby (Mmm)
Be my baby, tonight
Go on and on and on

"In The Sun"

Everybody said that it wasn't love
I was dumb
I was getting high on your sugar rush
For too long
You told me that we could have it all
Now you're posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, what the hell?
We were in heaven then we fell
I believed you, said I'd never leave you
I-

I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Living with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now you're posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, having fun, having fun

Everybody said, "Careful of that guy"
Baby couldn't stop, it was suicide
Headed for a cliff, eyes open wide
You were feigning love by holding tight
But I need you, don't want to, but need to
I-

I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Living with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now you're posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, having fun, having fun

You been messing around with my beating heart
You should be ashamed
Boy, you never loved me from the start
Such a wicked game
I told you I needed somebody
I never used you for love or for money, boy
I feel like I can't trust nobody
Beat on my heart and you left it all bloody, now

I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Living with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now you're posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, having fun, having fun

"In Wendy"

Well, dark clouds they'll subside for awhile
And sit down, I can make my friends smile
I have lost a lot but I'm sane, you know
And I'm calling you up just to say hello, so
Hi, my lovely, hi, my lovely
I am someone else

I did think I would live life alone
I was sure I was made out of stone
I have lost a lot but you helped me find
What was really real and some peace of mind
And I'm awfully thankful and I am so grateful
I need no one else

Will you think of me when I am gone?
Will you comfort me when I am wrong?
I have a lost a lot but I'm feeling fine 'cause I
Finally found out nothing's mine and I'm
Only human, I'm so human
I am nothing else

"Is It Wrong?"

I guess it's symptomatic of a slight infatuation
Stalking you has sorta become like my occupation
Used to be a beauty queen with simple acquisitions
Met my local rock star now I'm having visions

I fell for you, you like me too
Let's get it on, check one, two
I fell for you, you want me too
Let's get it on

Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
I'm making out with you while you're singing your song
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
You're playing your guitar and it's turning me on
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walking around like you don't care
You got me in the back of your car like a star
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If it's wrong, I don't wanna be right

I get so systematic in this kind of situation
I need it, have to have it, t-take over, domination
Used to be so simple, never wanting, never wishing
Now I'm hooked on fame and I'm a girl on a mission

I fall for you, it's all for you
Let's get it on, check one, two
I fall for you, it's all for you
Let's get it on

Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
I'm making out with you while you're singing your song
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
You're playing your guitar and it's turning me on
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walking around like you don't care
You got me in the back of your car like a star
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If it's wrong, I don't wanna be right

A funny little thing about love is that you're blind all the time
And even when you think you had enough
You're wanting more, it isn't right but
You can't stop

You got your eyeliner, long hair, walking around like you don't care
You got me in the back of your ca-ca-ca-car-r-r
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walking around like you don't care
You got me in the back of your ca-ca-ca-car-r-r
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If it's wrong I don't wanna be right

"Jesus Is My Boyfriend"

He's Jesus Christ
And I'm his babydoll
I'm his favourite human but he saved them all

He's my personal saviour
He's my personal saviour

Jesus is my boyfriend
Jesus is my boyfriend
Jesus is my boyfriend
Jesus is my boyfriend

He's my personal saviour
He's my personal angel
My God thinks I'm smashing
He thinks I'm fine
My God takes me dashing cross the party line

He's my personal saviour
He's my personal saviour
My God treats me special
Gives me lots of things
I had some of his boyfriends offer diamond rings

He's my personal saviour
He's my personal saviour

He's my personal angel
He's my cherry pie
Said to call him "Dick Chasey"
He's my private eye
When I get in my gown
He comes to me in the night

"JFK"

You smell like a million roses
Bathed in rock 'n' roll
Ours was the greatest
Love story ever told
Throat like an angel with a voice that was made of gold
That's my baby

He was the king of the town
With a crown that would never fall
A heart that would beat
Like a bass for his baby doll
One in a million, inimitable soul
That's my baby

Young or old, summer or cold
Young or old, summer or cold

You've got a way
Like JFK when you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart, and it drives me crazy

He was the king of the town
With a crown that would never fall
A heart like a bass that would beat for his baby doll
Mind like a diamond
An un-imitable song
That's my baby

Young or old, summer or cold
Young or old, summer or cold

You've got a way
Like JFK when you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart, and it drives me crazy
It drives me crazy

You've got it
And I want it
Late summer nights in July, flaunt it
You know that you can always come home
To the one who gave you your name
'Cause I see a light in your eyes
It's so bright, and
The skies, they open wide for you
So come to me, my baby

You've got a way
Like JFK when you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart, and it drives me crazy

It drives me crazy
It drives me crazy
Crazy, oh, oh-oh

"Kinda Outta Luck"

I was born bad, but then I met you
You made me nice for a while
But my dark side's true
You never cared what I did at all
Motel singer or the silver pole
I did what I had to do

Femme fatale, always on the run
Diamonds on my wrist
Whiskey on my tongue
Before I get bad, I gotta get drunk
So get over here
Pour me a cold one

Babe, you can see that I'm danger
Teetering off of the stage, yeah
Sparkling in sequins, say, hey-yeah
Time to give in to the kindness of strangers

Is it wrong Mom that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck
Is it wrong Mom that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck

Wrong, I know, killing someone
It gets a little easier when you've done it once
You know that I'm fun, you know that I'm young
So tell me you're mine
Let's get it on

Babe, you can see that I'm dangerous
Glamorous, but I'm deranged, yeah
Teetering off of the stage, yeah
I said it really nicely, so can you be my savior?

Is it wrong Mom that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck
Is it wrong Mom that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck

I was a dangerous girl
You were too nice for this world
And now I'm back on the prowl
Who wants to give it a whirl?

Is it wrong Mom that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck
Is it wrong Mom that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck

"Lake Placid"

He don't like no spotlight
He the kinda man, stand real quiet
He don't wanna go, go home
He don't wanna go, go home

He's a sweet baby, but he looks mean
In his soft leather, and his blue jeans
He don't wanna go, go
He don't wanna go, go, go

You are just an American boy, you got your youth and you got your dreams
You ride your Harley like there's nothing to lose, you got the wind, but you're not free

And you don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
We don't wanna go, go home
Baby tonight
Baby tonight

He don't like no small things
He be riding round on some tall dreams
He don't wanna go, go home
He don't wanna go, go home

Hollywood sun, small town things
Probably he's changed, that's why he drinks
He don't wanna go, go home
He don't wanna go, go home

He was just an American kid, liked rock and roll and wanted to have fun
He felt the same way all of us did like probably he was the only one

And you don't wanna go, go home
I won't wanna go, go home
We won't wanna go, go home
Baby tonight
Baby tonight

I was just an American girl, I was reaching for the sun
I never really had big dreams when I saw you, were my only one
And I don't wanna go, go home
I don't wanna go, go home
Baby tonight
Baby tonight
Baby tonight
Baby tonight

"Last Girl On Earth"

Baby has a broken heart
She can't belong to only one
Until another girl is found
I don't pay for anything
My cigarettes or diamonds rings
My feet don't even touch the ground

Chariots of gold, I ride with Jay-Z, Jared Leto
I'm a superpower, now they call me the tornado
I got roses in my hair, I belly dance, and do the tango
Sometimes I get lonely, everybody told me no

No one lives forever, but that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on

Cleopatra used to rule
But she got nothing on me now
'Cause I'm the last girl on earth
I turn the television on
They only play my favorite song
Since I'm the last girl on Earth

Chariots of gold, I'm sitting, sipping cherry cola
Caesar said he'd fall in love with me if I was older
I own all of Mexico and I got my own roller-coaster
Sometimes I get lonely, millions can hold me now

No one lives forever, but that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on

I stay up late at night, try not to think about it
Pretend I'm happy, ruling all the world without love
I get so tired being on display somehow
Sometimes I get lonely, but millions all know me now

No one lives forever, but that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?
There's no such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on

"Let My Hair Down"

You make me wanna let my hair down, man

"Life Is Beautiful"

Don't be that way
Don't you pretend
You're not awake
When you know you are
I see the way
You're lying there
I know you can't
Be very far

God wouldn't do that
He knows how I feel
I can't go through that
And so it's not real

Life is still so beautiful
Life is still so beautiful

Don't be so still
You never are
You like to play
Your soul's on fire
I don't believe this is the end
And I still feel your heart's desire

God couldn't do that
He knows you belong
To me and me only
And so I'll be strong

Life is still so beautiful
Life is still so beautiful

Come on, boy, let's go
We can hit the road
We don't have to say
Where we're going
We can go anywhere
We can go anywhere
We can go anywhere
Right now

Life is still so beautiful
Life is still so beautiful

"Lift Your Eyes"

You should have let me know
That I had no chance at all
I can never be what you wanted
Should have let me know
That you're still thinking about her
Should've told me you was on it

Sometimes I wonder why
Why I even bother
Trying to pull you out, boy
Should have let me know
I would lose you to the drink

Lift your eyes, lift your eyes
Just a little higher, just a little higher
Lift those eyes, look into mine
Cause I can guide ya, I can guide ya
Lift those eyes, lift your eyes
I know that you're scared to death
Running out of breath
But I can hold you, hold you

You should have let me know
That you worked around the clock
Could have tried a little harder, yeah
You should have let me know
That you were afraid to love me
Afraid of looking like a liar

Sometimes I wonder why
Why I even ask you, but I do

Lift your eyes, lift your eyes
Just a little higher, just a little higher
Lift those eyes, look into mine
Cause I can guide you, I can guide you
Lift those eyes, lift your eyes
I know that you're scared to death
Running out of breath
But I can hold you, hold you

"Looking For America"

Took a trip to San Francisco
All our friends said we would jive
Didn't work, so I left for Fresno
It was quite a scenic drive
Pulled over to watch the children in the park
We used to only worry for them after dark

I'm still looking for my own version of America
One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly
No bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind

I flew back to New York City
Missed that Hudson River line
Took a train up to Lake Placid
That's another place and time, where
I used to go to drive-ins and listen to the blues
So many things that I think twice about before I do now

I'm still looking for my own version of America
One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly
No bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind

It's just a dream I had in mind

"Lust For Life (BloodPopÂ® Remix)"
(feat. The Weeknd)

There's nobody here, just us together
Keeping it hot like July forever

'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
There's no way for us to come, wait
'Cause boy we're gold, boy we're gold
And I was like

Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all of your clothes

They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight, yeah

And a lust for life (and a lust for life)
And a lust for life (and a lust for life)
Keeps us alive (keeps us alive)
Keeps us alive (keeps us alive)
And a lust for life (and a lust for life)
And a lust for life (and a lust for life)
Keeps us alive (keeps us alive)
Keeps us alive (keeps us alive)

'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
So there's no need for us to hesitate
We're all alone, let's take control
And I was like

Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all of your clothes

They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight, yeah

And a lust for life
And a lust for life

We dance on the H of the Hollywood sign
'Til we run out of breath, gotta dance 'til we die
My boyfriend's back and he's cooler than ever
There's no more night, blue skies forever

And a lust for life (and a lust for life)
And a lust for life (and a lust for life)
Keeps us alive (keeps us alive)
Keeps us alive (keeps us alive)
And a lust for life (and a lust for life)
And a lust for life (and a lust for life)
Keeps us alive (keeps us alive)
Keeps us alive (keeps us alive)

"Lust For Life (Demo 3)"

One foot in the door
I've been trying
To get your attention
Is it working out yet?
Love me or love me not
I don't care anymore
But baby, I've been dying
To get your attention
And I was like

Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
They say only the good die young
That just ain't us
Plus you're having too much fun
You're not in a rush

But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive

My boyfriend's back and he's cooler than ever
There's no more night, blue skies forever

One day or one night
I've been trying
To make a connection
Is it working or not?
Love me or love me not
I don't care anymore
Cause babe I've been dying
To taste your affection
And I was like

Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes

Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes

They say only the good die young
That just ain't us
Plus you're having too much fun
You're not in a rush

But it's funny how some things just change in a day, or even in an hour
I'm like a wild caged animal, lying by the swimming pool, losing all my power
It's funny how my life just stopped and shifted from meeting you as a stranger
Now I'm like a wild caged animal, lying by the swimming pool, trying to avoid danger

But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive

Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes

They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight

But it's funny how some things just change in a day, or even in an hour
Now I'm like a wild caged animal, sitting by the swimming pool, losing all my power
It's funny how life can change or be shaped passing by a stranger
Now I'm like a wild caged animal, lying by the swimming pool, trying to avoid danger

But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive

It's funny how some things just change in a day, or even in an hour
I'm like a wild caged animal, sitting by the swimming pool, losing all my power
It's funny how life can change or be shaped passing by a stranger
Now I'm like a wild caged animal, lying by the swimming pool, trying to avoid danger

But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive

"Madly"

I was off the coast of Havana Maria
Broke like I always wanted
You were hopped up, getting drunk on sangria
Drunk like you always wanted
Couple crazy kids but by the physical
I think you're crazy, bitch, but purely musical

Swim across my blue lake
Come into my boathouse
Eat my birthday cake
Take all your clothes off

I don't want your cherry
I just want you very badly
I don't wanna marry you, just wanna be your darling
I don't wanna fall in love, just wanna make you happy
Let me love you more, more, more
La, la, la love you madly

We can go down, pray to Santa Maria
Fuck what I've wanted and followed
Somewhere far on the road near Virginia
Life like I always wanted
Feel like I first did
We're fucked on the physical
It's just the way life is
I don't know what I want

Swim across my blue lake
Come into my boathouse
Eat my birthday cake
Take all your clothes off

I don't want your cherry
I just want you very badly
I don't wanna marry you, just wanna be your darling
I don't wanna fall in love, just wanna make you happy
Let me love you more, more, more
La, la, la love you madly

Madly, madly, madly, madly, madly, madly, madly, madly, madly
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah, yeah, yeah
Let me love you madly, madly
Madly, madly, madly, madly, madly, ah
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah, ah
Madly, madly, ma- madly
Love you madly

"Maha Maha"

Every time that you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I can't see
He's someone I have never talked about
'Cause I know that we'd both be dead if you found out

Every time you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something I have been withholding
I'm not like every other girl

Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for

So if you begin to think
That my light might be supernatural
I'd have to say "You're right, you're right, mon cher, it is"
I come from a place that your mind cannot even imagine
Where we sing "Maha, maha, maha, maha"

Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, mahi, mahi, Yoha, yoho
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for

Maha, oh Maha
Oh Maha, Maha
I give my loving, I'm your devoted
I'll give my love, babe
I'm your devoted

Maha, Maha, Maha, Maha
Maha, Maha, Maha

"Making Out"

Hiya honey
What ya doing?
I been hula-hooping waiting for you, aah
Whoa haters, fakers, mass-manipulators
Don't know what you're trying to prove
I'm the New York City queen queen
You should hear me sing sing
Baby I'm the real thing, check one two
Stop looking at my train-wreck life and start
Listening to the way I sing the blues

You know, I know what they say about me
I know that they think I'm danger
So what if it makes me happy, happy, happy?

It doesn't really matter what you say
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Baby you can't stop me, stop me, now
When I'm hot, I'm hot

"Hiya honey
How's it going?
Saw you skipping up on TV looking blue aah
You're shaking, making music and you're famous
Deep down you're the same girl I knew"

She said, I know what they say about you
I know that they think you're crazy
I know that they are mistaken, baby, baby

It doesn't really matter what they say
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Baby you can't stop me, stop me, now
When I'm hot, I'm hot

Singing for the gangsters
Chasing all that paper
Living life so dangerously
And there's nothing for my anger
Money is my savior
I can be whatever I think
It's like heaven, heaven
Living on the edge never knowing where I'm going to be
And I am dreading, never settling down
That's when dying is beginning to please

It doesn't really matter what you say
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Honey you can't stop me, stop me, now
When I'm hot, I'm hot

"Match Made In Heaven"

(Sing that shit, girl)

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

I'm not a trick but I'm a trick for you

What I'll never do, I really fell for you
You give me butterflies, heart skipping one, two

I, I, I, gotta get it started
I want it bad, bad, I want it bad

I know you're sick, boy, I wanna get the flu
I'm running temperatures thinking of your love, boo
Dizzy spells, ooh, is your love true?
I'm under influence, getting hot and chills too

My local rock star, the Willie B. crew
You out there on the grind
Now come home to your queen, boo

I, I, I, gotta get it started
I want it bad, bad, I want it bad

You're number one, boy, no one else will do
I'm like a prize fighter, clocking chicks to get to you
This race I run for you, won't stop until I'm through
I'm out there doing shit that I should never ever do

I, I, I, gotta get it started
I want it bad, bad, I want it bad

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

Down on your knees, begging me, please
I am your queen, oh-ah

Don't wanna trip but I could fall for you
Heaven is a place called earth on your arm, ooh

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

Sweet neighborhood
Love, dreams made of
It's a match made in heaven
If they're gonna talk, let 'em

"Meet Me In The Pale Moonlight"

Understand this, I'm not looking for true love tonight
If you wanna be my little baby
You can meet me in the pale moonlight
I been working every day 8 to 9 and
Serving coke and fries at the movie blue drive-in
If you want me, you know where to find me

I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby

Understand this, I been liking you since I was small
I don't wanna get you running scared
When there's no pressure there at all
I been working 8 to 9 every day
And think about you almost all the time, all the time and
If I wanna see you, I drive by

I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby

I'm the sweetest girl in town so why are you so mean?
When you gonna ditch that stupid .... you got?
It's me you should be seeing

Hello-o-o you are looking so fine, so fine
Fantasy about you's like a gold mine, gold mine
Asking everybody, "Is he mine? Is he mine?"
Not quite yet, but I'm gonna get-get him
Not quite yet, but I'm gonna get-get him!

I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don't wanna care tonight, I don't wanna fight
You don't have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby

"Melancholia"

If it was the New York Times, they'll say that I'm dead
And if it's Rolling Stone, they'll say I'm uninviting
I don't really give a fuck, it's no surprise
I never had friends here either
Still I'm on a run with the light in my eyes
And if you did it wouldn't happen either

Sometimes bad things happen to good people
And sometimes angels touch pure evil
That don't mean they stop
They can fight for what's right and I will
'Cause I don't have the time to kill
And I, I don't have the will

If you see the light in my eyes, know I'm shining
I walk my road alone 'til here, so I'll keep writing
I don't need your love, I've been this far down
Back into the New York City
I've been sober for eleven years right now
If that don't mean a thing, well, I try

Sometimes bad things happen to good people
And sometimes angels touch pure evil
And I won't stop, I won't fight
I'll just stray towards the light
'Cause I know sometimes bad things happen to good people
And that's mine

Jesus, walk with me
I don't have anything I can offer up to you
But Jesus can comfort me
I don't really wanna drink, some pot will do
Heaven is on Earth
I have peace and that's more than you
I can live in the light like a maniac
In the stars attack, in the zodiac

So ride for the first time and die for the last time
I'm with the angels and I'm stressed in the back row
Keeping me harder, I try and I start
But I'm scared I won't catch up and it don't matter

Sometimes bad things happen to good people
And sometimes angels touch pure evil
And I will fight for the right
To keep on making art out of my life
Fight for the right to be different
In a world full of fake bitches

"Methamphetamines"

Methamphetamines, pink flamingo
Blue 50's queen, blue oyster cove
For the big dream, why don't we go
To Coney Island?
When the hour numb the guy lies on
The record spins blue '50s song
The veranda looks ocean now
Neon palms sway
What's happening? Where did we go?
The Jersey Shore was long ago
As with our hopes and ocean grove
And so I bid you farewell

"Midnite Dancer Girlfriend"

"Money Hunny"

Have you ever seen a dead man?
A dead man lying in the road

Before you get fined

In his one-line plea, in his dull-edged knife

"More Mountains"

I top every mountain there's a hurdle in the sky
When at last you've found them you will understand as I
There is no solution
Life is without resolution

You must ask yourself what you really want in life
You must trust in me when I tell you it's alright
It's alright tonight
It's alright tonight

I remember New Year's that your everything seemed right
We had not made plans and we just drove all the whole night
Let's all go find a friend
Don't stop until the end

You must ask yourself, am I really the one?
You can't be of help if you can't have any fun
I'm your one if you want me to be
Please leave me be
Who are you to say a soul won't live forever
Yeah, yeah

Atop every mountain there's a hurdle in the sky
When at last you've found them you will understand as I
Each breath is sent from angels
These people, they are not strangers

You must ask yourself what you really want in life
You must trust in me when I tell you it's alright
It's alright tonight
It's alright tonight

"My Best Days"

Even my best days without you
Were nothing in comparison to my worst days
Once I had found you
Once I had you
I had everything
I had everything
I had everything
Please don't leave
It's all happening

When I was sleeping without you
Haunted by the baddest dreams
I asked you beside me
I have you, yes I have you
Smiling in your sleep
You would talk to me, in my wildest dreams
I never knew I'd find somebody like you
Like you
Like like
I'd find somebody like you
Like you
Like you

When I was sleeping without you
Haunted by the baddest dreams
At last you're beside me
I have you, yes I have you
Smiling in your sleep
Pillow talk to me
In my wildest dreams
I never knew I find somebody like you
Like you
Like like
I find somebody like you
Like you
Like you

"National Anthem (Music-Video Version)"

Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday to you
Happy Birthday, Mr. President
Happy Birthday to you
Thanks, Mr. President
For all the things you've done
The battles that you've won
The way you deal with US Steel and our problems by the ton
We thank you so much
Everybody

Money is the anthem
Of success
So before we go out
What's your address?

I'm your National Anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons
Bugatti Veyron

He loves to romance them
Reckless abandon
Holdin' me for ransom
Upper echelon

He says to "be cool" but
I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on?"
He said, "Yes, yes, yes"

Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Booyah, baby, bow down
Making me say wow now
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Sugar, sugar, how now
Take your body downtown
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and
Baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your National Anthem

Money is the reason
We exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact
Kiss, kiss

I sing the National Anthem
While I'm standing over your body
Hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me
Or your pants on
See what you've done to me
King of Chevron

He said to "be cool" but
I'm already coolest
I said to âget real",
âDon't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?â

Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Booyah baby, bow down
Making me say wow now
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Sugar, sugar, how now
Take your body downtown
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and
Baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your National Anthem

It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick sick rampage
Wining and dining
Drinking and driving
Excessive buying
Overdose and dyin'
On our drugs and our love
And our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely
I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well
I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his bell tower, hotel

Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara, and your party dress

I'm your National Anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of
Sweetness and Danger
Queen of Saigon

Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Booyah, baby, bow down
Making me say wow now
Tell me I'm your National Anthem
Sugar, sugar, how now
Take your body down town
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and
Baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your National Anthem

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success

Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem
Of success

And I remember when I met him.
It was so clear that he was the only one for me.
We both knew right away.
And as the years went on things got more difficult,
We were faced with more challenges.
I begged him to stay,
Tried to remember what we had in the beginning.
He was charismatic, magnetic, electric, and everybody knew him
When he walked in every woman's head turned.
Everyone stood up to talk to him.
He was like this hybrid, this mix of a man who couldn't contain himself.
I always got the sense that he became torn between being a good person and missing out on all of the opportunities that life could offer a man as magnificent as him.
And in that way, I understood him.
And I loved him, I loved him, I loved him, I loved him.
And I still love him, I love him.

"Never Let Me Go"

Hold me in your arms
Love me like your best friends did
Promise I won't hurt you, kid
Hold me really tight until the stars look big
Never let me go

All the world is ours
Like they say in Scarface, kid
You can push your drugs and I can make it big
Singing at CBGB's, have a real good gig
Hey, you never know

'Cause, baby, we were born to live fast and die young
Born to be bad, have fun
Honey, you and me can be one
Just believe, come on

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Boy, we're in a world war, let's go all the way
Put your foot to the floor, really walk my way
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay

We gonna go far
I can already taste it, kid
L.A.'s gonna look real good
Drive me in your car until the sky gets big
Never let me go

Send me to the stars
Tell me when I get there, kid
I can be your Nancy, you can be my Sid
Get into some trouble like our parents did
Hey, they'll never know

'Cause baby, we were born to be bad and move on
Built to go fast and stay strong
Honey, you and me, and no one
Just believe, come on

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Boy, we're in a world war, let's go all the way
Put your foot to the floor, really walk my way
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay

I remember when I saw you for the first time
You were laughing, sparkling like a new dime
I came over, "Hello, can you be mine?
Can you be mine? Can you be mine?"

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Baby, it's a sweet life, sing it like a song
It's a short trip, only getting one
Can count on you, my love, more than anyone?
Never let me go

If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Boy, we're in a world war, let's go all the way
Put your foot to the floor, really walk my way
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay

"Noir"

Walking is an art, so is my body
Papi is a workaholic, I'm his little party
I'm Miss Parlor-Tricks, sips of the Bacardi
I can make you dope, sick from the naughtiness
He says, "Who the best?" You is!

I'm glamorous, famous
Notorious, dangerous, "But you're crazy"
"I'm gonna leave you,"
He said, "You're not a real girl
You're like a cartoon
All caught up in this fame game
Yo, good luck, good luck, good luck
May all the stars in the sky
Bow down to you, we're through."

You gotta be smart and I'm a little smarty
Papi is a gangsta, I'm his little dolly
Party favor favorite of them all
He says "Baby doll is so sick"
Sick off your naughtiness-ness-ness-ness-ness

Let's go to Vegas
He say "Who the best?"
He said "She is, she is but, yo
She crazy like in every single way
Like a hurricane
You gotta get out of the way
But she's hot, and she's cold
And she's cool and she's bold
And she's full of rage like me
And I like the game, yo"

Cause I'm glamorous I'm famous
Notorious dangerous but I'm crazy, yo
Glamorous dangerous
Notorious but famous but I'm crazy

He's gonna hate me
He wants a real girl
I'm like a cartoon
All caught up in this fame game
Yo, good luck, good luck
He said "We're through"

"On Our Way"

You, you light my red fire babe
Hot white, and blue
And I, I think that you
I think you're so cool, babe
Loving everything you do

You say we're gonna run away
Put on your sundress, summer day
Flying around on the highway

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and every day
Top down, gonna make a getaway, top down
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
You found me when I had lost my way
Foot down, we're going all the way, touchdown
Gonna make a getaway, top down

You know what I want
Take me to the K-Mart, pick me up pink lip gloss
How you get so hot?
You're making me crazy
Hoping you'll never stop

You say that we were meant to be
We'll be together finally
Flying around and I'm finally free

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and every day
Top down, gonna make a getaway, top down
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
You found me when I had lost my way
Foot down, we're going all the way, touchdown
Gonna make a getaway, top down

We're on our way
We're on our way
We're on our way
We're on our way

Why do I think too much?
You tell me not to worry
Because you're the boss
And you, you got a real good plan
My trouble's all over now
Because you're my man

You don't know what you've done to me
You're heavier than heavenly
Life on the run has set me free, me free now

We're on our way

You tell me not to worry
Because you're the boss

"Once Upon A Dream"
(from "Maleficent" soundtrack)

I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you, that look in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem

But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-aah mmh
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-aah mmh, mmh-mmh, mmh-mmh

But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once
The way you did once upon a dream

I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you, that gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam
And I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem

But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream

"Ooh Baby"

Ooh-ooh baby, can't you hear our favorite song?

Are you ready now?

Ooh-ooh baby, look at all your high-brow friends
Ooh-ooh baby thinking I don't understand
'Cause I'm drinking diet coke a lot, sucking on my lollipops
I know that I'm not that grown up, but no one's better
Ooh-ooh baby, when you gonna be my man?
What ya waiting for? What ya waiting for?

Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Say you wanna put your hands on me?

You're sitting in your office, dreaming of a different life
You say you wanna make me smile and see my wild side
If we don't leave town now
We're never gonna get out of here alive
I'm walking home from school
My thoughts are drifting into space
Why don't we leave tonight
And take off to a different place?
Don't tell my daddy why
Gotta get on that plane and just fly

Take me to Paris
Let's go there and never look back
Paris (ooh), we can be crazy like that
You're such a naughty boy
Why you taking that Polaroid?
Put on a show you'll enjoy
Take me to Paris
(Ooh, la-la, ooh, la-la)
(Ooh, la-la, ooh, la-la)

I wanna be that fantasy that you got on your mind
Flying across the sea to somewhere that they'll never find
We should go while we're young
'Cause one day, we will want to rewind

To our time in Paris
Take me to Yves Saint Laurent
Paris (ooh), make out in a dark restaurant
We'll dance until we die
Why not go out every night?
Promise we won't say goodbye

Take me to Paris
Let's go there and never look back
Paris (ooh), we can be crazy like that
You're such a naughty boy
Why you taking that Polaroid?
Put on a show you'll enjoy
Take me to Paris
(Ooh, la-la, ooh, la-la)
(Ooh, la-la, ooh, la-la)

Walking through the streets at dawn
We dance by empty carousels
Singing at the SacrÃ©-CÅur
And climbing up the Tour Eiffel
Under the stars, we are, we are
Dreaming (of Paris)

You're such a naughty boy
Why you taking that Polaroid?
Put on a show you'll enjoy

Take me to Paris (ooh)
Take me to Yves Saint Laurent
It's Paris (ooh), make out in a dark restaurant
We'll dance until we die
Why not go out every night?
Promise we won't say goodbye
Take me to Paris
(Ooh, la-la, ooh, la-la)
(Ooh, la-la, ooh, la-la)

Baby, say goodnight
Text me when you get home safely
Like you always did when we was first dating

"Party Girl (St. Tropez)"

Standing on the rooftop
Just out of earshot
Looking at this gangster guy

Thinking he's a hot shot
Pouring me a big shot
Trying to get me drunk and high

He wishes to be seen with me in his limousine
And he says, "We'll have a real good time"
Well, XXO, but I want you to know

Every single night, in the lights I'll be sparkling bright
I'm just a party girl, trying to get my drinks for free from you
If you hold me tight, it's alright, let the fire ignite
I'm a party girl, and I'm just warning you

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
Came tonight to put my work on display
Bringing New York down to St. Tropez

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
I won't fall in love, I won't ever stop
I'm partying all night, I'm gonna make it pop

Kissing on your white yacht
Show me what you got got
Play a little rock n' roll
On an island hop stop, maybe we should dot dot dot
(Lose control)

Do you think it's really mean that I'm only on the scene
'Cause I want a little danger boy?
Well, XXO, but I told you so

Every single night, in the lights I'll be sparkling bright
I'm just a party girl, trying to get my drinks for free from you
If you hold me tight, it's alright, let the fire ignite
I'm a party girl, and I'm just warning you

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
Came tonight to put my work on display
Bringing New York down to St. Tropez

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
I won't fall in love, I won't ever stop
I'm partying all night, I'm gonna make it pop

It's not about us, just forget about us
Tonight
Put your cigarette down, baby, light up the town
Beside me

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
Came tonight to put my work on display
Bringing New York down to St. Tropez

You don't get it, you just don't get it
You've already forgotten even though I just said it
I won't fall in love, I won't ever stop
I'm partying all night, I'm gonna make it pop

"Pin-Up Galore"

Pin up girls at the roller derby
Take me down to Newark, New Jersey
American flags
Blue, blue streamers
Everybody's laughing
The crowd is cheering

Baby, I've become someone
Baby, I've become
Baby, I've become someone
Not of this world
Not of this world

Dance at night back in Alabama
Christmas lights on my teal-green trailer
American flags
Blue, blue streamers
All the men are watching
The crowd is screaming

Baby, I've become someone
Baby, I've become
Baby, I've become someone
Not of this world
Not of this world

Prizes, prizes
A diamond tiara
Here's to the girl with the blue mascara
I have a disco ball mind
Lights flashing all of the time
I have a disco ball mind
I wanna die, I wanna die
I wanna die, I wanna die

Ooh, ooh

Baby, I've become someone
Baby, I've become
Baby, I've become someone
Not of this world
Not of this world

"Pink Champagne"

I don't really wanna die
I just want the pain to be over
I know that I talked about it all the time, babe
Just wanted you to come over
I got tired of America
It got hard to just stay sober
Then I met you and you blew my mind
That was it, game over

We could get lost in the purple rain
Talk about the good old days
I could get drunk on some pink champagne
Lost in the purple haze

Let me love me like you a woman
Let me hold you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be your one time beauty queen
You don't know the world like I do
You don't know how good our love can be
Let me love me like you a woman
Let me take you to infinity
Baby, take you to infinity
Baby

I don't really wanna fly
I just want this tour to be over
I know that I dreamed about it all my life
Then the dream got closer
I miss the smell of America
Green palms, green clover
I can still feel it when I close my eyes
It comes right over

We could get lost in the purple mist
Think about the good old times
Let it come down like the ocean wave
Hold your body in my mind

Let me love me like you a woman
Let me love you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be your one time beauty queen

You don't know the world like I do
You don't know how good people can be
Let me love me like you a woman
Let me take you to infinity
Baby, take you to infinity
Baby

I n-n-n-need you
Don't, don't fucking leave yet
I need, n-n-n-need you
Don't fu-, don't fucking leave yet

Let me love me like you a woman
Let me love you like a baby
Let me shine like a diamond
Let me be your one time beauty queen

You don't know the world like I do
You don't know how good people can be
Let me love me like you a woman
Let me love you like a baby
Baby, take you to infinity
Baby, take you to infinity

Baby, get drunk on some pink champagne
Get lost in the purple haze

Sometimes I rap too

"Playing Dangerous"

Everybody knows I'm a good girl officer
No, I wouldn't do a thing like that, that's for sure
The house was already on fire, I swear I'm not a liar
Well I'm a little shaken, but I'm fine, thanks for asking
Tell me, do you always work alone so late?
Gosh, I'm a little shy standing here in my nightgown
Do you really have to put those tight handcuffs on?

Looking at me, then suddenly
I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane

I've been bad, I've been wrong
Playing a dangerous game
I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane, hurricane, hurricane

Let's get in the back of your cop car, officer
You can ask me anything you want
Anything, anything

Do you have a girl?
I don't see a ring on your finger
Well that's interesting have you
Ever thought of dating a singer?

The flames are getting higher
So is my desire
It's kind of exciting
Don't you think?

Then suddenly he is uncuffing me
I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane

I've been bad, I've been wrong
Playing a dangerous game
I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane, hurricane, hurricane

If you can't stand the heat
Then stay out of the fire
You might get what you desire
Boy, love is strange
Sometimes it makes you crazy
It can burn or break you

If you can't stand the heat
Then stay out of the fire
You might get what you desire
Boy, love is strange
Sometimes it makes you crazy
It can burn or break you down

I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane
I'm in love, I'm in love
Love in a hurricane

I've been bad, I've been wrong
Playing a dangerous game
I'm in love, I'm in love
Loving hurricane, hurricane, hurricane

"Prom Song (Gone Wrong)"

Boy, it's late, walk me home, put your hand in mine
At the gate, stop and say, "be my valentine"
You are, by far, the brightest star
I've ever seen, and I never dreamed
I'd be so happy that I could die

You used to say that I was beautiful like Cleopatra
But you the king, too, so I would say, "Back at ya"
I flip my hair and make you stare and put my make-up on
And make up stories 'bout my life and put on very cherry bomb
And even then, I knew that we were something serious
That you would dominate my thoughts like radio to Sirius
I'd see you in the hall like, "Hello, hello"
Up against the wall like, "Let's go, let's go"

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste within this teenage wasteland
You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

If you're lonely, baby, hold me, you're my only one
Watching television, kissing 'til we see the sun
So far, we are safe in the dark
And I never dreamed that I'd be the queen
And I'd be so happy that I could die

You used to call yourself The Don and call me Queen Diana
You always make me blush and say, "Shut up boy, you bananas!"
You pull my hair and push me down and chase me, make me run
You played me Biggie Smalls, and then my first Nirvana song
So even then, when no one's friends were really serious
I knew you loved me by the way you looked in second period
I'd see you in the hall like, "Hello, hello"
Up against the wall like, "Let's go, let's go"

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste within this teenage wasteland
You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

I know that they say that all I want
Is to have fun
And get away for rainy days
I know that they think I've come undone
But I'm in love, I wanna run, run, run away
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste within this teenage wasteland
You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

"Puppy Love"

It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love

You make me wanna be like one of those girls
From the 1950s wearing those big pearls
I'll cook you breakfast, coffee on your desk, yes
I might burn your toast but baby I'm still the bestest

It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love

You make me wanna be like one of those girls
On the color TV, it was a new world
The Dick van Dyke show, we're Cher and Bono
The way I sing "I Got You Babe", makes you say, "Oh, no."
Cause you're the class president without Jackie O
And I'm singing "Happy Birthday" like Marilyn Monroe

(One) This is not a school girl crush (No)
(Two) This is not puppy love (uh-uh)
It's the real thing when you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby

(One) This is not a school girl thing (No)
(Two) What about the diamond ring (uh-uh)?
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it, baby

It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love

You make me wanna be like one of those girls
Calendar pin-up queen, in platinum curls
I'll do my summer pose, golden sand between my toes
You can pack my favorite snack, a Veuve Clicquot and Ho Hos
You're everybody's hero and you're hitting it hard
While I'm singing for the soldiers like Marilyn Monroe

(One) This is not a school girl crush (No) (Two)
This is not puppy love (uh-uh)
It's the real thing when you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby
(One) This is not a school girl thing (No) (Two)
What about the diamond ring (uh-uh)?
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it, baby
And if I call you on the telephone, I might overdose
Cause I'm strong but I'm lonely like Marilyn Monroe
This is not a school girl crush
This is not puppy love

It's the real thing when you told me you loved me
What ever happened to hold me and trust me, baby (One)
This is not a school girl crush (No)

(Two) This is not puppy love (uh-uh)
It's the real thing when you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby
(One) This is not a school girl thing (No) (Two)
What about the diamond ring (uh-uh)?
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it, baby
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love
It's not puppy love, puppy-puppy-puppy love

What you do to me is indescribable
Got me sparkling just like an emerald

I jump through hula hoops of fire just to get to you

You're making me crazy, oh, little baby
Shut your complaining, aye-aye-aye-aye
You make me so angry, someone should pay me
Why don't you get the sty-y-y-yle?
Make me smile

Life's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul
You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance

Oh, honey, when you call me, I want to
Stay on the telephone for hours just to get you home
Oh, sugar, when you call me after school
I see your smile and I could run a methampheta-mile

I'll never forget it, oh, you'll regret it
Nowhere to kiss it, aye-aye-aye-aye
Take it or leave it, better believe it
You'll never see why-y-y-y
Say goodbye

Love's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul
You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance

New kind of porno
One that has yet been born, oh
Loving you's like loving a hurricane, I'm tired of
All the mess you make, all the hearts you break
Loving you's like loving a dirty bomb, you're blowing up
All the cash I'm paid, all the love we made

Love's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul

Love's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul
You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance
Your problem with commitment is
The bane of my existence

True love, it comes once
You messed it up, you stupid

"Ride"
(Music-Video Version)

[Spoken introduction:]
I was in the winter of my life, and the men I met along the road were my only summer
At night I fell asleep with visions of myself, dancing and laughing and crying with them
Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour, and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me, and my only real happy times
I was a singer. Not a very popular one
I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet, but upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky that I wished on over and over again, sparkling and broken
But I didn't really mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted, and then losing it to know what true freedom is
When the people I used to know found out what I had been doing, how I'd been living, they asked me "Why?", but there's no use in talking to people who have home
They have no idea what it's like to seek safety in other people, for home to be wherever you lay your head
I was always an unusual girl
My mother told me I had a chameleon soul, no moral compass pointing due north, no fixed personality; just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean
And if I said I didn't plan for it to turn out this way I'd be lying
Because I was born to be the other woman
Who belonged to no one, who belonged to everyone
Who had nothing, who wanted everything, with a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldn't even talk about it, and pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me

I been out on that open road
But you can be my full-time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
But you can be my full-time baby, hot or cold

Don't break me down (Don't break me down)
I been traveling too long (I been traveling too long)
I been trying too hard (I been trying too hard)
With one pretty song (With one pretty song)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life and art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it, light 'til dark

Don't leave me now (Don't leave me now)
Don't say goodbye (Don't say goodbye)
Don't turn around (Don't turn around)
Leave me high and dry (Leave me high and dry)

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
It's all I've got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just ride

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast
I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride

[Spoken ending:]
Every night I used to pray that I'd find my people, and finally I did on the open road
We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore, except to make our lives into a work of art
Live fast. Die young. Be wild. And have fun
I believe in the country America used to be
I believe in the person I want to become
I believe in the freedom of the open road
And my motto is the same as ever:
"I believe in the kindness of strangers. And when I'm at war with myself I ride, I just ride."
Who are you?
Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies?
Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?
I have. I am fucking crazy
But I am free

"Roses"

(Uh, feeling's gone, feeling's gone)
(Uh, this love is dead)

You always buy me roses when I'm mad
Do you think I'll forgive you just like that?
Did you forget who you were seeing, yeah?
I'm not letting you off easy, I'm still sad

I'm kissing you hard, you got my lipstick on your face
I stole your girlfriend's keys, kicked her out of your place
Cause I want you more than I did before, -fore
I'm missing you hard, give you my soft-core baby face
And then we start to fight, tumble down the staircase
And when we hit that floor, you want me even more, more

And then you buy me roses and it's fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you're mine
I'll let you off easy, it's alright
And then you buy me roses and it's fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you're mine
I'll let you off easy, it's alright

You always buy me roses like a creep
Asking for forgiveness, unsexy
What happened to the man you used to be?
If you still want my love then work for me

You're kissing me hard, you got my lipstick on your face
You show me what you got and put a girl in her place
If you want me more than you did before
(Uh, feeling's gone, feeling's gone)

And then you buy me roses and it's fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you're mine
I'll let you off easy, it's alright
And then you buy me roses and it's fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you're mine
I'll let you off easy, it's alright

We had conversations, ain't nothing said
This girl is crazy, I've done lost my head
"Her life is awesome", the doctor said
But my shit feel awful, this love is dead

And then you buy me roses and it's fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you're mine
I'll let you off easy, it's alright
And then you buy me roses and it's fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you're mine
I'll let you off easy, it's alright

See I could see the pain
In her eyes, in her eyes
This love is dead
This love is dead

"Run Motorcycle"

This is stupid, this whole sober
This is stupid, this whole sober thing
All the boys with me like to drink
This is stupid, this whole music thing
I'm burnt out, and I don't wanna sing

But I've got nothing better, but my sleeve
If life can't be fun, then I guess I'll have to leave
I said, "Run motorcycle run"
Run motorcycle run

Am I lovely? Flowers in my hair
Do you love me? You, yes you over there
Everybody asks me who I am
I'm nobody, I'm only a man

And I got nothing better, but my sleeve
If life can't be fun, then I guess I'll have to leave
So I say "Run motorcycle run"
Run motorcycle run
Run motorcycle run
Run motorcycle run

"Say Yes To Heaven"

If you dance, I'll dance
And if you don't, I'll dance anyway
Give peace a chance
Let the fear you have fall away

I've got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you

Say yes to Heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to Heaven
Say yes to me

If you go, I'll stay
You come back, I'll be right here
Like a barge at sea
In the storm, I stay clear

'Cause I've got my mind on you
I've got my mind on you

Say yes to Heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to Heaven
Say yes to me

If you dance, I'll dance
I'll put my red dress on, get it on
And if you fight, I'll fight
It doesn't matter now, it's all gone

I've got my mind on you
I got my mind on you

Say yes to Heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to Heaven
Say yes to me

I've got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you, mm
I've got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you

Ah, don't fuck with me

'Cause you're not a gangster (Don't fuck with me)
(Scarface)
No no, you don't don't (Don't fuck with me)
'Cause you're not a gangster

Life is death when blow is life
But me and my crew
We know what we like
We know how to roll
Will we ever stop? No!

Fuck!

"Season Of The Witch"
(from "Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark" soundtrack)

When I look out my window
Many sights to see
And when I look in my window
So many different people to be

They're strange, so strange
It's very strange to me

You've got to pick up every stitch (Gonna be)
You've got to pick up every stitch (Gonna be, gonna be)
You've got to pick up every stitch
Oh no, must be the season of the witch
Must be the season of the witch

When I look over my shoulder (What happens then?)
What do you think I see? (Mm)
Some other cat looking over (Shadoop, shadoop)
Over the shoulder at me (Ah, at me)

And he's strange, so strange (So strange)
He's very strange to me

You've got to pick up every stitch (Gonna be)
You've got to pick up every stitch (Gonna be, gonna be)
Beatniks are out to make it rich
Oh no, must be the season of the witch

"Serene Queen"

Why you so uptight, what's the problem?
Everybody knows you're doing it anyway
Why you act so tired when you got so much?
You could be sending it my way
Those guys were cool, but you'll never give yourself away
And I'm not a fool, no, "I love you" I said

He had all his guns and all his guns were blazing
Put his arms around me, so amazing
He had all his guns all his guns were blazing
Put his arms around me, so amazing
Amazing, amazing, amazing

He'd call me the serene queen
(Come on baby, if you want it you can get it right)
The serene queen

I don't start fights but I'll stop 'em all by my any means
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

Why you so upset, what's the problem?
Everybody knows you're doing it anyway
Why you act so tough when you got so much?
Going for you already
Those guys were cool, but you never gave yourself away

He had all his guns and all his guns were blazing
Put his arms around me so amazing
He had all his guns, all his guns were blazing
Put his arms around me so amazing
Amazing, amazing, amazing

"Serial Killer"

Wish I may, wish I might
Find my one true love tonight
Do you think that he could be you?
If I pray really tight
Get into a fake bar fight
While I'm walking down the avenue
If I lay really quiet
I know that what I do isn't right
I can't stop what I love to do
So I murder love in the night
Watching them fall one by one, they fight
Did you think you'll love me too?

Baby, I'm a sociopath
Sweet serial killer
On the warpath
'Cause I love you just a little too much
I love you just a little too much (much, much)
You can see me drinking Cherry Cola
Sweet serial killer
I left a love note
Said, you know I love the thrill of the rush
You know I love the thrill of the rush

(You send me right to heaven)
Sweet serial killer
(I guess I'll see him over)
Do it for the thrill of the rush
Love you just a little too much, much
(You send me right to heaven)
Sweet serial killer
(I guess I'll see him over)
I love you just a little too much
Love you just a little too much, much

My black fire's burning bright
Maybe I'll go out tonight
We can paint the town in blue
I'm so hot, I ignite
Dancing in the dark and I shine
Like a light, I'm luring you
Sneak up on you really quiet
Whisper, "Am I what your heart desires?"
I can be your ingenue
Keep you safe and inspired
Baby, let your fantasies unwind
We can do what you want to do

Baby, I'm a sociopath
Sweet serial killer
On the warpath
'Cause I love you just a little too much
I love you just a little too much (much, much)
You can see me drinking Cherry Cola
Sweet serial killer
I left a love note
Said, you know I love the thrill of the rush
You know I love the thrill of the rush (rush, rush)

(You send me right to heaven)
Sweet serial killer
(I guess I'll see him over)
Do it for the thrill of it all
Love you just a little too much, much
(You send me right to heaven)
Sweet serial killer
(I guess I'll see him over)
I love you just a little too much
Love you just a little too much, much

Just have fun
(Wanna play you like a Gameboy)
I don't want one
(What's the thrill of the same toy?)
La-la, la-la, la, la-la, la-la, lie down, down
Just have fun
(Wanna play you like a Gameboy)
I don't want one
(What's the thrill of the same toy?)
La-la, la-la, la, la-la, la-la, lie down, down
Oh!

You can see me drinking Cherry Cola
Sweet serial killer
I left a love note
Said, you know I love the thrill of the rush

"She's Not Me"

Down, down, down
Mm, uh-huh
Huh, let's go!

When you got her in the back seat
Driving round the back streets
Trying to block me out
(Do you remember my name?)
Cruising down Santa Monica Boulevard
Does it light up the spark?
(Do you remember my name?)

Is she your ride-or-die bitch
Does she know I'm tattooed onto your heart?
You can try to fight it
I have left my mark on you
There is nothing you can do

When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real-life suicide blonde
(You like that?)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me

When you take her to Chateau Marmont
'Cause you booked the top suite
Lay her on the bed
(Do you remember my name?)
Strip her down to her bare ass
In her Kiki de Montparnasse
Like I used to have
(Do you remember my name?)

Is she your ride-or-die bitch
Does she make you shiver under your skin
Just the way that I did?
It won't be the same again
She don't compare to who I am

When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real-life suicide blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me

You try to forget and you tell her that you miss her
But I bet every time you go to kiss her
You get a hot rush feeling on your lips
It's me taking over you, throwing you a curve ball
Reminding you of our true romance and
Just like the first time you learned to dance and
I showed you all those moves she can't do
She's not me (me, me)

When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real-life suicide blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me
When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real-life suicide blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me

"So Legit"

You were the freak king of the piercing shop
All the girls thought they could sing
But they're really not, shit, I don't get it
You're looking like a man, you're talking like a baby
How the fuck is your song in a Coke commercial? Crazy
I don't get it, your taste once exquisite

What happened to Brooklyn?
What happened to New York?
What happened to my scene?
What happened to punk rock, rock?

You called me the queen of the downtown scene, babe
How the fuck would you go switch it up and then replace me?
I don't get it, I'm so legit

Tell me, was it 'cause I wasn't platinum in jewels?
That perhaps, you thought I was a little bit of an uncool
Kid, was that it?

Stefani, you suck, I know you're selling twenty million
Wish they could have seen you when we booed you off in Williamsburg
You're hurt, I know my words don't hurt ya

Oh, girl, I see you walking 'round in your pearls
Thinking that you're number one
You're so funny, 'cause honey, you're not

What happened to Brooklyn, the last frontier?
They said you could make it anywhere if you can make it here
But where?
No magic in the air

What happened to Brooklyn?
What happened to our scene, baby?
Have we all gone Gaga crazy?
Remember when the streets used to be dangerous
And we were born bad?
And we were born bad?

Punk rock, punk rock
The boys used to punch each other in the face
And girls were walking 'round wasted
Everyone had a good night, come back in sunlight
Punk rock, rock, rock

"Starry Eyed"

Oh, boy, you're starry-eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You've got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

Life doesn't always work out like you planned it
They say, "Make lemonade out of lemons,"
But I try and I just can't understand it
All this trying for no good reason
Man makes plans and God laughs
Why do I even bother to ask, Honey?
Well, once you and I, we were the king and queen of this town
It doesn't matter now
The sun's setting on our love, bye, baby

Oh, boy, you're starry-eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You've got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

Life doesn't always work out like you planned it
They say, "Make lemonade out of lemons,"
But I try and I can't understand it
All this begging for no good reason
Man makes plans and God laughs
Why do I even bother to ask, Honey?
Well, once you and I, we were the king and queen of this town
It doesn't matter now
The sun's setting on our love, bye bye, baby

Oh, boy, you're starry-eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You've got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

It doesn't matter what they say
Let's go do it anyway
Cause you and I have an undying kind of love
You can be mine, I'll be yours, c'mon baby

Oh, boy, you're starry-eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You've got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

Oh, boy, you're starry-eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You've got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that

"Stoplight De-Lite"

I had a man, he was sweet as pie
I met him as I waked right by him
He said, "Baby you so fine that when you walk
Even the stoplights stop talk about you
I saw you and I had to make you mine
'Cause you ultimately the most fine
You know a man like me
Gotta have a woman that's killer
She's got a be killer, killer, killer, baby"

Fly body, dope in the face
Fly body, dope in the face

The way you talk, well, you make me smile
And I'm looking down 'cause I'm kinda shy
You know you're so fine that when you talk
Even the roses get up to walk to you
You're crazy but I knew that at the time
I just cannot resist your golden grill
And your stupid pickup line

Fly body, dope in the face
Fly body, dope in the face

There's something about you when you say
"Come on, come on with me babe."
And I don't know why but I know
Wherever you go, I'm gonna follow

Fly body, don't mean a thing
Fly body, don't mean a thing
Fly body, dope in the face

You're gonna be the, you're gonna be the
You're gonna be the death of me
(Yes you are, you are)

You so fly, you so dope, babe
You so fly, you so dope, babe
Fly like a bird

"Strange Love"

Hey, stranger, my strange love
Would you be mine?
Am I what you're dreaming of?
Hey, stranger, my strange love
What makes you shine?
What makes you fall in love?

It's strange the way we met
A desert road and then
My car had stopped and you pulled off
On your black motorcycle
You rode me to the bar
We danced all night under
The Christmas lights and the dark black night
With the lightning and the thunder

Hey, stranger, my strange love
Would you be mine?
Am I what you're dreaming of?
Hey, stranger, my strange love
What makes you shine?
What makes you fall in love?

You took me to the edge
Of town, that's where you slept
You liked it best when no one else
Could find you or could bother
You poured us mint juleps
And kissed me the lips
You held me tight in the TV light
And you said you never loved her

You have a dark heart, like mine
Things that you've seen in dark time
Let me love you, let me touch you
Let me show you you'll be fine

Hey, stranger, my strange love
Would you be mine?
Am I what you're dreaming of?
Hey, stranger, my strange love
What makes you shine?
What makes you fall in love?

(feat. A$AP Rocky & Playboi Carti)

It's never too late to be who you wanna be
To say what you wanna say
It's never too late to leave if you wanna leave
Or to stay if you wanna stay
But, baby, I got a feeling in my bones
Can't get you out of my veins
You can't escape my affection
Wrap you up in my daisy chains

Hip-hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm

Uh, her sophistication make you wanna quit the bitch you dating
Let's skip the games, let's quit the playing
Boo, let's get acquainted (what?)
Notifications sync in place even when we're on vacation (yeah)
I knew she'd notice like I missed the payment, dang it (Ooh)
But bang it like my fingers (What?)
She pray to God I made it (What?)
But banking like my Franklins (Yeah)
My neighbors stopped the hating (Yeah)
What? (what? They been at it, check it out)
Huh? (We been out here, yeah)
Slide inside it (What?)
Diddy Bopping (What?)
Milly Rocking (What? What?)
She just might become my lover for real
I might fuck with her all summer for real
They better not holler if I cuff her for real
Niggas better run for cover for real
Going bell how I feel, close the deal, pop a seal
Take the whip, two pills on the lips on the real
Truthfully, between you and me, I'm usually single
When it's hot outside this, I ride through any hood with the top out
Hop out

Hip-hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm

White lies and black beaches, miles in between us
Is this love or lust or some game on repeat?
It's like making me crazy
Tell me, "Have patience"
Baby, I need this, white lines and black beaches
White lies and black beaches and blood red sangrias
We traveled for weeks, just to escape your demons
But you've got your reasons in making me crazy
But you've got your reason, white lies and black beaches

High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe

"Summer Of Sam"

Like the summer of Sam, back in '69
I'd be heavenly, deadly on the grind
'Cause to sing this nice has to be a crime
I be murdering and murdering 'em

Like the summer of love back in '69
You can say that I'm yours, but my body is divine
I belong to everybody that I walk by
Like hi, hi
I'm the master of my destiny
You haven't seen the best of me
And if you want the rest of me
You'll have to pay a lovely fee
Hard to stay far, far away from me
'Cause I am the baddest girl in NYC
You can look but please don't touch, boy
Stay away from me

Baby, I'm a cinnamon girl
Keeping it fresh on the far east side
Baby, I'm a tenement girl
Keeping it in touch, your cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Baby, I'm a dangerous girl
You should stay away from me

I've been murdering and murdering 'em
I be murdering and murdering 'em

Like the summer of Sam, back in '69
I'll be tying them up, and hang 'em out to dry
'Cause I'm hot like that when I walk, they die
I be murdering and murdering 'em

Like the summer of love back in '69
When I get on the microphone my, my
They be looking at each other like ay, ay, ay
Like bye, bye

Please excuse m-my vivacity, capacity for hating
'Cause it's incredible
It's better if you stay away from me
I know it's hard, hard to stay far, far away from me
I am the baddest girl in NYC
You can look but please don't touch
But boy, step away from me

Baby, I'm a cinnamon girl
Keeping it fresh, on the e-east side
Baby, I'm a tenement girl
Keeping it in touch, your cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Baby, I'm a dangerous girl
Baby, you should stay away from me

I've been murdering and murdering 'em
Happily
Murdering and murdering 'em ah, ah
Murdering and murdering 'em

I'm diggable, predictable
No, everyone knows all my people
I'll give you a fistful
You know you'll be in a fight
Unmissable, invincible, behavior is despicable
If you're looking for fun you can come out with me tonight

I am the baddest girl in NYC
I am the baddest, ya liking what you see? Yup!

Baby, I'm a cinnamon girl
Keeping it sweet, on the far east side
Baby, I'm a tenement girl
Keeping it in touch, your cherry pie
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in NYC
Honey, I'm a dangerous girl
You should stay away from me

"Summertime Sadness (Cedric Gervais Remix)"
(with Cedric Gervais)

I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feeling alive

Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzling like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness

I'm feeling electric tonight
Cruising down the coast, going about 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzling like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore

Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best

I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness

"Super Movie"

Drop me off at the Copacabana
You're my one true love, aren't you man, ah?
I'm your little Super 8 movie
You know I'm in love with ya truly, yeah
So when, baby, if you
Don't get down (ah ah ah)
Don't get down

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
It's finally time to make a safe get away
I could not be happier

Drop me off, Santo Casino
I got an idea, why don't we go to Mexico?
Like we said we would, and you, don't want, want to
But I think, I think it'd be good for you, Billy
You never want to do nothing anymore and I
Remember the days when you used to sway and you'd

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
It's finally time to make a safe get away
I love you, baby

What happened to us? Me and you?
I was funny once and you were funny, too
One day, we woke up and I found that we had grew
And only I wasn't me, I had come out blue
And you, I don't know what to make of you
You're not a color, you're more of a shape
Of your former self, like they say, babe
I remember the days when you'd

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
And I'll continue always to keep that way

Yellow, red or blue
Don't matter to me if it don't matter to you
We'll just keep on trucking and see what we do and
I remember every way that you love me, baby

Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
Top down, howling "Vegas" all the way
We almost had it all, didn't we, baby?

"Teenage Wasteland"

Boy, it's late, walk me home
Put your hand in mine
At the gates stop and say
"Be my Valentine."

You are by far
The brightest star
I've ever seen
And I never dreamed
I'd be so happy
That I could die

Used to say that I was beautiful
Like Cleopatra
But you the king too so I would say
"Back at'cha!"

I flip my hair and make you stare
And put my make-up on
And make up stories 'bout my life
And put on Very Cherry Bomb

And even then I knew that we were
Something serious
That you would dominate my thoughts of
Radio Two serials

I'd see you in the hall like
"Hello, hello"
Up against the wall like
"Let's go, let's go!"

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste
Within this teenage wasteland

You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place
Now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

If you're lonely, baby, hold me
You're my only one
Watching television, kissing
'Til we see the sun

So far, we are
Safe in the dark
And I never dreamed
That I'd be the queen
And I'd be so happy
That I could die

You used to call yourself "the Don"
And called me "Queen Diana"
You always make me blush I say
"Shut up, boy, you bananas."

You pull my hair and push me down
And chase me, make me run
You play me Biggie Smalls and then
My first Nirvana song

So even then when no one's friends
Were really serious
I knew you loved me by the way
You looked in second period

I'd see you in the hall like
"Hello, hello"
Up against the wall like
"Let's go, let's go!"

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste
Within this teenage wasteland

You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place
Now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

I know that they say
That all I want
Is to have fun
And get away for rainy days

I know that they think
I've come undone
But I'm in love
I wanna run, run, run away

I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste
Within this teenage wasteland

You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place
Now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

"Television Heaven"

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Mm-mm, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Come on, come on

I hope you remember me like this
Smoking cigarettes in my sundress
Glamorous and gangster, oh yes
(My battle lines look like paradise next to you)
I hope I remember you just like that
Looking fresh to death in your ball cap
You say you'll tap it like a hi-hat
(Your stupid lines, they're like dynamite)

The future's looking bright as black tonight
You tell me that our love cannot endure
Baby, if it's wrong, I don't wanna be right
Oh, I don't know a thing of this, I'm sure

There's nowhere on this Earth I would rather be
Than in your bedroom breathing heavily
The way you're smiling, it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly, t-television heaven with you
Swinging in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothing but that t-t-television on
We're kissing in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that MT-TV on, t-television heaven with you
(And now, here's Johnny!)

I wonder if you'll think of me like this
On your fire escape like a hot mess
You say, "You're beautiful but hopeless"
("Come on inside, oh, you crazy child, look at you")
I promise that I'll think of you as the king
Quoting Corleone like you're so mean
It's Cosa Nostra 'cause it's our thing
(I made you mine like a thousand times)

Lucy's in the sky with ice tonight
Heaven knows I've tried hard to find a cure
Baby, if it's wrong, I don't wanna be right
And if you ask again, I'll say I'm sure

There's nowhere on this Earth I would rather be
Than in your bedroom breathing heavily
The way you're smiling, it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly, t-television heaven with you
Swinging in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothing but that t-t-television on
We're kissing in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that MT-TV on, t-television heaven with you

Stay up tonight, turn out the light
It feels so right, baby, you're a vision in blues
Stay up tonight, turn out the light
It feels so right, watching television with you

There's nowhere on this Earth I would rather be
Than in your bedroom breathing heavily
The way you're smiling, it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly, t-television heaven with you
Swinging in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothing but that t-t-television on
We're kissing in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that MT-TV on, t-television heaven with you

"The Man I Love"

All that's real to me is Marilyn and Jesus
Jumping off of bridges
Sparklers and streamers, honey
I wanna fly, I wanna fly, I wanna fly

Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?

All that's real to me is Halloween and Jesus
Coney Island beaches
Chandeliers and seizures, honey
I wanna fly, I wanna fly, I wanna fly
I can't be with the man I love
I can't be, if he treats me rough
I can't see him, I can't call him up
All that's real to me is trailer parks and beaches
Alabama breezes
Platinum and peaches, honey
I wanna fly, I wanna fly, I wanna fly
I can't be with the man I love
I can't be, if he treats me rough
I can't see him, I can't call him up

Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?
Boy, you wanna come to my motel, honey?
Boy, you wanna hold me down, tell me that you love me?
Don't you know that I have really never loved nobody but you?

"There's Nothing To Be Sorry About"

Little boy
Living without you won't be easy to do
Little boy
You are the love of my life
And if you don't wanna talk to me
Well, then I think that's alright

Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
My love

Knowing you are hurt inside
I think of all your happy times
Oh, my
When I ask what I can do
You say remember me the way I was six months ago, oh
I could do so much more for you, y'know
I could make you well if you just asked me to
Oh

Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
I'll do anything
For you or for him
Or whoever else needs some help out there
I swear, I swear

Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
Always

Think of you on quiet nights
At traffic lights and
Every highway and
I get a little scared sometimes when
Everyone I meet I find has
A friend

Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
My love

"Tired Of Singing The Blues"

You know, sometimes I think God is playing a little game with me
Looking down from heaven, laughing, and trying to see how much I can take
Because the way things go, it's like a joke
Nobody's had more shots at the moon, and missed, than me

It's like I got my life stuck, stuck on rewind
Trying to make something of myself, life's got something else in mind
I'm fighting a losing game and I'm biding my time
You won't be my man, do I understand? No, stop
I don't want to hear another word about your 'Why not's'
I bought your bullshit all before, now you trying to sell me more, babe?

Man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired

I'm walking down the streets, you wouldn't know what I was thinking
It's just another white girl day, hey ribbons in my hair, and I am sinking down
A double life, a sordid past, and I am drinking now
I want to be bad, you say you were glad to see me, shut up
I don't want to know another thing you think you know about me
I'm not who you think I am, smiling, but I ain't happy

Man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired

Oh, I'm so far gone, I can't turn off my mind
It's like a ticking time bomb
Trying to kill me from inside
Haunting day and night
Is there no remedy for memory?

I've felt this way before I've known the depths of utter desperation
My boyfriend says I'm like an old movie star with loneliness as my occupation
I know that he's right but I don't care tonight
I want to be bad, I want to be bad, I can't stop
I keep running around the same town, knocking you down, I'm fucked
How can I get out when there's nowhere to go for miles around?

A man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired

Everybody knows they call me Brooklyn baby
Everyone's one true love on the side
(Love on the side, love on the side)
Everybody knows I'm American, baby
Watching me dance while you get h-high
(Get h-high, get h-high)
Everybody knows they call me trouble, baby
One of us comes from the white trash side
(White trash side, white trash side)
I'm everything you want but it's hard to decide
Cause everybody wants true love on the side
(Love on the side, love on the side)

(Tell me when)

You try to get away but it can't be denied
Cause everybody wants true love on the side
I'm everything you want but it's hard to decide
Cause everybody wants true love on the side
Yeah-yea-yea-yeah

Everybody knows they call me Brooklyn baby
Everyone's one true love on the side
(Love on the side, love on the side)
Everybody knows I'm American, baby
Watching me dance while you get h-high
(Get h-high, get h-high)
Everybody knows they call me trouble, baby
One of us comes from the white trash side
(White trash side, white trash side)
Everybody knows they call me Brooklyn baby
Everyone's one true love on the side
(Love on the side, love on the side)

I only put you down cause I want you so much
I only put you down cause I want you so much
I only put you in a box, cause you're giving me a head rush
I only put you in a box, cause you're giving me a head rush
I only put you down cause I want you so much
I only put you down cause I want you so much
I only want your love, I want your love, want your love
I'm a lion in a party dress
I won't stop until I get the best

"TV In Black And White"

If you get lonely, think of me only
Prison isn't going to keep me from you
Remember Coney Island and how we
Went into the water, 'til the waves turned blue?
Nobody does have to know that our love's alive
Keep it on the low if you want to hide
Got that same address if you want to write
One Greenwich Avenue, wishing and thinking of you

Living without you's like TV in black and white
You turned me on and brought color into my life
When I'm around you, suddenly, I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

If you get lonely, think of this only
Heaven hasn't forgotten about you
Though you can't hold me, pick up and phone me
Use your one phone call on your ex girl, boo
I won't tell a single soul how you spend your nights
In that single cell, holding your pillow tight
If you really are afraid, then you ought to know
That you're the one I want, the one I want forever more

Living without you's like TV in black and white
You turned me on and brought color into my life
When I'm around you, suddenly, I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

I know you get scared sometimes, boy
Nothing to be feared when you're in my heart
Troubles come in threes but in your case
They came in millions and trillions, but that's all right

Living without you's like TV in black and white
You turned me on and brought color into my life
When I'm around you, suddenly, I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes

Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white

"Unidentified Flying Bill"

Bill takes me down to the beach
In the coat that he got from his father
He whispers to me that sometimes
He thinks he sees things over the water
Like maybe UFOs or something
Flying in the air
Well, I don't know about those, Bill
But I don't care

Slow burn, I'm hot like a fire
I'm sober, but you're getting higher
Life is so crazy, I can't take it
But at least we've got the night
We still got tonight

Bill takes me down to the beach
In East Hampton and walks on the water
Says they don't know it yet
But I'm the second coming of the Father
And he keeps on fishing
Tryna turn one into twenty
He's turnin' the ocean into wine for the summertime

Slow burn, I'm hot like a fire
I'm sober, but you're getting higher
Life is so crazy, I can't take it
But at least we've got tonight
We still got tonight
We still got tonight
We still got tonight

Tell it to me
Tell me I'm wrong
Come to me
Come to me
Tell me I'm wrong
Come to me
Send me, now
Tell me I'm wrong
(Tell me I'm wrong)
Ohh

Slow burn, I'm hot like a fire
I'm sober, but you're still getting higher
Life is so crazy, I can't take it
But at least we've got the night
We still got the night

"Velvet Crowbar"

I was addicted to you but I didn't know it
You were afflicted by booze
You didn't show it huh

Life is a velvet crowbar
Hitting you over the head
You're bleeding but you want more
"This is so like you," I said
Put yourself on back to bed

You're like crack to me I don't want to leave
I'm watching you sleep, afraid you'll stop breathing
My baby's on his eighth life darling
Staying with him 'til the morning

You're like crack to me so fun I can't see
With your golden grill, your purple dream
My baby's on his eighth life darling
Gonna watch him 'til the morning

I was addicted to you didn't wanna blow it
You were a dick with your crew
Always on the road

You wanna touch life so hard
Why can't you give it a rest?
You're not that bright for a star
Burned yourself out nothing left
Burned yourself out nothing left

You're like crack to me I don't want to leave
I'm watching you sleep, afraid you'll stop breathing
My baby's on his eighth life darling
Staying with him 'til the morning

You're like crack to me so fun I can't see
With your golden grill, your purple dream
My baby's on his eighth life darling
Gonna watch him 'til the morning

Styrofoam on the microphone
Can't give it up, can't go it alone
Flame-colored paradise for you darling
But death doesn't come with a warning

Life is a velvet crowbar
Hitting you over the head
You're bleeding syrup amour
Bleeding to death

You're like crack to me I don't want to leave
I'm watching you sleep, afraid you'll stop breathing
My baby's on his last life darling
I'm staying with him 'til the morning

You're like crack to me so fun I can't see
With your golden grill, your purple dream
My baby's on his eighth life darling
Gonna watch him 'til the morning
Gonna stay with him 'til morning

My baby's on his eighth life, darling
(Gonna stay around 'til morning)

My baby's on his eighth life, darling
And death doesn't come with a warning

"Wait"

Wait a little longer kid
What you want to grow up so fast for?
Why you doing like I did?
Didn't you say I got what I asked for?

But you're afraid to find out
Like me and climb out
But you're always close to me
You got a different story
It's the same damn thing
Got a long way, rest your feet
I know you can do anything

You were such a handsome boy
Don't you give up your glory
Why you want to hit them streets?
Didn't you never hear my story?

And it's fine to waste time
But you got a beautiful mind
And you're always close to me
You're a different kid
But it's the same damn thing
And it's a long way, you better rest your feet
I know that you want everything

That's what you told me
I still believe you
I still see it's true
I need you and I know you, dear
But if you've gotta make it then
I can take it from here

Wait a little longer kid
Didn't I never say I would miss you?
Don't go until I come home
Please don't go until I kiss you

And it's hard to grow up
But we all know it's tough
Yeah, you're always close to me
You have a different story
It's the same damn thing
You got a long way, c'mon and rest your feet
I know you can do anything

"Watercolor Eyes"
(from "Euphoria" soundtrack)

Why you always doing that?
Breaking up with me then making up
Just to make me mad

I think that you taste like rock candy
Sweet like beaches, leave me all sandy
Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes?
Young love don't always last forever
Wild horses can't keep us together
So what if you taste just like heaven
That don't make it right
Hot summer and cold watermelon
Your love stings like blood and a lemon
Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes?

Watercolor eyes, watercolor eyes, watercolor eyes
That don't make it right

Why you always doing that?
Playing guitar while I'm sleeping
Acting like a brat

I think that you're sweet like rock candy
Warm like beaches that leave me sandy
Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes?
Young love don't always last forever
Wild horses can't keep us together
So what if you taste just like heaven
That don't make it right
Hot summer and cold watermelon
Your love stings like blood and a lemon
Why do you leave me with watercolor eyes?

Watercolor eyes, watercolor eyes, watercolor eyes
That don't make it right
Watercolor eyes, watercolor eyes, watercolor eyes
That don't make it right

Why you always doing that?
Breaking up with me then making up just to make me mad
Oh, hey-hey, why?
That don't make it right

"Wayamaya"

He was a big wave surfer
Living down by Waimea Bay
We had a few friends
Never thought it would end

I remember an all white day with 8-story waves
He said, "Your eyes are gray." (Beautiful)
We were living on CÃ´te d'Alene
On Carol Lane, sun Manta Ray

Driving in our Mercury down to Waimea
Driving in our Mercury
Driving in our Mercury down to Waimea
Driving in our Mercury

I remember we came in May
And we changed our names to Lana and Ray
We be up 'til the sun rose, ay
I'm in gold LamÃ©, your pink floral, hey

Driving in our Mercury down to Waimea
Driving in our Mercury
Driving in our Mercury down to Waimea
Driving in our Mercury

Waikiki-ko, Waikiki-ko
Waikiki, Waikiki, Waikiki-ko
Waikiki-ko, Waikiki-ko
Waikiki, Waikiki, Waikiki-ko

"Westbound"

You didn't think about anyone else
You didn't think about any of us
When you left that place
You didn't want to go anywhere else
Nothing could satisfy you 'til you left
So you went away

Where did you go?
Where are you now?
I ask about
So many of my friends
Oh, about their ends
What about us?
Are we just dust
On the floor again
I thought we were on the mend

You really put me in a quite a position
You got me struggling as a musician
With a song
You like to write about all of your problems
Put them in songs because you think it will solve them
But you're wrong

Why did you go?
I guess I know
Maybe my question is
Why must it come to this?
You talk about
Being strong, yeah
How I want to be
You and your melody

Trying to learn about something important
You keep taking up space, you're annoying
But I love you so
Yeah, you already know
They're trying to teach me about new ways of living
They're trying to teach me about ways of forgiving
But you make it hard
You're such a bad, bad boy

I love you anyway
No matter what they say
You were not approved
But you are on the moon
I care about
How this turns out
It's just more than I
Ever knew how to fight
I guess I won't
Tell me I have to
Tell me I have to
I know you could
I said I know you could
Where are you now?
I ask about

"What's A Girl To Do"

Don't tell me that I'm fine
You break me all the time when you don't mean to
Yo, heartbreak's not a crime
But maybe it should be when it comes to you
I don't really know why you do them things
But maybe now, baby, if I start to sing
I can knock a little sense into you

What's a stupid girl to do
When she loves somebody as fucked up like you
Where am I supposed to go
When the only boy I ever knew said no
Absolutely nothing

Don't tell me it's alright
You never really knew what you meant to me
I'm, I'm crying every night
Because everything's so strange when you're not with me

And I don't really know why you had to go
But I have to trust that only God can know
If I pray, maybe I'll find out what's true

What's a stupid girl to do
When she loves somebody as fucked up like you
Where am I supposed to go
When the only boy I ever knew said no
Absolutely nothing

Ahh, ahh, uh uh oh
Ahh, ahh, uh uh oh

You break me down
I get back up
You're telling me
I say "What's up"
Nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing
Can't go back to you

What's a stupid girl to do
When she loves somebody as fucked up as you
And where am I supposed to go
When the only boy I ever loved said no
Absolutely nothing

Absolutely nothing, no
Absolutely nothing
Absolutely nothing, no
Absolutely nothing
Absolutely nothing, no
Absolutely nothing

"Wild One"

Can't be bitter when I talk about him, Mike
I should have known better but I left without him and I
I used to dance for him, dance for him
I used to dance every Saturday night
I used to shake it for him, shake it for him
I want to stay but there's something ain't right

I'm wild, I'm free
No man can handle me
I write, I sing
Freedom's my love, God is my king
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one

I ain't no sinner, but sometimes I wonder why?
It's the middle of winter but in my mind it's summer, Mike
Used to move for you, move for you
Was a pleasure and the pleasure was mine

I'm wild, I'm free
No man can handle me
I write and I sing
Freedom's my love, God is my king
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one

God bless America
God bless the world at large
Guide these two wheels of ours
Right to the stripes and stars

I'm wild, I'm free
No man can handle me
I write and I sing
Freedom's my love, God is my king

I'm wild, I'm free
No man can handle me
I write and I sing
Freedom's my love, God is my king

I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one
I'm a wild one

"Yes To Heaven"

If you dance I'll dance
And if you don't I'll dance anyway
Give peace a chance
Let the fear you have fall away

I've got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you

Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me

If you go I'll stay
You come back I'll be right here
Like a barge at sea
In the storm I stay clear

'Cause I've got my mind on you
I've got my mind on you

Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me

If you dance I'll dance
I'll put my red dress on again
And if you fight I'll fight
It doesn't matter, now it's all gone

I've got my mind on you
I've got my mind on you

Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me

I've got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you
I've got my mind on you

"You & Me"

Got a light in your eyes, I can see it
Look into my mind to believe it
Try hard to remember the beach
Blue water from the sea, hands all over me
Tattoos, they were glistening
It's been so long since someone made me different

Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Be free and alive
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Just feel alive
It's just you and the sun, it's just you and the sun now baby

Gonna light up the skies, I can see it
You're God's favorite child, boy, believe it
Try hard to remember the days
Sick as fucking cyanide
Diamonds and getting blazed
Your tattoos, still magnificent
No longer high, but you're not very different

Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Be free and alive
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Just feel alive
It's just you and the sun, it's just you and the sun now baby

I get so damn tired
You set my soul on fire
Ignite me, inspired
Make me higher and higher

Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Be free and alive
Give heaven a try, be young and be wild
Just feel alive
It's just you and the sun, it's just you and the sun now baby

"You Can Be The Boss"

You taste like the Fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my
I love you but I don't know why

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Don't let it stop
You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don't let it stop

He had a cigarette with his number on it
He gave it over to me, "Do you want it?"
I knew it was wrong but I palmed it
I saved it, I waited, I called it
The liquor on your lips, the liquor on your lips
The liquor on your lips makes you dangerous
I knew it was wrong, I'm beyond it
I tried to be strong but I lost it

You taste like the Fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Don't let it stop
You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don't let it stop

He has a white corvette like I want it
A fire in his eyes, know, I saw it
He's bleeding from his brain and his wallet
He's sick and he's taken but honest
The liquor on your lips, the liquor on your lips
The liquor on his lips I just can't resist
As close as I'll get to the darkness
He tells me to, "Shut up, I got this"

You taste like the Fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Don't let it stop
You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don't let it stop

I need you, I need you babe
Like I never needed anyone
You're wrong but you're so much fun
You say you treat 'em mean
To keep 'em keen
But you, you're not that nice
But you taste like the Fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my

You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Don't let it stop
You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don't let it stop

All the gin joints
In all the towns in all the world
She walks into mine

"You're Gonna Love Me"

Cherry says that anytime
I think I have a good idea
That I should do the opposite
Of whatever it is I feel
And that's because I have a bad mind
And I have gold in my veins
But he says I got the purest heart
That he's ever seen

What'd God give me a brain for?
He won't help me use it
What'd God give me a plan for
If he won't help me do it?

You're gonna love me
I'm gonna make you
You're gonna love me
I'm gonna make you

Well I can tell that you're the type
To never trust a beauty queen
But I was never voted for nothing
And high school never meant
Anything to anybody
Never ever gave myself away
But even when I'm funny
You think I'm acting, so I say

What'd God give me a brain for
If he won't let me use it?
What'd God give me a plan for?
He never helps me do it

You're gonna love me
I'm gonna make you
You're gonna love me
I'm gonna make you

You say that you don't want to be hypnotized
But baby I, I don't want to hypnotize you
There's nothing from you that I want to take
I just want to be like you
(Maybe love you just a little bit)
Please

Jim, I'mma dedicate this whole album to you
You told me to get my way
That's exactly what I'm gonna do
I'm going to strike out, right now
I'm striking out right now with this song
But I can't help myself
I can't do right for long
You know that

What God give me a brain for?
He knows that I can't use it
I don't know why he'd give me a plan for
He never lets me do it

You're gonna love me
I'm gonna make you
You're gonna love me
I'm gonna make you

"You, Mister"

I'm doing alright, most of the time
In fact, yesterday, I was even doing real well and I
Think that I might claim you as mine
So that my head can rest and everybody can tell, and I

Had a strange dream and I
Called you at night and I
Had to make known that I wasn't alright
And say that I had you on my mind
Had you on my mind

I make it a point to rest through my day
To close my eyes and visualize my troubles away and I
Think of you here and I close my eyes tight
Somehow the vision of you near makes me feel alright and I

Had a strange dream and I
Called you at night and I
Had to make known that I wasn't alright
And say that I had you on my mind
Had you on my mind

Had you on my mind
Had you on my mind
Had you on my mind

"Young And Beautiful"
(from "The Great Gatsby" soundtrack)

I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

Dear Lord, when I get to heaven
Please, let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that You'll let him in
Father, tell me if You can
All that grace, all that body
All that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful?

"Your Band Is All The Rage"

I think we're losing what we used to have, you know
You loved me better one year ago, oh
Don't let me down, don't let me down so low

But I won't be ashamed if you leave me
I won't be all that mad if you go
'Cause I know, yes I know

You always spending all that stupid time
With your band on the road
But your band is all the rage
So I've been told
But you can still come home
You can still come home when you want
And I won't be ashamed to take you back in
Won't be ashamed to put a kiss on your lips
'Cause I know, I know

Boy, don't call me up quickly on the phone
It's been five nights since I heard the tone of your voice
You act like everything's alright
But we both know, we both know that it's not
And it's far from ever being good again
Darling, I'm gonna love you forever
If you come back, I'll take you back in baby
Back in, baby, back in, back in

I love you more than I will even know
You're so special
I guess that's why you got it where you go
But when you get real big, baby
Remember that little old cowgirl
Waiting for you back in that Red River Valley
Waiting back in that Tallahassee
I love you

"Your Girl"

Carry me off the stage
I can't do this anymore
Been gone for 3 years
Is that enough for you boy?

Carry me to my bed, paint my toe nails blue
Tell me all about the things that you and I will never do

I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah

Carry me off the stage
Had too much to drink
Been on tour too long
And I've had too much time to think

Carry me to my bed
Lay me in a pillow town
Kiss me on my head
And remind me of the way we will not know

I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah

Late at night, baby you're my sign
Call me late if you wanna get high
Late at night, laying in Versailles
You and I get to know one another

Late at night, baby you're my sign
Call me late if you wanna get high
Late at night, baby you and I
Can get to know one another

Cause late at night, we have one life to kill
Oh you and I
Can get to know the thrill
Cause baby you're my sign
And I wanna get to know ya

I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah

(Ah)
(Ah)
(Ah)
