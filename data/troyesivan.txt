"The June Haverly"

June Haverly,
You always get your way,
But June Haverly,
Not today, no not today

You're on top of the world,
Just trynna stay on track,
And they'll kiss your feet while they stab your back,
And watch you started burn to blazing crying

June Haverly,
You always got your way,
But not today, no not today
No not today

June Haverly,
You're not to blame,
No not to blame
And June Haverly,
Don't be ashamed,
For all the pain

You're on top of the world,
Just trynna stay on track,
And they'll kiss your feet while they stab your back,
And watch you started burn to blazing crying

June Haverly,
We miss you so
Why'd you go?
Oh why'd you go?

You're on top of the world,
Just trynna stay on track,
And they'll kiss your feet while they stab your back,
And watch you started burn to blazing crying

June Haverly,
We miss you so
Why'd you go?
Oh why'd you go?

"She's 22"

Sheâs 22, and sheâs loving you
and youâll never know how it makes me blue,
does she make you happy?

Iâm holding on, to a thing thatâs wrong
cause we donât belong,
you like my songs and it makes me happy
does she make you happy?

You can throw away, every word I say

Iâm standing still, on this hidden hill,
and Iâm looking around for the right way down,
to your distant valley,
your flowers grow, in the frozen snow and Iâd like to know is it all a show,
are you really happy? [x2]

Cause you can throw away, every word I say
You just throw away

"Make You Love Me"

Well I can't make you love me, but I'll try
Oh the Lord knows how hard I'll try
I can't make you need me, but I'll try
Oh the Lord knows how hard I'll try

But when the su-u-u-un starts to set 
And when the ski-i-i-ies take your breath
And I need to sense you, right there
You just wave goodbye, wave goodbye

Well I can't make you love me, but I'll try
Until my dying breath, you know I'll try
I can't make you feel it, if it's not there
Only the Lord knows why it's not there

But when the su-u-u-un starts to set 
And when the ski-i-i-ies take your breath
And I need to sense you, right there
You just wave goodbye, wave goodbye

I can't make you love me, yeah
I can't make you love me 
(I can't make you love me)

But when the su-u-u-un starts to set 
And when the ski-i-i-ies take your breath
And I need to sense you, right there
You just wave goodbye, wave goodbye
(You just wave goodbye)

"Happy Little Pill"

In the crowd alone
And every second passing reminds me I'm not home
Bright lights and city sounds are ringing like a drone
Unknown, unknown

Oh, glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills
And...

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Tame my hunger
Light within
Numb my skin

Like a rock I float
Sweat and conversations seep into my bones
Four walls are not enough
I'll take a dip into the unknown, unknown

Oh, glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills
And...

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Tame my hunger
Light within
Numb my skin

Glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills
And...

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Tame my hunger
Light within
Numb my skin

"Touch"

Glow is low and it's dimming
And the silence is ringing
And I can almost feel your breath
I can almost feel the rest

Night is young and we're living
Hands move, moving steady
And the time is moving slower
I can feel we're getting closer, closer

Standing in the eye of the storm
My eyes start to roam
To the curl of your lips
In the center of eclipse
In total darkness I, I reach out and touch

My mind's gone on racing
On a horse that's escaping
And I'm ready to jump,
Yeah, I'm ready to swim

Life is chances that are taken
But nothing's ever broken
They're just pieces on the ground
New hands need to build them

My mind's gone on running
My hands cut loose
Yeah, but there's no need for answers
Just the things you gotta do

And I need you to trust
That I'm lost and we must
Get past all these rules
We must choose
To reach out and touch

Standing in the eye of the storm
My eyes start to roam
To the curl of your lips
In the center of eclipse
In total darkness I, reach out and...

Standing in the eye of the storm
My eyes start to roam
To the curl of your lips
In the center of eclipse
In total darkness I reach, I reach out and touch

"Fun"

But don't you wanna see the world, boy
All the countries and the stars, boy
Just don't look them in the eyes, boy
You just gotta take their lives, boy
Let me take you for a drive, boy
Oh I swear you'll feel alive, boy

All you gotta do is trust that I'm being true
And do it for the people who love you

Let's go have fun, you and me in the old Jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun
You and me in the old Jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun

Listen to what I tell you
You'll see, my son
Now you know what you gotta do
Let's go have fun

When you're standing on the line, boy
Don't go looking for goodbye, boy
Yeah, you gotta set them free, boy
'Cause you know that's what they need, boy
Yeah, you're gonna make them proud, boy
'Til they put you in the ground, boy

All you gotta do is trust that I'm being true
And do it for the people who love you

Let's go have fun, you and me in the old Jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun,
You and me in the old Jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun

Listen to what I tell you
You'll see, my son
Now you know what you gotta do
Let's go have fun
Let's go have fun

Let's go have fun, you and me in the old Jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun
You and me in the old Jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun

Fun, you and me in the old Jeep,
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun
You and me in the old Jeep
Ride around town with our rifles on the front seat
Fun, you and me in the Middle East
Shooting at rocks, bullets cocked in the midday sun

"Gasoline"

I smell heartbreak on my hands
I feel sick to my stomach as I begin to stand
I see your outline in my bed
In the same spot I watched him rest his head

I've done you wrong, I regret it
I write this song, try to forget it
I feel this emptiness in my chest
It feels surreal, but I'm feeling stressed

I need to do something
I fucked up for nothing
Now I gotta just tell someone
Tell someone what I've done

Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline
Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline
Oh, no, like gasoline

Wake up the morning after
You call but I don't answer
And I can't look you in the eye
No matter how hard I try

You deserve forever
not a boy looking for better
But as long as you're still here
I'mma try to keep you near

Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline
Bathe me now, yeah, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline

Please bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline
Bathe me now, yeah, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, like gasoline

Bathe me now, wash me clean
Just set my heart on fire, just like gasoline

"The Fault In Our Stars (MMXIV)"

[Verse 1:]
The weight
Of a simple human emotion
Weighs me down
More than the tank ever did

The pain
It's determined and demanding
To ache, but I'm okay...

[Chorus:]
And I don't want to let this go
I don't want to lose control
I just want to see the stars with you

And I don't want to say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just want to see the stars with you

[Verse 2:]
You lost, a part of your existence
In the war, against yourself
Oh, the lights,
They light up in lights of sadness
Telling you, it's time to go

[Chorus:]
And I don't want to let this go
I don't want to lose control
I just want to see the stars with you

And I don't want to say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just want to see the stars with you

[Bridge x3:]
Don't give it up just yet stay grand
For one more minute, don't give it up just yet
Stay grand

[Chorus:]
(I don't want to let) And I don't want to let this go
(I don't want to lose) I don't want to lose control
(And I just want to see) I just want to see the stars (the stars with you) with you

And I don't want to say (don't want to say) goodbye
Someone tell me why (tell me why)
I just want to see the stars (the stars with you) with you

With you

"WILD"

(Wild, wild, hey!)

Trying hard not to fall
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down, down
Kissing up on fences
And up on walls
On the way home
I guess it's all working out, now

'Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh

Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild

'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild

You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild

(Wild, wild, hey!)

White noise in my mind
Won't calm down
You're all I think about

Running on the music
And night highs
But when the light's out
It's me and you now, now

'Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild

'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild

You're driving me wild, wild, wild [4x]

You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild

You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild

(Hey)
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh (hey)
And it drives me wild (hey, hey)

'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh (hey)
It drives me wild (hey)

You're driving me wild, wild, wild [4x]
(Hey, hey)

(Wild, wild, wild, hey!)

"BITE"

Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Sing me like a choir
I can be the subject of your dreams
Your sickening desire
Don't you want to see a man up close?
A phoenix in the fire

So kiss me on the mouth and set me free
But please don't bite

You can coax the cold right out of me
Drape me in your warmth
The rapture in the dark puts me at ease
The blind eye of the storm
Let's go for a walk down Easy Street
Where you can be reborn

And kiss me on the mouth and set me free
But please, don't bite

Aah, I'm pulling on your heart to push my luck
Aah, cause who's got any time for growin' up?
Kiss me on the mouth... 
Kiss me on the mouth...
Kiss me, kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Kiss me on the mouth and set me free

Kiss me on the mouth and set me free
Sing me like a choir
I can be the subject of your dreams
Your sickening desire
Don't you wanna see a man up close
A phoenix in the fire

So kiss me on the mouth and set me free
But please don't bite

"FOOLS"

I am tired of this place, I hope people change
I need time to replace what I gave away
And my hopes, they are high, I must keep them small
Though I try to resist I still want it all

I see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
I see a little house on a hill and children's names
I see quiet nights poured over ice and Tanqueray
But everything is shattering and it's my mistake

Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

Oh, our lives don't collide, I'm aware of this
We've got differences and impulses and your obsession with
The little things, you like stick, and I like aerosol
I don't give a fuck, I'm not giving up, I still want it all

Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

I see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
I see a little house on a hill and children's names
I see quiet nights poured over ice and Tanqueray
But everything is shattering and it's my mistake

Only fools fall for you, only fools fall
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools fall
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools
Only fools
Only fools
Only fools

"EASE"
(feat. Broods)

[Troye Sivan:]
I'm down to my skin and bone
And my mommy, she can't put down the phone
And stop asking how I'm doing all alone, alone
But the truth is the stars are falling, ma
And the wolves are out c-calling, ma
And my home has never felt this far

[Troye Sivan & Georgia Nott:]
But all this driving
Is driving me crazy
And all this moving
Is proving to get the best of me
And I've been trying to hide it
But lately
Every time I think I'm better
Pickin' my head up, getting nowhere

[Troye Sivan & Georgia Nott:]
Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

[Troye Sivan & Georgia Nott:]
Now I'm down to my skin and bones
My baby listens to me on the phone
But I can't help feeling like I'm all alone, all alone
The truth is, the stars are falling, babe
And I'd never ever thought that I would say
I'm afraid of the life that I've made, I've made

[Troye Sivan & Georgia Nott:]
But all this driving
Is driving me crazy
And all this moving
Is proving to get the best of me
And I've been trying to hide it
But lately
Every time I think I'm better
Pickin' my head up, getting nowhere

Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

[Georgia Nott:]
I've been lyin' to them all
I don't need it anymore
Don't you worry about me
I'll be fine if I can breathe
I've been out here for too long
Taking shit for how I'm wrong
How I'm wrong
Always wrong

[Troye Sivan & Georgia Nott:]
Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
(Take me back to the basics and the simple life)
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
(Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease)
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
(Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby)
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

"THE QUIET"

Growing distance free of explanation
We're getting deeper in this mess
Take careful contemplation
I'd rather be spitting blood
Than have this silence fuck me up

This separation,
time and space between us
For some revelation
You didn't care to discuss
I'd rather be black and blue
Than accept that you withdrew

Aaah, just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet
Just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet

Used to give each other the world, every bit
I used to be the one you'd come to
When it'd all go to shit
Now I'm left here in the dust
With the taste of broken trust

And I don't wanna walk away
But you left me no choice
Only talking to myself here
Now you've muffled your voice
I'd rather have broken bones
Than feel myself turn to stone

Aaah, just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet
Just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet

I don't mind that I know that you're wrong
I don't mind that you think you're right
All I want is a fight to fight
Anything but quiet

Just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet

"DKLA"
(feat. Tkay Maidza)

Wrapped my thoughts around your mind
Wrapped your body around mine

Play it back then press rewind
To when you traced your fingers drew my spine
Lost its beat and so I find
I starve my heart of touch and time

So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around, love around
Love around, love around

When we tried it, we were a fire with no smoke
Rags to riches but I'm addicted to being broken
Take my breath away, you know I'm bound to choke
When I close my eyes I still see your ghost

So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around, love around
Love around, love around

I don't keep love around
I don't keep love around
Ooh yeah, I don't keep love around
Love around
Love around

[Tkay Maidza:]
They can't stand, I handstand
I don't hold on right anymore
Pleased to meet you, I'm kinda' moved
But that last one was my antidote
Green eyes, become green times
But there is no first or a last chance
They're telling me to turn down
'Cause I'm so lit, recall flashdance?
Only A1, and I stay 1
And I'm counting out for that day when
Residuals become imminent
'Cause failure is not pivotal
They just be asking the same
Try switch it up, I switch lanes
No love in this world, I'm still sane
Right? Because that's enough?
When the lights on
And you don't keep love

[Troye Sivan:]
'Distance makes the heart grow fonder'
Said by someone stronger than me
So what do I do now?
Do now?
So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around anymore
I don't keep love around anymore
I don't keep, I don't keep
Love around

I don't mind that you think you're right
All I want is a fight to fight
Anything but quiet

Just tell me
Say anything
Anything hurts less than the quiet

"DKLA"
(feat. Tkay Maidza)

Wrapped my thoughts around your mind
Wrapped your body around mine

Play it back then press rewind
To when you traced your fingers drew my spine
Lost its beat and so I find
I starve my heart of touch and time

So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around, love around
Love around, love around

When we tried it, we were a fire with no smoke
Rags to riches but I'm addicted to being broken
Take my breath away, you know I'm bound to choke
When I close my eyes I still see your ghost

So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around
What do I do now?
I don't keep love around, love around
Love around, love around

I don't keep love around
I don't keep love around
Ooh yeah, I don't keep love around
Love around
Love around

[Tkay Maidza:]
They can't stand, I handstand
I don't hold on right anymore
Pleased to meet you, I'm kinda' moved
But that last one was my antidote
Green eyes, become green times
But there is no first or a last chance
They're telling me to turn down
'Cause I'm so lit, recall flashdance?
Only A1, and I stay 1
And I'm counting out for that day when
Residuals become imminent
'Cause failure is not pivotal
They just be asking the same
Try switch it up, I switch lanes
No love in this world, I'm still sane
Right? Because that's enough?
When the lights on
And you don't keep love

[Troye Sivan:]
'Distance makes the heart grow fonder'
Said by someone stronger than me
So what do I do now?
Do now?
So what do I do now?
I don't keep love around anymore
I don't keep love around anymore
I don't keep, I don't keep
Love around

"TALK ME DOWN"

I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now
And I wanna come home to you
But home is just a room full of my safest sounds
Cause you know that I can't trust myself with my 3AM shadow
I'd rather fuel a fantasy than deal with this alone

I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now
So come over now and talk me down

I wanna hold hands with you
But that's all I wanna do right now
And I wanna get close to you
Cause your hands and lips still know their way around
And I know I like to draw that line, when it starts to get too real
But the less time that I spend with you, the less you need to heal

I wanna sleep next to you
But that's all I wanna do right now
So come over now and talk me down
(talk me down)

So if you don't mind, I'll walk that line
Stuck on the bridge between us
Gray areas and expectations
But I'm not the one if we're honest, yeah
But I wanna sleep next to you
And I wanna come home to you
I wanna hold hands with you
I wanna be close to you

But I wanna sleep next to you
And that's all I wanna do right now
And I wanna come home to you
But home is just a room full of my safest sounds
So come over now and talk me down
(talk me down)

"COOL"

Sweet life livin'
Pools and swimming
Drinks in bars and
Boys in cars and
Rooftop sinning
Skinny dipping
Shooting stars
With fat cigars

And that weekend up in the islands
They stop and stare
Flashes filling the silence
Of a Hollywood love affair
Waking up in the islands
Cause I saw you there
Lost and trying to be

I was just trying to be cool
I was just trying to be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?

Mansion debut
Love it, do you?
Absent father
Pays his daughter
And her mama withdrew
From the life they once knew
She had a heart, but
She sold it off for

That weekend up in the islands
They stop and stare
Flashes filling the silence
Of a Hollywood love affair
Waking up in the islands
Cause I saw you there
Lost and trying to be

I was just trying to be cool
I was just trying to be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?

When I've got that cigarette smoke
And Saint Laurent coat, but nothing is feeling right
I drink but I choke
I love but I don't, yeah

I was just trying to be cool
I was just trying to be like you

I was just trying to be cool
I was just trying to be like you
I'm a spark and you're a boom
What am I supposed to do?

When I've got that cigarette smoke
And Saint Laurent coat, but nothing is feeling right
I drink but I choke
I love but I don't, yeah

I was just trying to be cool
I was just trying to be like you

"HEAVEN"
(feat. Betty Who)

The truth runs wild
Like a tear down a cheek
Trying to save face, and daddy heart break
I'm lying through my teeth

This voice inside
Has been eating at me
Trying to replace the love that I fake
With what we both need

The truth runs wild
Like kids on concrete
Trying to sedate my mind in its cage
And numb what I see

Awake, wide eyed
I'm screaming at me
Trying to keep faith and picture his face
Staring up at me

Without losing a piece of me
How do I get to heaven?
Without changing a part of me
How do I get to heaven?
All my time is wasted
Feeling like my heart's mistaken, oh
So if I'm losing a piece of me
Maybe I don't want heaven?

[Betty Who:]
The truth runs wild
Like the rain to the sea
Trying to set straight the lines that I trace
To find some relief
This voice inside
Has been eating at me

Trying to embrace the picture I paint
And colour me free

Without losing a piece of me
How do I get to heaven?
Without changing a part of me
How do I get to heaven?
All my time is wasted
Feeling like my heart's mistaken, oh
So if I'm losing a piece of me
Maybe I don't want heaven?

So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen, counting to fifteen
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen, counting to fifteen
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen, counting to fifteen
So I'm counting to fifteen
Counting to fifteen, counting to fifteen

Without losing a piece of me
How do I get to heaven?
Without changing a part of me
How do I get to heaven?
All my time is wasted
Feeling like my heart's mistaken, oh
So if I'm losing a piece of me
Maybe I don't want heaven?

The truth runs wild
Like a tear down a cheek

"YOUTH"

What if
What if we run away
What if
What if we left today
What if
We said goodbye to safe and sound
What if
What if we're hard to find
What if
What if we lost our minds
What if
We let them fall behind, and they're never found

And when the lights start flashing like a photo booth
And the stars exploding
We'll be fireproof

My youth
My youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth
My youth is yours
Run away now and forevermore
My youth
My youth is yours
The truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

What if
What if we start to drive
What if
What if we close our eyes
What if
We're speeding through red lights into paradise
'Cause we've no time for getting old
Mortal body, timeless souls
Cross your fingers, here we go
Oh, oh, oh

And when the lights start flashing like a photo booth
And the stars exploding
We'll be fireproof

My youth
My youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth
My youth is yours
Run away now and forevermore
My youth
My youth is yours
The truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours
My youth is yours

My youth
My youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth
My youth is yours
Run away now and forevermore
My youth
My youth is yours
The truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours
Oh, oh, oh
My youth is yours
Oh, oh, oh
My youth is yours

"LOST BOY"

As the smile fell from your face, I fell with it
Our faces blue
There's a heart stain on the carpet
I left it, I left it with you

Yeah, the truth is that I'm sorry
Though I told you not to worry
I'm just some dumb kid
Trying to kid myself
That I got my shit together

So go get runnin', won't you hurry?
While it's light out, while it's early
Before I start to miss any part of this
And change my mind, whatever

I say I wanna settle down
Build your hopes up like a tower
I'm giving you the run around
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found
Not ready to be found
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found

I don't care much for locks on the window
To keep me at bay
I'll leave you one last kiss on your pillow
'Fore I fly away

Yeah, we knew from the beginning
That this wasn't never ending
Shouldn't stay too long
'Cause we're both too young
To give into forever

I say I wanna settle down
Build your hopes up like a tower
I'm giving you the run around
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found
Not ready to be found
I'm just a lost boy

So what are you waiting for?
'Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy

So what are you waiting for?
'Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy

So what are you waiting for?
'Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy

So what are you waiting for?
'Cause someone could love you more
I'm just a lost boy, lost boy

I say I wanna settle down
Build your hopes up like a tower
I'm giving you the run around
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found
Not ready to be found
I'm just a lost boy
Not ready to be found

"for him."
(feat. Allday)

We are runnin' so fast
And we never look back
And whatever I lack, you make up
We make a really good team
Though not everyone sees
We got this crazy chemistry
Between us

Jump starting your car 'cause this city's a bore
Buying e-cigarettes at the convenience store
Making new clichÃ©s on our own little tour
Let's ride

You don't have to say, "I love you," to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you, you

We try staying up late
But we both are light weights
Yeah we get off our face, too easy
And we take jokes way too far
'Cause sometimes living's too hard
We're like two halves of one heart
We are, we are, we are

You don't have to say, "I love you," to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you, you

[Verse three by AllDay:]
Eat a pill stay and chill, you don't need to go
I'm about to bring emo back if you leave my home
I'd Panic! at the Disco and you'd rather watch a TV show
Then I'll squeeze your booty real hard like I'm kneading dough
Pizza boy, I'm speeding for ya
We can get married tonight if you really wanna
Me in a cheap suit like a sleazy lawyer
And if you break this little heart, it'd be an honour

[Alternative verse three by Troye Sivan:]
We're not a commercial for anyone else
We go out for coffee
And keep it to ourselves
We make little homes out of three-star hotels
And I know what you're feeling
'Cause I feel it as well

You don't have to say, "I love you," to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars and all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey, don't need money
All I need is you
All I need is you, you

"SUBURBIA"

[Verse 1:]
The sun sets longer
Where I am from
Where dreams go to die
While having fun
The boys fix their cars and
Girls eat it up
Loving's so good when
Love is young

[Pre-Chorus:]
Yeah, there's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
There's so much history in my head
The people I've left
The ones that I've kept

[Chorus:]
Have you heard me on the radio?
Did you turn it up?
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Of suburbia

[Verse 2:]
Swallow nostalgia
Chase it with lime
Better than dwelling
And chasing time
Missing occasions
I can't rewind
Can't help but feel I've lost what's mine

[Pre-Chorus:]
Yeah, there's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
There's so much history in my head
The people I've left
The ones that I've kept

[Chorus:]
Have you heard me on the radio?
Did you turn it up?
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Of suburbia

[Bridge:]
They all say that nothing ever changes
Through the new lines that are on their faces
They all say that nothing ever changes
Through the new lines that are on their faces

[Pre-Chorus:]
Yeah, there's so much history in these streets
And mama's good eats
Oh Wonder on repeat
There's so much history in my head
The people I've left
The ones that I've kept

[Chorus:]
Have you heard me on the radio?
Did you turn it up?
On your blown-out stereo
In suburbia
Could be playing hide and seek from home
Can't replace my blood
Yeah, it seems I'm never letting go
Of suburbia

"TOO GOOD"

Scared my love, you'll go
Spend my love, heart broke
So my love don't show
Scared my love, you'll go

Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
All I need

Fingers walk your thigh
Breathe my love, get high
And oh, I'm so scared
Oh I'm so scared
It's just for tonight

So I take a sip, wait 'til it hits
That liquid guilt is on my lips
I'm wasted on you

Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
All I need

So I take a sip, wait 'til it hits
That liquid guilt is on my lips
I'm wasted on you
(Wasted on you)

Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
Too good to be good for me
Too bad that that's all I need
All I need

"BLUE"
(feat. Alex Hope)

Love hits hard, I know
All your lights are red, but I'm green to go
Used to see you high, now you're only low
All your lights are red but I'm green to go

I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you
I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you

I can't say no
Though the lights are on
There's nobody home
Swore I'd never lose control
Then I fell in love with a heart that beats so slow

I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you
I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you

I know you're seeing black and white
So I'll paint you a clear blue sky
Without you I am colour-blind
It's raining every time I open my eyes
I know you're seeing black and white
So I'll paint you a clear blue sky
Without you I am colour-blind
It's raining every time I open my eyes

I want you
I'll colour me blue
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you
When I'm looking up at you

I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you
I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you

I want you
I'll colour me blue
Anything it takes to make you stay
Only seeing myself
When I'm looking up at you

"WILD (XXYYXX Remix)"

(Heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me)

Trying hard not to fall
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down
Kissing up on fences
And up on walls
On the way home
I guess it's all working out, now

'Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

You're driving me

White noise in my mind
Won't calm down
You're all I think about
Running on the music
And night highs
But when the light's out
It's me and you now, now

'Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Wanted to
Wanted to be, be, bad
Never, ever
Driving me wild
Wanted to
Wanted to be, be, bad

"SWIMMING POOLS"

I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run

So tell me how I'm gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools
Cause I just wanna be at the start of after loving you
I plant my feet and I clench my teeth
I can't outrun what's coming after me
So tell me how I'm gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools

But I see a lighthouse in the distance calling my name
But I can't get there 'til I go through all of this pain
There's a glimmer of hope like an exhale of smoke in the sky
And sometimes you drain out all the shit that used to feel right
Empty swimming pools

I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run

So tell me how I'm gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools
Tell me how I'm gonna feel less secure when I look at you
So I close my eyes and just visualize
The greenest grass on the other side
So tell me how I'm gonna get past this wave to empty swimming pools

But I see a lighthouse in the distance calling my name
But I can't get there 'til I go through all of this pain
There's a glimmer of hope like an exhale of smoke in the sky
And sometimes you drain out all the shit that used to feel right
Empty swimming pools
Empty swimming pools
Empty swimming pools
Empty swimming pools

I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run
I've been running, running, run

"EASE (Vallis Alps Remix)"
(feat. Broods)

Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

I'm down to my skin and bone
And my mommy, she can't put down the phone
And stop asking how I'm doing all alone, alone
But the truth is the stars are falling, ma
And the wolves are out calling, ma
And my home has never felt this far

But all this driving
Is driving me crazy
And all this moving
Is proving to get the best of me
And I've been trying to hide it
But lately
Every time I think I'm better
Pickin' my head up, getting nowhere

Take me back to the basics and the simple life
Tell me all of the things that make you feel at ease
Your touch, my comfort, and my lullaby
Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night
The truth is...

(I've been lying to them all
I don't need it anymore
Don't you worry about me
I'll be fine if I can breath
I've been hidin' for too long
Taking shit for how I'm wrong
How I'm wrong
Always wrong)

Holdin' on tight and sleepin' at night

Now I'm down to my skin and bones
My baby listens to me on the phone
But I can't help feeling like I'm all alone, all alone
The truth is, the stars are falling, babe
And I'd never ever thought that I would say
I'm afraid of the life that I've made, I've made

But all this driving
Is driving me crazy
And all this moving
Is proving to get the best of me
And I've been trying to hide it
But lately
Every time I think I'm better
Pickin' my head up, getting nowhere

Take me back to the basics and the simple life

I've never ever wanted to be so bad
And it drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild

You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild

Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good
And it drives me wild
'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad
And it drives me wild

You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild

Wild
Wild
Wild, Hey!

"WILD (Young Bombs Remix)"
(feat. Alessia Cara & Young Bombs)

Trying hard not to fall
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down, down
Kissing up on fences
And up on walls
On the way home
I guess it's all working out, now

Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh

Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild

We're alike you and I
Two blue hearts locked in our wrong minds
So can we make the most out of no time?
Can you hold me?
Can you make me leave my demons and my broken pieces behind?

Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild

You're driving me...
You're driving me...
You're driving me...
You're driving me...
You're driving me wild

"FOOLS (Filous Remix)"

I am tired of this place, I hope people change
I need time to replace what I gave away
And my hopes, they are high, I must keep them small
Though I try to resist I still want it all

I see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
I see a little house on the hill and children's names
I see quiet nights poured over ice and Tanqueray
But everything is shattering and it's my mistake

Only fools...
(You, you, you)

Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

I am tired of this place, I hope people change
I need time to replace what I gave away
And my hopes, they are high, I must keep them small
Though I try to resist I still want it all

I see swimming pools and living rooms and aeroplanes
I see a little house on the hill and children's names
I see quiet nights poured over ice and Tanqueray
But everything is shattering and it's my mistake

Only fools...
(You, you, you)

Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

(You, you, you)

Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall
Only fools fall for you, only fools
Only fools do what I do, only fools fall

(feat. Gryffin)

What if, what if we run away?
What if, what if we left today?
What if we said goodbye to safe and sound?
And what if, what if we're hard to find?
What if, what if we lost our minds?
What if we let them fall behind and they're never found?

And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding, weâll be fireproof

My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls
My youth, my youth is yours
Runaway now and forevermore
My youth, my youth is yours
A truth so loud you can't ignore
My youth, my youth, my youth
My youth is yours

What if, what if we start to drive?
What if, what if we close our eyes?
What if we're speeding through red lights into paradise?
Cause we've no time for getting old
Mortal body; timeless souls
Cross your fingers, here we go

And when the lights start flashing like a photobooth
And the stars exploding, weâll be fireproof

My youth, my youth is yours
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls

"Happy Little Pill (Live)"

In the crowd, alone
And every second passing
Reminds me I'm not home
Bright lights and city sounds
Are ringing like a drone
Unknown, unknown

All glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills and

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin

Like a rock, I float
Sweat and conversations
Seep into my bone
Four walls are not enough
I'll take a dip into the
Unknown, unknown

All glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills and

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin, yeah

Bright lights, remember bright lights, bright lights
These bright lights, see these bright lights bright lights
Yeah all of these bright lights, they numb my skin
Oh yeah

Oh, all the glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, and dollar bills and

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring colour to my skies
My sweet little pill
Take my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin baby

Bright lights, remember bright lights, bright lights
Yeah all of these bright lights, they numb my skin
Oh, oh, I see again

"Seventeen"

I got these beliefs that I think you wanna break
Got something here to lose that I think you wanna take from me
You say that I'm asleep but I wanna be awake
Got something here to lose that I know you wanna take

And he said age is just a number, just like any other
We can do whatever, do whatever you want
Boy becomes a man now
Can't tell a man to slow down
He'll just do whatever, do whatever he wants

I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, seventeen

You should know I'm green but I'll find my way around
Heard the whispers, now let's see what all the talk's about
I'm taking in the sights and measuring the sounds
Heard the whispers, now let's see what all the talk's about

And he said age is just a number, just like any other
We can do whatever, do whatever you want
Boy becomes a man now
Can't tell a man to slow down
He'll just do whatever, do whatever he wants

I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, seventeen...

I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, seventeen
I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, seventeen...

"MY MY MY!"

Shine on, diamond
Don't make me wait another day
'Cause passion is passion
You know it just as well as me

Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move

Spark up, buzz cut
I got my tongue between your teeth
Go slow, no, no, go fast
You like it just as much as me

Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

Oh my, my, my

Living for your every move

Should be the last night ever
Should be the last night we're apart
Got my name on this treasure
On this treasure

Oh my, my, my

"The Good Side"

I got the good side of things
Left you with both of the rings
My fingers danced and swayed in the breeze
The change in the wind took you down to your knees
I got the good side of you
Send it out into the blue
The people danced to the sound of your heart
The world sang along to it falling apart

But I sympathize
And I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

I got the good side of life
Travelled the universe twice
So many thoughts I wanted to share
But I didn't call because it wouldn't be fair
Then I got the good side of new
Found arms to fall right into
I know how it looked, it wasn't the plan
And some day I hope that you'll understand

That I sympathize
And I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

I'm sure we'll meet in the spring
And catch up on everything
I'll say I'm proud of all that you've done
You taught me the ropes, and you taught me to love

But I sympathize
And I recognize
And baby, I apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things
Sympathize
Recognize
Apologize
That I got the good side
The good side of things

The fountains and the waters
Are begging just to know ya

"Postcard"
(feat. Gordi)

I sent you a postcard from Tokyo baby
You never picked it up
I even wrote it in Japanese, baby
You didn't give a fuck

'Cause I don't sleep like your body's on me
I won't feel right until we can be
Underneath everything that's between, yeah
I'm undone about to burst at my seams
'Cause I am picturing you beside me
So let me be everything that you need, yeah

But you're still picking me up
Don't put me back down like it's nothing to ya
You're still picking me up
Don't you put me back down
Don't you put me back down
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya

I remember that night when you first called me crazy
Only you picked it up
Kissed me and said "I love you, baby"
You didn't give a fuck

Now I don't sleep unless your body's on me
I won't feel right until we can be
Underneath everything that's between, yeah
I'm undone about to burst at my seams
'Cause I am picturing you beside me
So let me be everything that you need, yeah

But you're still picking me up
Don't put me back down like it's nothing to ya
You're still picking me up
Don't you put me back down
Don't you put me back down
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya

Take your time
Pull me in, push me out
Simplify all the whispers you doubt
'Cause I know what you're thinking about

But you're still picking me up
Don't put me back down like it's nothing to ya
You're still picking me up
Don't you put me back down
Don't you put me back down
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya
Like it's nothing to ya

"Plum"

Watching you sleep
Run my hands through your hair and it's got me thinking
What you mean to me
There's a chill in the air and a sinking feeling
Coming over me
Like bitter tangerine
Like sirens in the streets
Oh no

Maybe our time has come
Maybe we're overgrown
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
Baby, we're barely holding on
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long

Jealous you can sleep
You've been keeping me up and I mouth the words
I think I wanna speak
Instead I'm wasting my time just pressing rewind
To all the nights we shared
The ripest peach or pear
But change is in the air, oh

Maybe our time has come
Maybe we're overgrown
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
Baby, we're barely holding on
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long

I was summer, you were spring
You can't change what the seasons bring
Yeah, I was summer and you were spring
You can't change what the seasons bring

Maybe our time has come
Maybe we're overgrown
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
Baby, we're barely holding on
Even the sweetest plum
Has only got so long
...

"What A Heavenly Way To Die"

Tell each other you're the one
While we're laying by the poolside, poolside
Getting tired from the sun
Fading in and out of long nights, long nights
There's no limit to your love
East or west we got the north lights, north lights, oh-oh
Take in it a-all

What a heavenly way to die
What a time to be alive
Because forever is in your eyes
But forever ain't half the time

I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you

When our prime has come and gone
And our youth is all but melted, melted
We can listen to this song
So we don't have to accept it, accept it
Just as long as you'll be home
In the one we've manifested-fested
Oh-oh, just take in it a-all

What a heavenly way to die
What a time to be alive
Because forever is in your eyes
But forever ain't half the time

I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you

Just take in it all-all-all-all
Just take in it all-all-all-all
Just take in it all-all-all-all
Just take in it all-all-all-all

What a heavenly way to die
What a time to be alive
Because forever is in your eyes
But forever ain't half the time

I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you

"Lucky Strike"

Oh, I want to know just how to love you
The jewel of California
Oh, I want to skip stones on your skin, boy
And drown me in your water

And my boy like a queen
Unlike one you've ever seen
He knows how to love me better
A hit of dopamine, higher than I've ever been
He knows how to love me better

Cause you're safe like spring time
Short days, long nights, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you
Cause you taste like Lucky Strikes
You drag, I light, boy
Tell me all the ways to love you
Tell me all the ways to love you
Tell me all the ways to love you

Oh, I wanna tip toe through your bliss, boy
Get lost the more I find ya
Oh (na na na na), don't wanna miss a second of this, boy
Hold tight and love me longer

And my boy like a queen
Unlike one you've ever seen
He knows how to love me better
A hit of dopamine, higher than I've ever been

"Animal"

I told you something safe
Something I've never said before
And I, I, I, can't keep my hands off you
While you lie in the wake
Covered all in the night before
I'm high, high, high, no one's got me quite like you

I want you all to myself
Don't leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
No angels could beckon me back
And it's hotter than hell where I'm at
I am an animal with you

An ode to the boy I love
Boy I'll die to care for you
You're mine, mine, mine, tell me who do I owe that to
And as the days fly by
We'll be more than getting through, yeah
And in time, time, time, we'll build a home for two

I want you all to myself
Don't leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
No angels could beckon me back
It's hotter than hell where I'm at
I am an animal with you

All is right in the meadow
When I'm lying next to my fellow
Baby that's you
Baby that's you
One way trip like an arrow
All laid out like a tarot
Baby that's you
Baby that's you

I want you all to myself
Don't leave none for nobody else
I am an animal with you
No angels could beckon me back
And it's hotter than hell where I'm at
I am an animal with you

"This This"

Babe, you know I regret those words
Bombs that you did not deserve
Well alright, alright
And hey, usually just takes a day
Before we're on a brand new page
Alright, well that's fine

We turn in our apologies for peace of mind
Taking in this moment where it's all alright, it's alright

So how do we keep this this?
How do we keep this bliss?
How do we?
How do we stay this close?
I don't want to let go (how do we?)
So how do we keep this this?

I don't want to let go (how do we?)
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this
Keep it just like this

Ties can tangle up and become knots
Gotta work so that we don't get caught
Alright, alright
And I will take myself to the front line
Don't care if it's talking all night
It's alright, it's alright

We turn in our apologies for peace of mind
Taking in this moment where it's all alright, it's all alright

So how do we keep this this?

"Running Shoes"

I'll keep wearing these running shoes 'til I'm all worn out
And they're no use to me
No use to me
Gunning for a peace from this abuse
'Cause I'm all tired out and I'm no use to you
No use to you

And there's no rest for the wicked
So I'm screaming and I'm kicking to sleep
To sleep
The beliefs they're instilling
On the boys, on the children
On me, on me

I've been running, I've been running for a while
For a while
I've been running, I've been running for a while
For a while

These running shoes weigh me down
These running shoes are wearing out
This running

Carved his name in the carpet
Right where I spent all of my sleepless nights in that room
In that room
Can't get his face out of my mind
And God knows that I've tried and tried for you

And there's no rest for the wicked
So I'm screaming and I'm kicking to sleep
To sleep
The beliefs they're instilling
On the boys, on the children
On me, on me

I've been running, I've been running for a while
(Running, running)
For a while
(Running, running)
I've been running, I've been running for a while
(Running, running)
For a while
(Running, running)

These running shoes weigh me down
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
(Running, running)
(Running, running)
These running shoes weigh me down
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
(Running, running)
(Running, running)

Love in America got me down
Try to take off running but hit the ground

These running shoes weigh me down
(I've been running, I've been running for a while)
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
These running shoes weigh me down
(I've been running, I've been running for a while)
These running shoes are wearing out
This running
These running shoes weigh me down

"Seventeen (Reprise)"

I got these beliefs that I think you wanna break
Got something here to lose that I think you wanna take from me
You say that I'm asleep but I wanna be awake
Got something here to lose that I know you wanna take

And he said age is just a number, just like any other
We can do whatever, do whatever you want
Boy becomes a man now
Can't tell a man to slow down
He'll just do whatever, do whatever he wants

Here he comes
Like he just walked out of a dream
Doesn't care you're seventeen
Or maybe he forgot what that means
But yeah, he comes
He comes

"Take Yourself Home"

I'm tired of the city
Scream if you're with me
If I'm gonna die
Let's die somewhere pretty (Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Sad in the summer
City needs a mother
If I'm gonna waste my time
Then it's time to go
Take yourself home

Talk to me
There's nothing that can't be fixed with some honesty
And how it got this dark is just beyond to me
If anyone can hear me switch the lights (Lights, lights, lights)
Oh-oh-oh-oh

And happiness
Is right there where you lost it
When you took the bet
Counting all the losses that you can't collect
Got everything and nothing in my life

I'm tired of the city
Scream if you're with me
If I'm gonna die
Let's die somewhere pretty (Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Sad in the summer
City needs a mother
If I'm gonna waste my time then it's time to go
Take yourself home
Take yourself home

Who you really tryna be when they see your face?
Is it worth it trying to win in a losing game?
Well it's all waiting for you
And, boy, I know you're eager
But it just might destroy you
Destroy you, yeah

I'm tired of the city
Scream if you're with me
If I'm gonna die
Let's die somewhere pretty (Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

Sad in the summer
City needs a mother
If I'm gonna waste my time then it's time to go
Take yourself home
Take yourself home
Take yourself home

"Easy"

You ran away to find something to say
I went astray to make it okay, and he made it easy, darlin'
I'm still in love and I say that because
I know how it seems between you and me, it hasn't been easy, darlin'

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo!
Burning the tears right off my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy
Easy
Please don't leave me
Leave me

What's left of the dance? That's all on my hands
The rock in my throat, a hair on my coat
The stranger at home, my darlin'
(Like some kind of freak, my darlin')
Now I'm vulnerable, so sad and alone
But don't cry for me, 'cause everyone knows
You reap what you sow, my darlin'
Uh-yeah, yeah, yeah

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo!
Burning the tears right off my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy
Easy
Please don't leave me
Don't leave me

(He made it easy)
(Please don't leave me)
(He made it easy)
(Please don't leave me)

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo!
Burning the tears right off my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy
Easy
Please don't leave me, no
Don't leave me

(He made it easy)
(Please don't leave me)
(He made it easy)
(Please don't leave me)

"could cry just thinkin about you"

Now I'm knee-deep in this mess
I could cry just thinking about you
Every line I write is something about you
Every guy I want looks something just like you
Every book I read I only read for you
Every art piece is just to remind you
I don't know who I am with, or without you
But I guess I'm bout to find out
I, I, I

"STUD"

Hey, stud, you can come
And you can come and meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love

Hey, tough, what's it like to be so big and strong and so buff?
Everything I'm not, but could I still be a hunk to you?
Enough for you
A stud to you

Takin' the fun out of fucks
Searchin' for something I'm not
Knowin' that you're not the one
(But you're the one for right now, yeah)

How much of me would you take?
And how much of me would you change?
On second thought, don't say a thing
('Cause you're the one for right now)

At seven hundred miles down highways to Eden

"IN A DREAM"

I think about it
Can't think about it
Took a flight all the way home, yeah, ooh
No way around it
I still see you way up here, yeah

I'm stressed about it
Went West about it
Took a hammer to my phone, yeah, ooh
The way you run it
I still hear you crystal clear

But I won't let you in again
I'm gonna lock the doors and hide my shit
'Cause my spirit's wearing thin
And there's only so much I can give
I won't let you in again
That's the hardest thing I've ever said
You know, that's the hardest thing I've said

Guess I might understand it
If you don't listen to me
But I thought it was obvious
That you don't show up in a dream
Guess I even forgive you
For you not wanting to leave, no, no, no
Put my shoes on and run away
You still show up in a dream
Only making this harder
'Cause I still have to see your, see your face, yeah

Can you come back?
Wait, I don't mean that, no
It's all just feeling real now, ooh
So far away, but I still feel you everywhere

"What's The Time Where You Are?"

God, I wish it was you

Tokyo just hit me like a wave
Where we ended up, I couldn't say
I'm feelin' like my head's just in a distant time and place
I hope that I got you
The way that you got me, baby

And I spent so long just waiting for the signs
Thought I'd lost my every feeling on the ride
Then oh, you showed, and that's just the way love goes
Now the only thing I wanna know

Is what's the time where you are, you are?
What's the night like where you are, you are?
International straight shot to my heart
I'm right on top of this groove
(Groove)
But God, I wish it was you
(You)

Is it better where you are, you are?
What's the weather where you are, you are?
International through line to my heart
This beat is making me move
(Move)
But God, I wish it was you
(You)
God, I wish it was you

Open invite if you wanna come
(If you wanna come)
'Cause I'm everywhere, you'd think I'm on the run
I'm okay with waiting if, when all is said and all is done

You know that I got you
The way that you got me, baby

And I spent so long just waiting for the signs
Thought I'd lost my every feeling on the ride
Then oh, you showed, that's just the way love goes

"One Of Your Girls"

Everybody loves you, baby
You should trademark your face
Lining down the block to be around you
But baby, I'm first in place

Face card, no cash, no credit
Yes, God, don't speak, you said it
Look at you
Skip the application, interview
Sweet like Marabou
Look, look at you

Give me a call if you ever get lonely
I'll be like one of your girls or your homies
Say what you want, and I'll keep it a secret
You get the key to my heart, and I need it
Give me a call if you ever get desperate
I'll be like one of your girls

Everybody wants you, baby
Everybody
You should insure that waist
With the highest policy you can get
But nobody wants you bad as I do
Baby, let me plead my case

Face card, no cash, no credit
Yes, God, don't speak, you said it
Look at you
Pop the culture, iconography
Is standing right in front of me
Look, look at you

Give me a call if you ever get lonely
I'll be like one of your girls or your homies
Say what you want, and I'll keep it a secret
You get the key to my heart, and I need it
Give me a call if you ever get desperate
I'll be like one of your girls

Give me a call if you ever get desperate
I'll be like one of your girls

"In My Room"
(feat. Guitarricadelafuente)

Confundo la realidad
Y es que todo me extasÃ­a
Se ha encendido el cielo
Se te enreda el pelo
Tus espuelas con las mÃ­as

So in my head
And I leave it like an unmade bed
Oh, I don't wanna clean up yet
Keep it messy, messy, messy, aww-yeah

Se ha encendido el cielo
Se te enreda el pelo
Tus espuelas con las mÃ­as

Am I fucking sixteen?
This shit's kinda depressing
All you're doing to me
'Cause you mess me, test me, wreck me, aww-yeah
Maybe it's just admiration, copulation, or
Adoration, no defence, infatuation, aww-yeah

I'm all alone in my room
I'm just thinking 'bout you
It's a feeling I can't describe
Maybe it's just admiration, copulation, or
Adoration, no defence, infatuation, aww-yeah

Confundo la realidad

Keep it messy, messy, messy, aww-yeah

Se ha encendido el cielo
Se te enreda el pelo
Tus espuelas con las mÃ­as

Y aunque estÃ© partida
Tu mirada es genuina
SÃ© que estÃ¡s pensando
Carnavaleando

Has dado en el blanco
Dientes en el canto
Que la carne frÃ­a
Es fina peleterÃ­a

I'm all alone in my room
I'm just thinking 'bout you
It's a feeling I can't describe
Maybe it's just admiration, copulation, or
Adoration, no defence, infatuation, aww-yeah

We got something to give each other

"Still Got It"

Cut my hair into a bowl
After you told me that you liked it like that
Wish I didn't care at all
But now I'm in the mirror with scissors in hand

I saw you at a party, said hello like an old colleague
Talked about the summer when we didn't know each other

Was bound to happen, I suppose
But fuck me, now I really know
Yeah, I know

I still got it bad
I still got it bad
'Cause you've got what you had
And I still want it, I still want it, and I still want it bad

Getting used to being alone
But babe, a house don't mean a home like before, no
Got a place back in Australia
It's different than you remember
I think you'd like it though

You touched me in the back seat
Of the party bus on 10th Street
Kinda confused me
Both a couple drinks in too deep, it

Was bound to happen, I suppose
But fuck me, now I really know
Yeah, I know

I still got it bad
I still got it bad
'Cause you've got what you had
And I still want it, I still want it, and I still want it bad

We lost what we had
And now I want it, now I want it, now I want it back
'Cause you still got it

"Can't Go Back, Baby"

Can't go back, baby
Can't go back, baby
I wish I could, but I can't go
Can't go back, baby
To the days when I thought I knew ya

This is me you're talking about
Your only friend
Put your love into the ground
On my big weekend
While I was singing songs about you
On the TV screen
Don't know how he left the hotel
I wasn't there to see

In the morning
Your hands around my waist
Just us two
In the evening
On my mouth, could you still taste him?

Can't go back, baby
I wish I could, but I can't go
Can't go back, baby
To the days when I thought I knew ya
Can't go back, baby
You wish you could, but you can't go
Can't go back, baby

I wish you weren't dead to me
So much to miss in you
More than just my enemy
You were my lover, too

And I hope you forgive yourself
Because I swear I do
And it breaks my heart to say
I can't wait to live without you

In the morning, yeah, I wake up
With the sun across my face
In the evening, yeah, I lay with
So much love to take your place, and now I

Can't go back, baby
I wish I could, but I can't go
Can't go back, baby
To the days when I thought I knew ya
Can't go back, baby
You wish you could, but you can't go
Can't go back, baby

"Got Me Started"

He's got the personality, not even gravity could ever hold him down
He's got the sexuality of a man who can take a room and drown it out
Yeah

We should experiment even to the detriment of whoever's on the couch (Oh, yeah)

Inchin' closer to sunrise
Now we're layin' side by side

"Silly"

I'm still in it like that
Baby, I'm a love junkie like that
I'm so silly like that
Can you hit me back?
'Cause you really know me
But, you don't wanna know me

All the bodies on the floor collide
Everybody's out here looking right
The party's the only place that really knows me
I'm just tryna get outside of this body

I still love you more than I should say
I'm just tryna put that ... away
Don't need anybody here to console me
I'm just tryna get outside of this

I'm so silly like that
Boy, can you hit me back?
'Cause you really know me
Yeah, but you don't wanna know me

Alterate my mind to be like you
There's only so much a party can work out, a party could do
I don't need anybody here to console me
I'm just tryna get outside of this

I'm just recreating you
I'm working with what I got
Fill up my cup and shoot
Yeah, I just
Gotta rewire my desire, getting me higher
And higher

I'm still in it like that
Baby, I'm a love junkie like that

But, you don't wanna know me
Know me...

"Honey"

Give me the courage to say all the shit I mean
Give me a song to rock your body, a lucid dream
I don't know how I'm gonna tell you what you really mean
Give me that honey, honey, love you've got the recipe

Y'know
I see love in every space
I see sex in every city, every town
I wonder what us two could make
'Coz I feel so good around you
Can you imagine what we'd get up to?

There's something different about tonight
I could speak, or just let my body explain
I'm getting close to satisfied
And I've learned so much about you
Don't know your name, that's something we'll get to, yeah

Overdrive
My body's working in overdrive
Don't care how late, let's go overtime
Mantra, eternally in my mind
In my mind

Give me the courage to say all the shit I mean
Give me a song to rock your body, a lucid dream
I don't know how I'm gonna tell you what you really mean
Give me that honey, honey, love you've got the recipe
Give me the courage to say all the shit I mean
Give me a song to rock your body, a lucid dream
I don't know how I'm gonna tell you what you really mean
Give me that honey, honey, love you've got the recipe

I don't pray a lot, God knows
But I'm calling in favours like I believe
Don't go bringing me that close
'Coz I feel so good around you
I'm going in tonight like I love you, yeah

Overdrive
My body's working in overdrive
Don't care how late, let's go overtime
Mantra, eternally in my mind
In my mind

Give me the courage to say all the shit I mean
Give me a song to rock your body, a lucid dream
I don't know how I'm gonna tell you what you really mean
Give me that honey, honey, love you've got the recipe

"How To Stay With You"

Cut my garden down
I've got no flowers, but it's the thought that counts
Wish you lived a little closer
Maybe when we're a little older
We can set up shop
Back where you are or I can take you home
I feel like my brother might like you
Just not in the same way I do, yeah

Boy, I wish you were the piece
To get me out the game
If I have to say what I mean
Is it fair to say?
All of these visions
Impair my decisions
And I can't stop

I'm a little bit fucked on this
I'm a little bit out of time to spend with you
Baby, turn around, give me one more kiss
I'm a little bit lost on how to stay with you

I turn my ... out
It's been a sec, but I didn't forget
How to pull you in closer
In case it's not till we're older
That we reach the top
The pinnacle of everything we are
I feel like my mother might like you
Just not in the same way I do

Boy, I wish you were the piece
To get me out the game
If I have to say what I mean
Is it fair to say?
All of these visions
Impair my decisions
And I can't stop

I'm a little bit fucked on this
I'm a little bit out of time to spend with you
Baby, turn around, give me one more kiss
I'm a little bit lost on how to stay with you

Starting again when I got all I wanted
Starting to feel a little bit despondent, yeah
Starting again when I got all I wanted
Starting to feel a little bit despondent

"Angel Baby"

I need a lover to keep me sane
Pull me from hell bring me back again
Play me the classics
Something romantic
Give him my all when I don't even have it
I always dreamed of a solemn face
Someone who feels like a holiday
But now I'm in pieces, barely believing
Starting to think that I've lost all feeling

You came out the blue on a rainy night, no lie
I tell you how I almost died, while you're bringing me back to life

I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
Started giving up on the word forever
Until you give up heaven so we could be together

You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel, baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby

I'll fall in love with the little things
Counting the tattoos on your skin
Tell me a secret
And baby I'll keep it
And maybe we can play house for the weekend

You came out the blue on a rainy night, no lie
I'll tell you how I almost died
While you're bringing me back to life

I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
Started giving up on the word forever
Until you give up heaven so we could be together

You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel, baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby

All the sick and twisted nights that I've been waiting for ya
They were worth it all along, yeah

I just wanna live in this moment forever
'Cause I'm afraid that living couldn't get any better
Started giving up on the word forever (Ooh, forever)
Until you give up heaven so we could be together

You're my angel, angel baby
Angel, you're my angel, baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby
Angel, angel baby (You're my angel, baby)
Angel, you're my angel, baby
Baby, you're my angel, angel baby

"Blue Moon"

In my free, in my wild.
In my dark, oh we started.
Started to doubt, doubt this fire.
Lighting up our lives, and it kept me up at night.
Crash and burn is all I know,
I think that's why I made you go.
Those three words, you were my first,
I can't help thinking...

Maybe you were my blue moon,
maybe I let go too soon.
Running from what could be,
so terrified of happy,
how did I come to lose...
My blue moon
My blue moon

Which one of us, went and fucked up?
You and me... I guess it was me.
Don't know a good thing when
it's right in front of me cause I'm so numb.
What have I become?
Oh, cause crash and burn is all I know.
I think that's why I made you go.
Those three words, you were my first,
I can't help thinking...

Maybe you were my blue moon,
maybe I let go too soon.
Running from what could be,
so terrified of happy,
how did I come to lose...
My blue moon
My blue moon

Crash and burn is all I know,
I think that's why I made you go.
Those three words, you were my first,
I can't help thinking...

Maybe you were my blue moon,
maybe I let go too soon.
Running from what could be,
so terrified of happy,
how did I come to lose my blue...

Maybe you were my blue moon,
maybe I let go too soon.
Running from what could be, 
so terrified of happy,
how did I come to lose,
My blue moon

"could cry just thinkin about you (Full Version)"

We wrote a life all by ourselves
Wish I could put it back on the shelf
But there's a dazzling wave that keeps me at bay with you, my love
I ride this one all by myself

I could cry just thinking about you
Every line I write is something about you
Every guy I want looks something just like you
Every book I read I only read for you
Every art piece is just to remind you
I don't know who I am with or without you
But I guess I'm 'bout to find out
Yeah, I guess I'm 'bout to find out

We took a trip and made the best
We laughed and played, then laid to rest
But life's a blackening way of drifting us further than we are, oh yeah
And now we're knee-deep in this mess

I could cry just thinking about you
Every line I write is something about you
Every guy I want looks something just like you
Every book I read I only read for you
Every art piece is just to remind you
I don't know who I am with or without you
But I guess I'm 'bout to find out

"Easy (Remix)"
(feat. Mark Ronson)

Woo!

You ran away to find something to say
I went astray to make it okay
And he made it easy, darlin'
I'm still in love and I say that because
I know how it seems between you and me
It hasn't been easy darlin'

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo
Burnin' the tears right out my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please don't leave me, leave me

I'm not a saint so just give me the blame
I know what I want and it gets in my way
I know I'm not easy, darlin'
(I'm kinda a freak, my darlin')
When you see me out
I hope the taste in your mouth
Is still as sweet as I wish it could be
Believe me, darlin'
Ay, yeah, yeah, yeah

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo
Burnin' the tears right out my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please don't leave me, don't leave me

We knew what was under the surface
And lived like it wouldn't hurt us
But it hurt us

I can't even look at you
Would you look at the space just next to your feet?
The wood is warping
The lines distorting
This house is on fire, woo
Burnin' the tears right out my face
What the hell did we do?
Tell me we'll make it through

'Cause he made it easy, easy
Please don't leave me, no
Don't leave me

He made it easy
Please don't leave me
He made it easy
Please don't leave me

"For Them"

Yesterday I heard the news
That 4 million Russian children are homeless
They've been abandoned by the people they trust
Now their cold and lonely lives are hopeless

Children of the world are dying
People say they care, they're lying
If this life was theirs, they'd be crying
Is it really fair we're not trying?

Yesterday I read the news
That 20 million Asian children are homeless
They've been abandoned by the people they love
They've been beaten down so hard they can't get up

Children of the world are dying
People say they care, they're lying
If this life was theirs, they'd be crying
Is it really fair?

Children of the world
People say they care, well they're lying
If this life was theirs, they'd be crying
Is it really fair we're not trying?

Life is beautiful for some
Life is beautiful for us
Life isn't beautiful for them
Maybe life can be beautiful again for them

"Happy Little Pill (Casper Zazz Remix)"

In the crowd alone
And every second passing reminds me I'm not whole
Bright lights and city sounds are ringing like a drone
Unknown, unknown

Oh, glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills
And
My happy little pill

Like a rock I float
Sweat and conversations seep into my bones
Four walls are not enough
I'll take a dip into the
Unknown, unknown

Oh, glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill
Sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards
Gucci down the boulevard
Cocaine, dollar bills
And

My happy little pill
Take me away
Dry my eyes
Bring color to my skies
My sweet little pill
Tame my hunger
Lie within
Numb my skin

"Lonely People"
(from "Trolls Band Together" soundtrack)

This is for all the lonely people
Thinkin' that life has passed us by
We won't give up until we drink from the silver cup
And ride that highway to the sky

"My Babe"

My babe
Don't stand no cheating
My babe

Oh yeah
She don't stand no cheating
My babe

Oh yeah,
She don't stand no cheating

She don't take none of that
Midnight creepin'
My babe

True little honey
My babe

My babe
I know she love me
My babe

Oh yes
I know she love me
My babe

Oh yes
I know she love me

Don't do nothin but
Kiss and hug me
My babe

True little baby

"My My My! (Cash Cash Remix)"

Shine on, diamond
Don't make me wait another day
'Cause passion is passion
You know it just as well as me

Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move

Spark up, buzz cut
I got my tongue between your teeth
Go slow, no, no, go fast
You like it just as much as me

Now, let's stop running from love

Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us

Let's stop, my baby

"Revelation"
(from "Boy Erased" soundtrack)

You're a revelation
Won't you liberate me now
From a holy bound
You're a revolution
I will liberate you now
As the walls come down

It's a rocky road to say
Maybe I won't go
Hey dear, you're a wrecking ball
You're here crushing all I'm told

Ever I roam
Ever I roam
Further from home
Your hand I know

It's a revelation
There's no hell in what I found
No kingdom shell
How the tides are changing
As you liberate me now
And the walls come down

'Til the end
It's a rocky road to say
Maybe I won't go
Hey dear, you're a wrecking ball
You're here crushing all I'm told

Ever I roam
Ever I roam
Further from home
Your hand I know
Ever I roam
Ever I roam
Ever I roam

"Rush (Remix)"
(feat. PinkPantheress, Hyunjin of Stray Kids)

I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Yeah

Big communication, tell me what you want
Translate your vibration, let your body talk to me
Baby love, if you wanna show me what
You've been schemin' up, if you wanna (Let go)
Trust the simulation, don't you let it break
Every stimulation, promise I can take
What you wanna give? Boy, you better show me what
You've been schemin' up

You got my heartbeat racin'
My body blazin'

I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good

So good when we slow gravity, so good
It's so good, it's so good
Breathe one, two, three, take all of me, so good
It's so good, it's so good

I'm not your somebody interested in dancin'
I just told my lover, "Baby, tell me" (Yeah)
"Did you really care?" I'm two stepped with another
But you're still my sunshine, take this with me
And I finished it so I know I'm sure
Haven't done this since September
Right around then you were at my door
I can barely still remember
How did we end up on the floor?
Can we go some more?
Somehow I think we're better off just dancin'

You got my heartbeat (Heartbeat) racin' (Racin')
My body blazin'

I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good
I feel the rush
Addicted to your touch
Oh, I feel the rush
It's so good, it's so good

So good when we slow gravity, so good
It's so good, it's so good (Good)
Breathe one, two, three, take all of me, so good
It's so good, it's so good

It's so good, it's so good
Yeah
It's so good, it's so good

"Strawberries & Cigarettes"
(from "Love, Simon" soundtrack)

Remember when we first met?
You said "light my cigarette"
So I lied to my mom and dad
I jumped the fence and I ran
But we couldn't go very far
'Cause you locked your keys in your car
So you sat and stared at my lips
And I could already feel your kiss

Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights, on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

Remember when you taught me fate
Said it'd all be worth the wait
Like that night in the back of the cab
When your fingers walked in my hand
Next day, nothing on my phone
But I can still smell you on my clothes
Always hoping that things would change
But we went right back to your games

Long nights, daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Headlights, on me
Racing to 60, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

And even if I run away
And give my heart a holiday
Still strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
You always leave me wanting more
I can't shake my hunger for
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you
Yeah, they always taste like you
You
Long nights, daydreams
With that sugar and smoke rings
Always taste like you

Headlights, on me (And even if I run away)
Racing to 60, I've been a fool (And give my heart a holiday)
Still, strawberries and cigarettes always taste like
Blue eyes, black jeans (You always leave me wanting more)
Lighters and candy, I've been a fool (I can't shake my hunger for)
Strawberries and cigarettes always taste like you

"The 2012 Song"

One Direction took over the world,
All the boys and Harry's curly curls.
And Obama's back, I guess he's a hit,
Thank you, US, cause Mitt Romney's a shit.
Gangnam Style took over the tubes,
The London olympics were pretty huge.
Drake told people You Only Live Once,
Hashtag YOLO son.
Carly Jepsen said call me maybe,
And Justin said, that's not myâ¦

In 2012, ooh in 2012.
In 2012, ohh 2012.

Kony please stop acting like a prick,
The producer of that played with hisâ¦
Cole Sprouse joined tumblr, we said hello,
But now he's just somebody that we used to know.
Somebody, somebody.
That dude Felix, jumped from the sky,
Everyone thought, âhe's gonna die.â
Swag, swag, swag on you.
Personally, I started vlogging too!

In 2012, ooh in 2012.
In 2012, ohh 2012.

The world ended, we all got owned,
Oh wait shit sorry, that was postponed.

In 2012, ooh in 2012.
In 2012, ohh 2012.

In 2012, ooh in 2012.
In 2012, ohh 2012.

"The 2013 Song"

Oh and I don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I think I just shed a tear
2-0-1-3, it's been a kick-ass year

Miley went on twerked on stage
Made the whole world fill with rage
But she sold records, like she was taught
And then came around little old Lorde

Speaking of royals, they had a baby
And then came out Mr. Tom Daley!
The world's realising it's not a choice
I'm still Troye, I just happen to like boys

What? I like boys. Have you seen their butts? Exactly!

Robin Thicke went to number 1
Even though his song was sexist and dumb
Yeah that's right, I'm talking Blurred Lines
But oh shit wait, let's talk about Amanda Bynes!

Everybody said that she went a bit koo-koo
Telling Drake he should murder her hoo-hoo
We say she's the one who's going cray
But here we are asking What The Fox Say?

Oh and I don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I think I just shed a tear
2-0-1-3, it's been a kick-ass year

The US Government needed a break
Probably to go do the Harlem Shake
Catching Fire was good, dudes
Got me as excited as the Dylan Sprouse nudes

The 1D boys said This Is Us
Beyonce dropped an album without a fuss
Rest in peace, Nelson Mandela
To you, Madiba, we're indebted forever

Oh and I don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I think I just shed a tear
2-0-1-3, it's been a kick-ass year

Now do the Harlem Shake

Oh and I don't know how to feel
Just like that, 2013, it's been real
Oh and I think I just shed a tear
2-0-1-3, it's been a kick-ass year

"The Fault In Our Stars"

The weight
Of a simple human emotion
Weighs me down
More than the tank ever did

The pain
It's determined and demanding
To ache, but I'm OK

And I don't wanna let this go
I don't wanna lose control
I just wanna see the stars with you

And I don't wanna say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just wanna see the stars with you

You lost
A part of your existence
In the war against yourself

Oh, the lights,
They light up in lights of sadness
Telling you, it's time to go

And I don't wanna let this go
I don't wanna lose control
I just wanna see the stars with you

And I don't wanna say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just wanna see the stars with you

[3x]
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand for one more minute,
Don't give it up just yet
Stay grand

And I don't wanna let this go
I don't wanna lose control
I just wanna see the stars with you

And I don't wanna say goodbye
Someone tell me why
I just wanna see the stars with you

With you

"Trouble"

Accidental lover, what you do with all my common sense?
You came in undercover when I didn't even want a friend

I'm tired of living like I'm dying
But now I can find the silver lining like before
Yeah, like before
You got a funny sense of timing
Showed up on the night that I stopped trying for something more
For something more

And I'm like, "Oh sweet God, I think I'm in trouble"
Kinda making me wonder what it's like on the other side
And I'm like, "Baby, you're kinda driving me crazy"
I'm not one to need saving, but I guess I'll give it a try

Oh my, oh my

Tandem lover, what I tell you is in confidence
Laying here together makes me wanna take a second chance

My room is spinning when I'm sober
So somebody wake me in October
Oh my God
You got a funny sense of knowing
I don't know where all this is going
But don't stop

And I'm like, "Oh sweet God, I think I'm in trouble"
Kinda making me wonder what it's like on the other side
And I'm like, "Baby, you're kinda driving me crazy"
I'm not one to need saving, but I guess I'll give it a try

Oh my, oh my

You've got me going under
Can't help but wonder if you'd be there by my side
Or should I just move along all by myself?

You've got me going under
Can't help but wonder if you'd be there by my side
Or should I, I, I

But I'm like, "Oh shit, God, I think we're in trouble"
Kinda making me wonder what it's like on the other side
And oh baby, you're kinda driving me crazy
I'm not one to need saving, but I guess I'll give it a try

Oh my, oh my

"Wait"
(from "Three Months" soundtrack)

Could've broken me like glass in an emergency
It's a giving in, where do I begin?
Pastel skies, I don't know why
I hate Florida sometimes
Is it take and take?
Or is it my mistake?

What I used to know, I don't know
Keeps spinning me out, I lose control
When it feels like I am on my own
Don't try to save me

One thing I am sure of is everything will change
Time moves fast, you grow old
Days we can't rearrange
Changing tides, I feel it in my bones
And I don't ask why and I just let them go 'cause I know
One thing I am sure of
For you, I'll wait

In the sand you dig your heels, on who I am and what is real
Only you and me, and all we're going to be

What I used to know, I don't know
Keeps spinning me out, I lose control
When it feels like I am on my own
Don't try to save me

One thing I am sure of is everything will change
Time moves fast, you grow old
Days we can't rearrange
Changing tides, I feel it in my bones
And I don't ask why and I just let them go 'cause I know
One thing I am sure of
For you, I'll wait

"We're My OTP"

Valentine's Day is creeping up on me
Still staring at you on my computer screen
Writing a fan fic in the middle of the night
'Cause this will bring us closer, right?

"You've never met them," the peasant cried
Shut the fuck up bitch! Do you wanna die?!
And I've told you before, are you deaf?
I've fallen in love with a GIF

OTP,
We're my OTP,
Baby you and me
We'd be so sexy

OTP,
We're my OTP,
Baby you and me
We'd be so sexy

Bieber fever, One Direction infection
Whatever floats your boat, what's your addiction?
And you, Tumblr, you make it so much worse
You make me feel the feels right where it hurts!

I'll love you always, I'll love you 5ever
I'll love you as much as I love Nutella... almost.

OTP,
We're my OTP,
Baby you and me
We'd be so sexy

OTP,
We're my OTP,
Baby you and me
We'd be so sexy

OTP,
We're my OTP,
Baby you and me
We'd be so sexy, oh

OTP,
We're my OTP,
(We're my OTP baby!)
Baby you and me
(OTP, OTP)
We'd be so sexy, oh

[Spoken:]
No, literally, the only thing that's stopping us from getting married is the fact that we haven't "met yet".

"WILD (Remix)"
(feat. Alessia Cara)

Trying hard not to fall
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down, down
Kissing up on fences
And up on walls
On the way home
I guess it's all working out, now

'Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh

Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild

'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild

You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild

Weâre alike you and I
Two blue hearts locked in our wrong minds
So can we make the most out of no time?
Can you hold me?
Can you make me leave my demons & my broken pieces behind?

'Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild

'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild

You're driving me wild, wild, wild

You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild

You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild

Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild

'Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild 

You're driving me wild, wild, wild
