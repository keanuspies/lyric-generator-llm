"Generous Heart"

What if I can't prove the strength of your touch?
My cries alone are not good enough
When I am with you, I don't feel much at all
You asked if you were working towards the fall

I have nothing to say about love anymore
Love is nothing, I am yours

You're in my body, in my house, I can
Drag you toward my generous heartland
But I'm spilling out around you, I need
Your help, I can't last, all in a frenzy

I have nothing to say about love anymore
Love is nothing, I am yours

I'm braced for kindness, slack insensitive
Woman, I'm being a little abrasive

Guess I don't need to run away with this love
I don't need to protect, I should be afraid of this love
I know it's my fault, I need to lie dead
To find a cascade toward something but red

I have nothing to say about love anymore
Love is nothing, I am yours
I have nothing to say about love anymore
Love is nothing, I am yours

"So Long"

I cannot hide my cards, dear
Can't even keep them close
I've seen how swiftly thoughts can
Collect into ghosts
When you should fear them most

I am not a coward
I am just afraid
Of how our new tomorrow
Will turn to yesterday

So long, so long
You know I understand
So long, so long
I'll see you when I can
When I can

You and I spoke last night
As I lay next to him
You told me if you fallowed
Every paper whim
You'd be wearing thin

I woke up with a longing
For just that mistake
Your ghost was calling
I was just beyond the break

So long, so long
You know I understand
So long, so long
I'll see you when I can
When I can

I'd like to tell you now dear
To pry open the door
I'd appeal to your body
To take me on the floor
To ask a ghost for more

The glorious will always
Be just around the bend
But I can't ask to borrow
What I can't bare to lend

So long, so long
You know I understand
So long, so long
I'll see you when I can
When I can

"By Myself"

I pulled you around the balcony
To break a hive you couldn't see
And buzzed for your big mouth to feed
On honey that ran out of me to choose you
And I'm playing with myself

I talked in rings to turn your spine
Losing memory of mine
But standing in a sturdy line
Doing all I can to confuse you
And I'm talking to myself

I prefer my dreams of you
To anything you'd ever do
So please don't play or talk or move
Before I have the chance to abuse you
And I'm dreaming of myself

I play Caliban in bed
Turn my mind out, bang my head
So I forget what you said
That I'll wind up dead before I bruise you
And I'm beating up myself
I'm beating up myself

Woe is me, I'm black and blue
At least I always tell the truth

"Animal Enough"

No one is animal enough to take up the space in my mind
That I don't wanna occupy
No one is animal enough to take up the space in my body
Traded lovin' for a hobby

And I hope you find something you like
And what lies behind your "Nevermind"
Hope you find some way to see
No one is animal enough for me

I've got too much to talk about
Without your hand over my mouth
A whimper leaves me like a shout
I've got too much to talk about after every single lie
I slip before your eagle eyes

And I hope you find something you like
And what lies behind your "Nevermind"
Hope you find some way to see
No one is animal enough for me

I've got options, I've got time but I am so impatiently
Giving them away for free
I've got options, I've got time but my muscle memory
Leads me walkin' down your street

And I hope you find something you like
And what lies behind your "Nevermind"
Hope you find some way to see
No one is animal enough
I hope you find something you like
And what lies behind your "Nevermind"
Hope you find some way to see
No one is animal enough for me

"Coverage"

Here is light in little rooms
Water colors, camera moves
Fooling you into the myth
Even my little laugh's a wish

Growing up a memory
Becoming who I used to be
Cover me, uncover you
Is that really what I'd do?

If I were really here
Looking at you beamin'
If I were really alive, could I
Make it through every day dreamin'?

I told you it's gums and teeth
There's nothing moving underneath
But there are shades you can't replace
With blush or blues or lights or grace

Here is where I put my trust
If you tell a lie enough
You can't pick it from the truth
It's been of tremendous use

If I were really here
Looking at you beamin'
If I were really alive, could I
Make it through every day dreamin'?
Dreamin'

Growing up a memory
Becoming who I used to be
Cover me, uncover you
Is that really what I'd do?

If I were really here
Looking at you beamin'
If I were really alive, could I
Make it through every day dreamin'?
If I were really here
Looking at you beamin'
If I were really alive, could I
Make it through every day dreamin'?

Dreamin'
Dreamin'

"Hold The Sun"

If I could, I would kiss you
The body doesn't lie
I'd hold you like soft water
Holds the sun against the sky
I know that she loves you
So I wouldn't dare to try
Hold you like soft water
Holds the sky

I'll turn in my lips
My heavy hands and say goodbye
'Cause I can't hear you moan
And I can't hear you sigh
I can't think about the singer
With her hand against your thigh
When all I want's to hold you
Like the sun holds the sky

I see the night has crept through your hair
To settle in your eyes
And I know until I break it
The tension will only rise
So here I will declare it
In a low but desperate cry
I wanna hold you like soft water
Holds the sky
I wanna hold you like soft water
Holds the sky

"River Like You"

I've loved a river like you before
I'm the one to blame
He washed away my cleverness
And hallowed out my name
I've loved a river like you before
The deep and thundering kind
He rushed into my belly and
Clouded over my eyes

If you wanted to be happy, which I somehow doubt
I could swallow your river if you opened your mouth

I've loved a river like you before
You can't scare me away
I've tamed the moss up on the rocks
And molded the red clay

If you wanted to be happy, which would be a surprise
I could swallow your sorrow if you opened your eyes

I've loved a river like you before
I'm a river too
So you can run into me
And I'll run into you

If you wanted to be happy, which I somehow doubt
I could swallow your river if you opened your mouth

I've loved a river like you before
If only I were wise
I never learned to turn and run
When I saw the water rise

"Bringing Me Down"

Feeling small, feeling ordinary
Not strong enough for all I carry
It's a light weight if you look around
So I must be weak if it's bringing me down

Feeling dumb or at least unlearned
Under a pile of books, I'm burdened
They're small ideas if you look around
So I must be weak if they're bringing me down

Feeling tired, so tired and lonely
Trying to believe kind words you told me
Guess I'm okay if you look around
So I must be weak if it's bringing me down

I have lied, I've lied and hidden
I've done things they deem forbidden
They're small crimes if you look around
So I must be weak if they're bringing me down

Mmm, bringing me down

Losing faith in the task at hand
Asking questions I don't understand
Nobody knows if you look around
So I must be weak if it's bringing me down

I wanna try to lift my spirits
Sing a song, if you wanna hear it
It's not much if you look around
But I must be weak if it's bringing me down

If it's bringing me down
If it's bringing me down
If it's bringing me down
If it's bringing me down

"Cricket"

There are places you can go when you're in the afterglow
And the lights hang above and below you
There are people you can find in that secret peace of mind
When you fear that no one knows you

The Earth's still spinnin', I promise nothing's wrong
You like it when we're dizzy, you can see what's really goin' on

There are cities you'll survive if you hang your head and hide
From the map that swears it'll guide you
You were feelin' really weak, had your harvest in your cheeks
On your knees for me to hide you

The Earth's still spinnin', I promise nothing's wrong
You like it when we're dizzy, you can see what's really goin' on

Really goin' on
Really goin' on

You were on the attack, but you had to take it back
'Cause you know there's nothing they owe you
The sun is risin' soon, but you're howlin' at the moon
'Cause you've heard it's got a lot to show you

The Earth's still spinnin', I promise nothing's wrong
You like it when we're dizzy, you can see what's really goin' on

Really goin' on
Really goin' on
On

There are prayers you can share
It's your fault, it's not fair
And in the end, no one can really make you
If you're bleedin' from a bite
Or basking, burning in the light
You see, really anything can break you

Well, the Earth's still spinnin', I promise nothing's wrong
You like it when we're dizzy, you can see what's really goin' on

Really goin' on
Really goin' on

One, two

"Menace"

Turn my gaze away
Relieve the impressions
That I've made
Like rain in my creeping hand
I want to behave
It's a small concession
All my regressions
I don't understand

But they're painful old news
And pale in comparison
To choosing you

Well, I don't wanna be a menace anymore
What could a menace be good for?
So I will catch my wandering eye, watch the roses pass me by
And I'll try to make my menace into someone you'd adore

It's dangerous and short
Covertly calls for
An encore
The attention of strangers
As long as loving lasts
You don't want to
Here forever
Everybody loves a lover

Well, you really shouldn't ask
'Cause the answer's always, "Always"
'Til always is in the past

Well, I don't wanna be a menace anymore
What could a menace be good for?
So I will catch my wandering eye and watch the roses pass me by
And I'll try to make my menace into someone you'd adore

Well, you really shouldn't ask
'Cause the answer's always, "Always"
'Til always is in the past

Well, I don't wanna be a menace anymore
What could a menace be good for?
So I will catch my wandering eye, watch the roses pass me by
No, I don't wanna be a menace anymore
What could a menace be good for?
So I will catch my wandering eye, watch the roses pass me by
And I'll try to make my menace into someone you'd adore

"Goodbye Rocketship"

I do what you tell me like it's my idea
I came down to find you, pretend that you're here
And I never could replace you, it's too dark to try
But I look for our memories, and their clothing, and their eyes

You didn't know, you didn't know

You're there when I need you, we talk on the phone
I know that you've been trying to build us a home
Yet I scramble to find one with couches and boys
But all I hear's an echo, the sound of your voice

You didn't know, you didn't know

You may have more to teach me, but what haven't I heard?
Listening is easy, but learning is earned
I forgive you, and I thank you, you know all the reasons why
I'm sorry and I love you, all we can do is try

You didn't know how to raise me
Any more than I knew how to grow up
Childhood is over, and it wasn't enough

But Nina's in the garden and Rascal's on the roof
The charges against you, I know I have no proof
So goodbye to the Chelsea, goodbye to the rocket ship
There's only room for you and me there
And there's so much more to fit

You didn't know, you didn't know
You didn't know, you didn't know
You didn't know, you didn't know

"Mirth"

Twistin' around on blue leather booth
My ears still popping from travel and use
I picked at my oatmeal and plumped up my lips
He gives his hand a suggestion, wish
It's not you, it's New York I miss

I've got a problem I think he could fix
He seems to undo all my usual tricks
But the marks on his belly, the lines I trace
Shadow softness and romantic grace
It's not you, it's New York I face

I dreamt of him on a JetBlue flight
Nursing me into a feverish night
Lay on my back, whisperin' his name
Letting him unravel a decade of blame
It's not you, it's New York I claim

Well, in a thunder breath, I coughed up my heart
My life in my hands, a good place to start
Little creature born of joy and mirth
Loving without the help of anything
Little creature born of joy and mirth
Loving without the help of anything
On earth
It's not you, it's New York that works

"Backup Plan"

Your pencils, your dress socks
Your charger, your bike lock
Anything that's not in your junk drawer

I wanna be anything you've lost that you might be lookin' for

Your dirtbag, your small cash
Your pocket change, your eyelash
The kitty lurking out behind your door

I wanna be anything you've lost that you might be lookin' for
I wanna be anything you've lost that you might be lookin' for

Light a fire, live without it
Have a dark thought and tell me all about it
Your backup plan, your best man
Your torrid affair, your long hair

Go away, don't get too far, it's not the first time
I've been kicked out of bed for a guitar

The dream you planted in your forest
Your winter coat in summer storage
Your favorite game, your secret shame, your eyesore

I wanna be anything you've lost that you might be lookin' for
I wanna be anything you've lost that you might be lookin' for

"Bloomed Into Blue"

As a babbling baby
They blessed her a bastard birth
So, out they let her, quick as a blur
Through the backdoor, her bawling mother
Bled onto the bed boards
Bewinged, she flew
With valor and glow
Drinkin' up clouds
Bird-callin' to crows
Mid-air, she grew up
And out and sideways
She sang and she swooped
She peddled her play

She bloomed into blue
She bloomed into blue, into blue

Blokes were watching from below
Brows breaking
"Be still," she begged
As the blokes were shaking
Fed up, she descended
Frolicked in town
Her wings folded in
As her toes touched down
The blokes bid for her party
She sidestepped
She packed into blue
Blood on her biceps
They switched, mixed
Whispers of "weakling" and "witch"
She listened and let out
A sigh, a hiss

She bloomed into blue
She bloomed into blue, into blue

Boastfully looked at
Their blistering faces
She bowed low mocking
Their grisly graces
From the crowd, the blokes
Burst out simplistic
She can't be herself
She's gone ballistic
"Bend over, you bedraggled basket babe"
Nothing is sacred (Nothing is secret)
You're begging, unbrave
Please let me build something
Please let me be
I have beliefs in my brain
I'm a bottomless sea

She bloomed into blue
She bloomed into blue
She bloomed into blue
She bloomed into blue
She bloomed into blue
She bloomed into blue, into blue

(Break out of your beauty)
(By a standard, you weren't raised right)
She bloomed into blue, into blue
(She asked her biochemistry)
("Stop being you for a bit")
(Button up into blue, button up into blue)

"Hiatus"

I like your weird clothes, your needy demeanor
I like your days off and your key carabiner
I like your big head, your little taut body
I like your fine threads and your ridiculous hobbies

I know you bleed glitter and you have a heart of stone
All I really want's an actor of my own

Your affected walk, your witty conversation
Your free pillow talk, the way that you seek validation
Let's go on vacation, get soft and complacent
Take home a big puppy, get mean and impatient

I know you bleed glitter and you have a heart of stone
But all I really want's an actor of my own

I say, "I love Shepard," I wanna hear you say, "Me too"
I say, "I'm free tomorrow," I wanna hear "What should we do?"
I want a gym routine, self-obsessed, hardly dressed teen dream
Who cares about sunscreen and loves to make me Wilhelm scream
'Cause it sounds like applause
Maybe he'll cheat on me, but I'll forgive him when he does

I know you bleed glitter and you have a heart of stone
But all I really want's an actor of my own

The Inn in Baton Rouge
She was a late-shift waitress
With a pour heavy, now you're home on hiatus
Does she hold a candle to me?
I kissed my co-star in rehearsal anyway
(I'd like to hear that one)

"Sweet Tooth"

Told my mother that I love her
And that I'd lie to the accountant if she wants
I'll do whatever to protect her
I'll say anything just to make her stop

I saw a movie everybody hated
In an empty theatre in Duluth
Swear I really loved it
Love is such a better thing to do

I'm grateful for everything you put me through
It's the only reason I'm any good to talk to
When I'm sick or suffering, I'll still call you
About my big, sore sweet tooth

Search frantic for the moonlight
I bat I get cold beneath the stars
And instead, I found a soundbite
Of someone I love saying something mean and hard

Forgot I have a piece of plastic
In the place where my molar used to be
Sucking on a summer cherry
When you called, I bit hard into the seed

I'm grateful for everything you put me through
It's the only reason I'm any good to talk to
When I'm sick or suffering, I'll still call you
About my big, sore sweet tooth

So, my molar collapsed on me
Like a glacier melting in the heat
My mouth full up with lightning
I'm an outlet shock, a hole, a need
So, everybody loves you
And every little bit helps
I broke my bone, it was the worst she ever felt

I'm grateful for everything you put me through
It's the only reason I'm any good to talk to
When I'm sick or suffering, I'll still call you
About my big, sore sweet tooth

Big, sore sweet tooth
(Big, sore sweet tooth)
(Big, sore sweet tooth)
(Big, sore sweet tooth)
(Big, sore sweet tooth)
(Big, sore sweet tooth)
(Big, sore sweet tooth)
(Big, sore sweet tooth)
(Big, sore sweet tooth)
Da, da, da, da

"Crazy Kid"
(feat. Will Graefe)

I'm not a crazy kid, with you, I'm all grown up
Your phone is ringing and you don't pick up
You've been through the ringer and you've knocked yourself out
But your dust hasn't settled and you can't settle down
I'm grazing the clouds with my fingertips
Talkin' too loud, I'm havin' fun with it
And I'm thinkin' 'bout your innocence

I wanna be as tall as you can be
You've been breakin' your back bendin' down for me
It's cool in the shade of your shadow divine
Now the sun's on my face and it's burning my eyes
And I'm runnin' in place, now I'm fallin' behind
It's cool in the shade of your shadow divine

I never told you one true thing
I let you believe I'd been alone all spring
But our voices quivered and we took a deep breath
Like we got somethin' heavy off of our chest
I wanted everything mine to be yours too
Including the pain of losing you
I see you when I see your blue

Wanna be as tall as you can be
You've been breakin' your back bendin' down for me
It's cool in the shade of your shadow divine
Now the sun's on my face and it's burning my eyes
And I'm runnin' in place, now I'm fallin' behind
It's cool in the shade of your shadow divine
It's cool in the shade of your shadow divine

Cool in the shade, cool in the shade
Cool in the shade
Cool in the shade
I glow in the dark
You can take me apart, me apart
I glow in the dark
You can take me apart, me apart
I glow in the dark (If you asked me to, I come crawling back)
You can take me apart, me apart
I glow in the dark (If you asked me to, I come crawling back)
You can take me apart, me apart (Cool in the shade, cool in the shade)
I glow in the dark (If you asked me to, I come crawling back)
You can take me apart, me apart (Cool in the shade, cool in the shade)
If you asked me to then I'd come crawling right back for you
I glow in the dark
I'd come crawling right back for you

"Luna Moth"

I put my foot down on a luna moth
In the bathroom at your party
You screamed into my terrycloth
I said that I was sorry
You found me with a door locked
I only went upstairs to cry
I came over here to be alone
Not to kill your things that fly

I don't need anyone to hurt me
I can do that myself
I don't see why you would want me
If I could, I would be anybody else

Put a needle through a luna moth (Through a luna moth)
The one I crushed and let you down
I left it on your doorstep
But I didn't stick around (But I didn't stick around)
To watch you smile at an ugly thing
To try to ease my guilt
Watch you looking at a broken wing
Like it could be rebuilt

I don't need anyone to hurt me
I can do that myself
I don't see why you would want me
If I could, I would be anybody else
If I could, I would be anybody else

"South Elroy"

I've been under since the end of summer
When you flutter by, took all the color out of my eyes
Used up all my vibrance on South Elroy drive
When we fought and we fucked and we fought
I always took your side
Now I'm waitin' out this fever
I dream you're sliding quarters into the parkin' meter
A little more time in your beat-up black Mercedes
Parked in my burning mind
Call me crazy, crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy

Please don't forgive me
It'd be a pity after all of that
Watch me come crawlin' back
If you asked me to
I'd come crawlin' right back to you
If you asked me to
I'd come crawlin' back to you
Crawlin' back to you

I focus on the trouble each nightful
You swallowed bubbles made me beg for a biteful
Gave me your hand and moved it inside me
Smirk, what a jerk, good and plenty
I know you lied about your tattoo
Her name, your spine under my every touch
I know you lied about your plugs and glue
Funny, I really wouldn't have minded that much

Please don't forgive me
It'd be a pity after all of that
Watch me come crawlin' back
If you asked me to
I'd come crawlin' right back to you
If you asked me to
I'd come crawlin' back to you
If you asked me to (If you asked me to)
I'd come crawlin' right back to you (Crawlin' back to you)
If you asked me to
Then I'd come crawlin' right back to you
And now I'm callin' out to you

Oh my God, I gotta slow down now
(Oh my God, I gotta slow down now)
Oh my God, I gotta slow down somehow
(Oh my God, I gotta slow down somehow)
Oh my God, I gotta slow down now
(Oh my God, I gotta slow down now)
Oh my God, I gotta slow down somehow
(Oh my God, I gotta slow down somehow)
Down somehow, down somehow

"ThÃ©rÃ¨se"

(Gotta, gotta slow down)

I go see ThÃ©rÃ¨se dreamin'
She's stretchin' out her sore shoulder
Leanin' back, eyes closed, reachin' up
She's wishin' she was older
Dreamin' of an Appaloosa
Saddled up, ridin' out of town
Dreamin' of a Shelby cobra
Diggin' her tires in the ground

Bleeding, bringing in a new year's mess
Unaware of the stain on her dress

It's tactless, it's a test
It's just ThÃ©rÃ¨se, it's just ThÃ©rÃ¨se

White kitten in the corner
Obscene, it really says it all
Milk matches her underwear
And get her down, take her off the wall
She dreams of Marlon in Austin
Their bodies tangled in a net
She thinks of him every so often
When she feels like a space cadet

She empathizes with your feelings
She's more interested in ceilings

It's tactless, it's a test
It's just ThÃ©rÃ¨se, it's just ThÃ©rÃ¨se
It's tactless, it's a test
It's just ThÃ©rÃ¨se, it's just ThÃ©rÃ¨se

She reminds me of memories
Sleeping off the growing pains
We were sea anemones
Spelling out each other's names
Whispering inside our red house
While the adults were a-sleeping
I guess ThÃ©rÃ¨se was just for me
A quiet I keep on keeping

ThÃ©rÃ¨se does not belong to you
The horses, cars, and cowboys do

It's tactless, it's a test
It's just ThÃ©rÃ¨se, it's just ThÃ©rÃ¨se
It's tactless, it's a test
It's just ThÃ©rÃ¨se, it's just ThÃ©rÃ¨se
It's tactless, it's a test
It's just ThÃ©rÃ¨se
It's tactless, it's a test
It's just ThÃ©rÃ¨se

"Sticky Little Words"

Writing's too slow
Talking's too fast
Lately real low
Lies at last
Oh dear, my dear
Get in all your licks
I'll string my words
Something will stick

Sticky little words
They heal and they hurt
They never really work
They feed the birds
That's it, I guess
They might make you laugh
They might make you mad
But they won't bring you back
They won't bring you back

Oh dear, my dear
There's so much to say
If you plug your lil' ears
I'll fade away
Sorry's too slow
To stop this crash
And leave me alone
Was just too fast

Sticky little words
They heal and they hurt
They never really work
They feed the birds
That's it, that's that
They might make you laugh
They might make you mad
But they won't bring you back
They won't bring you back

"Over"

Over, over, I come over, it's October
I explain that I'm a rover
Told ya, told ya
Angry, angry, now I see you're angry at me
I never said you could teach me
Leave me, leave me
I'm bound, I'm bound, you stole my ribbon
And you wound three times my worn-out throat around
No sound, no sound

I'm gonna have to be stronger than I wanted to be
I'm gonna have to be stronger than I wanted to be

No pain, no pain, I know you think I felt no pain
So tranquil now
I look so tame, no blame, no blame
A tail of woe, preordained, grim from the get-go
Time to loosen your grip, let go
I know, I know
I fear, I fear, I fear I'm gonna die right here
You would be wise now to steer clear
My dear, my dear

I'm gonna have to be stronger than I wanted to be
I'm gonna have to be stronger than I wanted to be
I'm gonna have to be stronger than I wanted to be

Empty, empty, I'm not empty, this bud keeps a bee
Like what you see, but it won't be pretty, pretty
I want my smile weak and wrong
My arms and legs real strong
I want my skin to fall, stretch long
I want my mind fresh, even when my body's rotten
I want to know more than you have forgotten
I'm not your flower, I'm the pollen

I'm gonna have to be stronger than I wanted to be
I'm gonna have to be stronger than I wanted to be
I'm gonna have to be stronger than I wanted to be

Callin', callin' out to my inner appalin' monster
She is bravin', bravin'
Savin' me from you

"Restless Moon"

I combine the weight of breathing with your active morning birds
A weakness is believing in my imagination of yours
I see it, though, I do, in the turning of your mind
I see the things you think, your electric body beside

Your body beside
The tide is in, it will go out
I remember when you said that
I know you meant it now
I know you meant it now

Took interest in the roses on your button-down
I was fascinated by the colors on that cow
We did a lot of talking, unnaturally awake
You said it makes you feel sad to watch me make mistakes

My body beside
The tide is in, it will go out
I remember when you said that
I know you meant it now
The tide is in, it will go out
I remember when you said that
I know you meant it now
I know you meant it now

Drink up all the darkness
Choke on the moon in your mouth
Drink up all the darkness
Choke on the moon in your mouth
Drink up all the darkness
Choke on the moon in your mouth

Drink up all the darkness
I know you did it for show
I watched you swallow the moon
And now your belly glows
The reflection of the sunlight
On your regular stone

You're full of holes, I know
You're full of holes, I know

"Driver"

One, two, three, one

I cook and I clean now
I do different things than I used to do
Feel I'm always rinsin' dishes
I load them and I think about you
I imagine my mom and dad
Loosely neckin' in the back of a taxi cab
I'd give everything I'll ever have to see them happy
Kissin' just like that

And oh, I can watch it in the movies
I don't wanna see it that crafted and clear
Wanna be the pervert driver
Gazin' at them through a tilted mirror

I stay up, I play Backgammon now
Not to dirty a glass, I drink straight from the spout
I sleep through the night now
On the medication you left at my house
I miss you like the soft spot at the top of my baby skull's rose
I miss you like my fontanels
I miss you like my openness that closed

Now I'll tell you a secret
A secret that everyone already knows
You remind me of my father
Your attitude, your disheveled clothes

Thinkin' of you makes me happy
Happy that my father, he got free
That even though it hurt me
He can be whoever the hell he wants to be

You see, a free man can be a relied on
Trusted not to let go of the bike
Nothin' stickin' his feet to the ground
No one's holdin' a string to his kite

"Mermaid Bar"

There was no moon black sky on the night
I jumped from the bridge toward the river
I swear, I saw silver star light
On the water's surface, a shimmer
Pounded the pulse, I couldn't finish
Didn't hear a splash or feel the cold
Was full of bubbles for a minute

Turned to ice, then cycloid scales of gold
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, no
Turned to ice, then cycloid scales of gold
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, no

My lungs deflated, my fingers weaved
Rips separated for gills to breathe
Ran my tongue over my sharp new teeth
Panicked, swimming, collapsed in the reeds
Taken with the current to the sea
Tide disrupting desperate dreams
My belly empty, body weak

I had no sound, no way to speak
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, no
I had no sound, no way to speak
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, no

I was close to quiet death again
When new instincts woke me from the spell
I killed a Diamondback terrapin
Was most scared of my awful self
I woke up on cold stones, broken glass
Winter beach at Long Island's end
I found that I could still maneuver

Slip slide on the sand and the cement
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, no
Slip slide on the sand and the cement
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, no

I opened sardine dream mermaid bar
We serve most oysters and caviar
Leave your seashells in our tall tip jar
There are more like me, I swear, there are
Come for scallops, come to hear our song
Come if you're in awful, bad trouble
Come if you're certain you don't belong

Some that fall, don't land in bubbles
'Cause some that fall, don't land in bubbles (In bubbles, bubbles)
Some that fall, don't land in bubbles
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, no
Some that fall, don't land in bubbles (Bubbles, bubbles)
Some that fall, don't land in bubbles

"Blue Hippo"

She sat on the cliff of the bed
Tackled me with a plastic comb
Pressed her fingers into my head
Start at the blonde, search for the bone
She tries to tame me, her nails and my knots
Bathe with the sandman, dress up for what's not

Let me tangle, let me dry
Want it wicked, let me ride

Come into my cave
Blue hippo into the black
I'm your problem child
Your matter of fact

I slyly side-step, sorry
Drag my heels across the street
She tells me I'm unlettered while
I read the backs of her knees
Catch me in habits, one tight skyward eye
Pull hats out of rabbits and salt out of the sky

Let me tangle, let me try
Want it wicked, let me rile

Come into my cave
Blue hippo into the black
I'm your problem child (Problem)
Your matter of fact

What I thought was in whale water
Was really runnin' through the pipes
To show off her flexibility
She made a fool of my fight
I bit her belly, she bellowed like a swan
Cured me like a petal pressed in her open palm

Let me tangle, let me dry
Want it wicked, let me rile

Come into my cave
Blue hippo into the black
I'm your problem child (Problem)
Your matter of fact
Come into my cave
Blue hippo into the black
I'm your problem child (Problem)
Your matter of fact

"Coming Around Again"

A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart

I know nothing stays the same
If you're willing to play the game
You will be coming around again

Don't mind if I fall apart
There's more room in a broken heart

A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart
A broken heart

I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
You will be coming around again

I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
You will be coming around again

Don't mind if I fall apart
There's more room in a broken heart

I believe in love
So what else can I do
I'm so in love with you

I believe in you
I believe in love
I believe in love
I believe in love

I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
You will be coming around again

I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
You will be coming around again

Don't mind if I fall apart
There's more room in a broken heart

"Rose And Thorn"

I was talking to myself
You leaned in to hear
I caught your silky laugh
Like a ribbon in my ear
You lay distracted
Like Truman on the ropes
I stood sunburnt and naked
So heavy with hope

And I'm not sure
If I was promised or warned
When you said you'd be my rose and thorn

If you'd like to bloom
I will make it rain
With the pigs that made it to the moon
And a dog who learned her name
I want you to understand
But you just can't win
I write our names upon the sand
And you watch the tide come in

And I've been waiting for you, baby
Since the day I was born
You'll always be my rose and thorn

No one else will ever hurt me
No one else will get to try
No one else has petals
That fall up towards the sky

I know I'm too preoccupied
With what lays ahead
But I can't seem to settle on
What to think about instead
I should live in the moment
But I'd never make it home
I'd lay here with my hands on you
Till I was only breath and bone

And I'm not sure
If I was promised or warned
When you said you'd be my rose and thorn
And I've been waiting for you, baby
Since the day I was born
You'll always be my rose and thorn

"Stay Open"

Close the door behind me
Lock up when I leave
Nurse my pride, throw in a please
But I'll do anything you ask

Things will change, they always do
But my heart will stay open
For you

Sorry that I lost your key
I'm not accustomed to security
There's nothing you could promise me
That would let me catch my breath

Things will change, they always do
But my heart will stay open
For you

This cold wind comes quickly
Through an open door
And every blow lands heavy
When you want more
But, baby, I am ready
Whatever's in store

Stumble over your fine line
Falling further every time
Speak the words, it's in your eyes
That I don't wanna guess

Things will change, they always do
But my heart will stay open
For you

I'm not sure we get to choose
Love can make a child of you
But when I try and tell the truth
Out comes your little name

Things will change, they always do
But my heart will stay open
For you

My heart will stay open for you
My heart will stay open for you

"To Love A Boy"

I want to love a boy
The way I love the ocean
Wish I was not afraid
Of all I have that's broken
I know I must behave
To contain all my emotion

But I want to love a boy
The way I love the ocean

Like a hidden cave
I am always open
I hold the space you made
I'm empty but still hoping
I have a feeling
A terrible fear encroaching

That I'll never love a boy
The way I Iove the ocean

I ask why
It's better to speak than it is to die
One more try
It's better to laugh than it is to lie

I thought I had a man
Someone who could hold me
But nobody can
I wish someone had told me
I was born yesterday
And I'm still wet, still soaking

And I want to love a boy
The way I love the ocean
The way I love the ocean
The way I love the ocean

"We Don't Run"

We don't run, we don't compromise
We don't quit, we never do
We look for love, we find it in the eyes
The eyes of me and the eyes of you

You are the road, you are the only way
I'll follow you forever more
We'll look for love, we'll find it in the eyes
The eyes that see through all the doors

There is a train that races through the night
On rails of steel that reach the soul
Fueled by fire as soft as candle light
But it warms the heart of a love grown cold

We don't run, we don't compromise
We don't quit, we never do
We look for love, we find it in the eyes
The eyes of me and the eyes of you

Words that feel, words that sympathize
Words that heal and understand
Say them now, let them materialize
Say the words throughout the land

We don't run, we don't compromise
We don't quit, we sometimes do
We look for love, we find it in the eyes
The eyes of me and the eyes of you

We don't run, we don't compromise
We don't quit, we never do
We look for love, we find it in the eyes
The eyes of me and the eyes of you
